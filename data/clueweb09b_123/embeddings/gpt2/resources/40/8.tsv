Primarily the band consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). The Beatles are recognised for leading the mid-1960s musical "" British Invasion "" into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and homegrown  skiffle , the group explored  genres  ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, styles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music , selling over one billion records internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles reached #1 again.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . After a tour in Scotland, the band changed their name to ""The Beatles"".   In May 1960, the then Silver Beetles toured northeast Scotland as a back-up band with  Johnny Gentle . [ 11 ]  For the tour, the group secured the services of Tommy Moore, who was considerably older than the others. [ 13 ]  Moore left the band soon after the tour. [ 14 ]  His departure posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 15 ]     196062: Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. Best had played with The Blackjacks in  The Casbah Coffee Club , owned by his mother,  Mona Best . [ 16 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began playing in Hamburg at the Indra Club and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960. On 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 17 ]  A week later, having started a small fire at their living quarters while vacating it for more luxurious rooms, McCartney and Best were arrested for arson and deported. [ 18 ]  Lennon followed the others to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 19 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the "" Top Ten Club "". They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 20 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 21 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 22 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the Decca label for United States disc jockeys. [ 23 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 24 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 25 ]   The band returned to Liverpool from Germany, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 26 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein , owner of the North End Music Store (NEMS) on Great Charlotte Street, saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. Epstein became aware of the group after he received requests for the Sheridan/Beatles recording of ""My Bonnie.""   In a meeting with the group on 10 December 1961, Brian Epstein proposed the idea of managing the group. [ 27 ]  The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 28 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract.  Decca Records   A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 29 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 30 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 31 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 32 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain hemorrhage . [ 33 ]     1962: Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 34 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 35 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 36 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 37 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 38 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 39 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 40 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.     196263: Fame in the UK          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 41 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "".   The band also began to be noticed by serious music critics.   In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. It was designed by London drum dealer Ivor Arbiter. [ 42 ] [ 43 ]     196364: American success   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 44 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 45 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 46 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 47 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 48 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising, and completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 49 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964         196466: Beatlemania crosses the Atlantic   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 50 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 51 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 52 ]  After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 53 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 54 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 55 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 56 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 57 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No  beatles music  was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay  beatles album  Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  meet the beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 58 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 59 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 60 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  beatles for sale .   In June 1965,  Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 63 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 64 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 65 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 66 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 66 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 67 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 68 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 67 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 68 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 69 ]                         ""Help!""          "

The “Fab Four” from Liverpool, England, startled the ears and energized the lives of virtually all who heard them. Their arrival triggered the musical revolution of the Sixties, introducing a modern sound and viewpoint that parted ways with the world of the previous decade. The pleasurable jolt at hearing “She Loves You” and “I Want to Hold Your Hand - given the doldrums into which rock and roll had fallen in recent years - was comparable to the collective fever induced by Presley’s “That’s All Right (Mama)” and “Heartbreak Hotel” nearly ten years earlier.     The Beatles’ music - with its simultaneous refinement (crisp harmonies, solid musicianship, canny pop instincts) and abandon (energetic singing and playing, much screaming and shaking of mop-topped locks)  ignited the latent energy of youth on both sides of the Atlantic. They helped confer self-identity upon a youthful, music-based culture that flexed its muscle in myriad ways - not just as music consumers but also as a force for political expression, social commentary and contemporary lifestyles.      Landing on these shores on February 7, 1964, they literally stood the world of pop culture on its head, setting the musical agenda for the remainder of the decade. The Beatles’ buoyant melodies, playful personalities and mop-topped charisma were just the tonic needed by a nation left reeling by the senseless assassination of its young president, John F. Kennedy, two months earlier. Even adults typically given to dismissing rock and roll conceded that there was substance in their music and cleverness in their quick-witted repartee. Between the lines, and without obvious disrespect, the Beatles announced the ascendancy of youth - and the inevitable coming of a generation gap as a result.      The long journey resulting in the mob scene that greeted the Beatles’ arrival at Kennedy Airport began in Liverpool. In 1958,  John Lennon  formed a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. Lennon was raised on Fifties rockabilly and was especially partial to  Elvis Presley  and  Gene Vincent . He met a similarly rock-smitten schoolkid named  Paul McCartney . Impressed by McCartneys knowledge of song lyrics and ability to tune a guitar, Lennon recruited him into the Quarrymen. A schoolmate of McCartneys,  George Harrison , came next. The youthful Harrisons mastery of guitar licks by  Duane Eddy  impressed the skeptical Lennon.       With a rhythm section consisting of bassist Stu Sutcliffe (a sharp-looking art student with negligible musical ability) and drummer Pete Best, the group eventually settled on the Beatles as their name. They became a fixture on the rough-and-tumble club scene in Hamburg, Germany, where their five-set-a-night marathons helped mold them into a tight performing unit. Their repertoire comprised well-chosen rock and roll and rhythm & blues covers by such trailblazers as  Chuck Berry  and  Little Richard . In April 1961, Sutcliffe left and McCartney switched from guitar to bass. On the local scene in their hometown of Liverpool, the group landed a lunchtime residency at a club called The Cavern, where they were discovered by a local record merchant and entrepreneur, Brian Epstein, who became their manager in December 1961. In January 1962, a fan poll in Mersey Beat declared them the top group in Liverpool.      Epstein helped polish the group’s appearance. He attired them in dapper collarless gray suits, which made them appear more accessible than the menacing leathers theyd worn in Hamburg. The Beatles signed with EMI-Parlophone in April 1962 after impressing producer  George Martin . In August, fellow Liverpudlian Ringo Starr (born Richard Starkey), then a member of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, replaced Pete Best. The group’s first single, “Love Me Do/P.S. I Love You,” briefly dented the U.K. Top Twenty in October 1962, but their next 45, “Please Please Me,” formally ignited Beatlemania in their homeland, reaching the Number Two spot. It was followed in 1963 by four consecutive chart-topping British singles: “From Me to You,” “She Loves You,” “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” “Can’t Buy Me Love.”     They conquered the U.K., even inducing a classical music critic from the London Sunday Times to declare them “the greatest composers since Beethoven.” Moreover, they were the greatest rockers since the composer of “Roll Over, Beethoven” - i.e.,  Chuck Berry . The freshness and immediacy of the Beatles’ sound stemmed from the fact they assimilated and synthesized the most vital sources for rock and roll that preceded them.     Writing in the Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll, Greil Marcus observed that “the form of the Beatles contained the forms of rock and roll itself. The Beatles combined the harmonic range and implicit equality of the Fifties vocal groups with the flash of a rockabilly band (the Crickets or  Gene Vincent ’s Blue Caps) with the aggressive and unique personalities of the classic rock stars (Elvis,  Little Richard ) with the homey, this-could-be-you manner of later rock stars (Everly Brothers,  Buddy Holly ,  Eddie Cochran ) with the endlessly inventive songwriting touch of the Brill Building, and they delivered it all with the grace of the Miracles, the physicality of ‘Louie, Louie,’ and the absurd enthusiasm of Gary U.S. Bonds.      The Beatles success can be attributed to a combination of factors, including Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting genius, Harrison’s guitar-playing prowess, Starr’s artful simplicity as a drummer, and the solid group harmonies that were a hallmark of their recordings. Personally, they had youthful high spirits, good looks, quick wit and refreshingly down-to-earth dispositions to commend them.  George Martin s production and Brian Epsteins management were important elements as well.      The Beatles’ conquest of America early in 1964 launched “the British Invasion,” a torrent of rock & roll bands from Britain that overtook the pop charts. The Fab Four’s first #1 single in the U.S. was “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” released on Capitol Records, EMI’s American counterpart. This exuberant track was followed by 45 more Top Forty hits over the next half-dozen years. During the week of April 4, 1964, the Beatles set a record that is likely never to be broken when they occupied all five of the top positions on Billboard’s Top Forty, with “Can’t Buy Me Love” ensconced at #1. Their popularity soared still further with the release of their anarchic Marx Brothers-as-rock-stars documentary film, A Hard Day’s Night (1964) and its equally playful followup, Help! (1965).      When all was said and done, the Beatles charted twenty #1 singles in the States  three more than runner-up  Elvis Presley . It is estimated by EMI, their British record company, that the Beatles have sold over a billion records worldwide. For feats of sales and airplay alone, the Beatles are unquestionably the top group in rock and roll history. Yet their significance extends well beyond numbers to encompass their innovations in the recording studio. The Beatles’ legacy as a concert attraction, during their harried passage from nightclubs to baseball stadiums, is distinguished primarily by the deafening screams of female fans more overcome by their appearance than the music they played.   Consequently, the Beatles began to indulge their creative energies in the studio, layering sounds and crafting songs in a way that was experimental yet still accessible. This retreat from the ceaseless mayhem of pop celebrity yielded such musically expansive and lyrically sophisticated albums as Rubber Soul (1965) and Revolver (1966). The former, with its acoustic leanings and thoughtful lyrics, betrayed the influence of  Bob Dylan  upon the band, while the latter stands as a tour de force of tuneful, concise pop psychedelia.     The Beatles retired from touring for good after a San Francisco concert on August 29, 1966. Like Brian Wilson of  the Beach Boys , who abandoned touring to focus on his music, the Beatles thereafter became creatures of the studio. Ten months later, they released Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album that has almost universally been cited as the creative apotheosis of rock and roll, a watershed event in which rock became “serious art” without losing its sense of humor - or, in Lennon’s case, sense of the absurd. Realizing the band members’ collective ambitions took four months and all the technical wiles of producer  George Martin  could muster. A completely self-contained album meant to be played and experienced from start to finish, Sgt. Pepper broke the mold in that no singles were released.     The album’s artistic reach further cemented the notion of a viable counterculture in the minds of youthful dropouts everywhere. Anyone who was alive in the summer of 1967 can remember the pleasant shock of hearing it and the reverberations it sent outward into the world of rock and roll and beyond. As writer Langdon Winner observed, For a brief moment, the irreparably fractured consciousness of the West was unified, at least in the minds of the young. Sgt. Pepper was followed by perhaps the greatest two-sided single in rock history, “Strawberry Fields Forever” and “Penny Lane,” which exhibited the creative sensibilities of  John Lennon  and  Paul McCartney , respectively, at their zenith.      In the wake of Sgt. Pepper, the Beatles began to splinter in ways that were initially subtle but gradually grew more pronounced. Subsequent events included the death of manager Epstein due to an overdose of sleeping pills; the release of the TV film Magical Mystery Tour, which earned the Beatles some of their first negative reviews; a trip to India to meditate with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, about whom Lennon wrote “Sexy Sadie”; and the launching in January 1968 of Apple Corps, Ltd., a well-intentioned but ultimately mismanaged entertainment empire that helped bring down the Beatles.      Through all the chaotic events of the late Sixties, however, the Beatles retained their ingenuity and focus as recording artists. Released in August 1968, the single “Hey Jude""/""Revolution"" became their most popular single. The Beatles (1968), a double-LP popularly referred to as the White Album, found the group refracting into four estimably talented individuals. This 30-song tour de force included such Beatles classics as Back in the U.S.S.R, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Blackbird, Birthday, Helter Skelter and Revolution.     The album and film Let It Be, recorded in 1969 but shelved until 1970, documented the Beatles’ dissolution. Internal squabbles and the discomfiting presence of  John Lennon ’s new soulmate, Yoko Ono, revealed widening cracks within the group. Even in this tense atmosphere, the Beatles playfully harked back to their origins with impromptu performances of early rock and R&B classics in the studio.     The Beatles exited on a high note, coming together in the summer of 1969 to record a fitting swan song, Abbey Road. That album included numerous highlights: a playful pastiche of shorts songs, with  Paul McCartney  as chief instigator, on the second side; a pair of  John Lennon s most emotionally unguarded songs (""Come Together,” “Don’t Let Me Down""); and impressive contributions from  George Harrison  (""Here Comes the Sun,” “Something"").    On April 10, 1970,  Paul McCartney  announced his departure from the Beatles, and the group quietly came to an end. Throughout the Seventies, fans hoped for an eventual reunion, while the group members pursued solo careers with varying degrees of artistic and commercial success. Those hopes were dashed by the senseless murder of  John Lennon  in New York City on December 8, 1980.      The Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.  Paul McCartney  did not attend the ceremony, leaving surviving Beatles Harrison and Starr and Lennons widow, Yoko Ono, to be inducted by fellow British Invasion legend Mick Jagger, of  the Rolling Stones . McCartney released a brief statement that read: ‘’After 20 years, the Beatles still have some business differences which I had hoped would have been settled by now. Unfortunately, they haven’t been, so I would feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion.’’      In 1995, the three ex-Beatles regrouped harmoniously for The Beatles Anthology, which produced a six-hour video documentary aired over the course of three nights on ABC-TV; three double-disc anthologies of Beatles music, including much rare and unreleased material; and a massive coffee-table book with new and archival pictures and interviews. Yoko Ono provided home demos of two unreleased Lennon songs for the project, and McCartney, Harrison and Starr completed the recordings under the guiding hand of their longtime producer,  George Martin . This resulted in the first new Beatles singles in 25 years: Free as a Bird (#6) and Real Love (#11). It was the closest the group came to a reunion since their breakup in 1970.      One of the latest eruptions of Beatlemania occurred in 2005 with the release of 1, a single-disc collection of 27 songs that topped the American and/or British charts. In July 2006, LOVE  an elaborate Cirque de Soleil production that pays tribute to the Beatles - opened at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.      Though popular music has changed considerably in the decades since the Beatles demise, their music continues to reach and inspire new generations of listeners.

Some of the most well-known genres of American music are  blues ,  rock and roll ,  country ,  hip hop ,  jazz  and  gospel . American music history began with the  Native Americans , the first people to populate North America. The music of these people was highly varied in form, and was mostly religious in purpose.   With the arrival of large numbers of colonizers from European countries like France, Spain and Great Britain. These people brought  Christian   choirs ,  musical notation ,  broadsides , as well as large numbers of  West African   slaves . These  African Americans  played a variety of instruments, especially including  drums  and  string instruments  similar to the  guitar  and  banjo , as well as  polyrhythms  and  call-and-response  style vocals.   As the United States incorporated more lands, spreading west towards the Pacific Ocean, a number of immigrants began to arrive in the country, bringing with them their own instruments and styles. During this time, the United States grew to incorporate the  Cajun and Creole music  of  Louisiana , the  Polynesian   music of Hawaii  and  Tex-Mex and Tejano music . Immigrants brought with them the  Eastern European   polka ,  Chinese  and  Japanese  music,  Ukrainian  and Polish  fiddling ,  Scottish  and  Irish music ,  Ashkenazi   Jewish   klezmer , and other styles of  Indian ,  Russian ,  French ,  German ,  Italian ,  Arab  and  Latin music .   In the 20th century, American popular music has achieved great international acclaim. Even since the  ragtime  and  minstrel  songs of the 19th century,  African American music  has remained at the heart of American popular music. The rural  blues  of poor black Southerners and the  jazz  of black urbanites were among the earliest styles of American popular music. At the time, black performers typically did not perform their own material, instead using songs produced by the music publishing companies of  Tin Pan Alley . African American blues evolved during the 20th century, mixing with  Appalachian folk music  and other styles to create genres like  country music  and  rhythm and blues . During this time, jazz diversified into steadily more experimental fields. By the end of the 1940s, jazz had grown into such varied fields as  bebop  and  jazz .   Rock and roll was soon to become the most important component of American popular music, beginning with the  rockabilly  boom of the 1950s. In the following decade,  gospel  evolved into secular  soul . Rock, country and soul, mixed with each other and occasionally other styles, spawned a legion of subgenres over the next few days, ranging from  heavy metal  to  punk  and  funk . In the 1970s, urban African Americans in New York City began performing spoken lyrics over a beat provided by an  emcee ; this became known as  hip hop music . By the dawn of the 21st century, hip hop had become a part of most recorded American popular music.

Of these cultures, many, and their musical traditions, are now extinct, though some remain relatively vibrant in a modern form, such as  Hawaiian music .   By the 16th century, large-scale  immigration  of English, French and Spanish settlers brought new kinds of folk music. This was followed by the importation of Africans as  slaves , bringing their music with them. The Africans were as culturally varied as the Native Americans, descended from hundreds of ethnic groups in  West Africa . American music is, like most of its hemispheric neighbors, a mixture of African, European and native influences. Still later in the country's history, ethnic and musical diversity grew as the United States grew into a melting pot of different peoples. Immigration from China began in large numbers in the 19th century, most of them settling on the West Coast. Later, Japanese, Indian, Scottish, Polish, Italian, Irish, Mexican, Swedish,  Ukrainian  and  Armenian  immigrants also arrived in large numbers.     [ edit ]   African American music   Main article:  African American music   In the 19th century, African-Americans were freed from  slavery  following the  American Civil War . The music of these slaves was primarily African in origin, displaying  polyrhythm  and other distinctly African traits.  Work songs  and  field hollers  were popular, but it was  spirituals  which became a major foundation for music in the 20th century.   Spirituals (or  Negro spirituals , as they were then known) were Christian songs, dominated by passionate and earthy vocals, which were performed in an African-style  call-and-response  format using hymns derived from those sung in colonial New England choirs, which were based on Moravian, English and Dutch church music. These hymns spread south through  Appalachia  in the late 18th century, where they were partnered with the music of the African slaves. During the  Great Awakening  of religious fervor in the early 19th century, spirituals spread across the south. Among some whites, slave music grew increasingly popular, especially after the  American Civil War , when black and white soldiers worked together and Southern slaves fled north in huge numbers.   By the end of the century,  minstrel  shows had spread across the country, and even to continental Europe. In minstrel shows, performers imitated slaves in crude caricatures, singing and dancing to what was called ""Negro music"", though it had little in common with authentic African American folk styles. An African American variety of dance music called the  cakewalk  also became popular, evolving into  ragtime  by the turn of the century.     [ edit ]   Appalachian folk music   Main article:  Appalachian folk music   The  Appalachian Mountains  run along the East Coast of the United States. The region has long been historically poor compared to much of the rest of the country; many of the rural Appalachian people travelled to cities for work, and were there labeled  hillbillies , and their music became known as  hillbilly music . In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants arrived in large numbers. They mingled there with poor whites of other ethnic backgrounds, as well as many blacks. The result was a diverse array of folk styles which have been collectively referred to as  Appalachian folk music . These styles included  jug bands ,  honky tonk  and  bluegrass , and are the root of modern  country music .   Appalachian folk music began its evolution towards pop-country in 1927, when  Jimmie Rodgers  and the  Carter Family  began recording in a historic session with  Ralph Peer  (Barraclough and Wolff, 537). Rodgers sang often morbid lyrical themes that drew on the blues to create tales of the poor and unlucky (Collins, 11), while the Carters preferred more upbeat ballads with clear vocals, complementary instrumentation and wholesome lyrics (Garofalo, 53). Their success paved the way for the development of popular country, and left its mark on the developing genre of  rock and roll .     [ edit ]   Other forms of American roots music   Though Appalachian and African American folk music became the basis for most of American popular music, the United States is home to a diverse assortment of ethnic groups. In the early 20th century, many of these ethnic groups supported niche record industries and produced minor folk stars like  Pawlo Humeniuk , the ""King of the Ukrainian Fiddlers"" (Kochan and Kytasty, 308). Some of these ethnic musicians eventually became well-known across the country, such as  Frankie Yankovic , the  Slovenian   polka  master.   This same period also saw the rise of  Native American   powwows  around the turn of the century. These were large-scale inter-tribal events featuring spiritual activity and musical performances, mostly group percussion based (Means, 594).   Large-scale immigration of  Eastern European   Jews  and their  klezmer  music peaked in the first few decades of the 20th century. People like  Harry Kandel  and  Dave Tarras  become stars within their niche, and made the United States the international center for klezmer (Broughton, 583).   In  Texas , ethnic  Mexicans  who had lived in the area for centuries, played a distinct style of  conjunto , different from that played in Mexico. The influence of  Czech   polka  music was a major distinguishing characteristic of this music, which gradually evolved into what is now known as  norteo  (Burr, 604).   The  Cajuns  and  Creoles  of  Louisiana  have long constituted a distinct minority with their own cultural identity. The Cajuns are descendants of  French-Canadians  from the region of  Acadia , the Creoles are black and French-speaking. Their music was a mixture of bluesy work songs mixed with jazz and other influences, and included styles like  la la  and  jur . Though these genres were geographically limited, they were modernized and mixed with more mainstream styles, evolving into popular  zydeco  music by the middle of the century (Broughton and Kaliss, 558).     [ edit ]   Popular music   Main article:  American popular music   The first field of American music that could be viewed as  popular , rather than  classical  or  folk , was the singing of the colonial New England choirs, and travelling singing masters like  William Billings . It was here that techniques and traditions like  shape note ,  lined-out hymnody  and  Sacred Harp  were created, gradually spreading south and becoming an integral part of the  Great Awakening . The Great Awakening was a period of religious fervor, among whites and blacks (both slave and free), that saw passionate, evangelical "" Negro spirituals "" grow in popularity (Ferris, 98).   During the 19th century, it was not spirituals that gained truly widespread acclaim, but rather peppy comic songs performed by  minstrels  in  blackface , and written by legendary songwriters like  Stephen Foster  and  Daniel Emmett . During the Civil War, popular ballads were common, some used liberally by both the North and the South as patriotic songs. Finally, late in the century, the African American  cakewalk  evolved into  ragtime , which became a North American and European sensation, while mainstream America was enthralled by the brass band marches of  John Philips Sousa .   Tin Pan Alley  was the biggest source of  popular music  early in the 20th century (Garofolo, 17). Tin Pan Alley was a place in New York City which published  sheet music  for dance songs like ""After the Ball Is Over"". The first few decades of the 20th century also saw the rise of popular, comic  musical theater , such as the  vaudeville  tradition and composers and writers like  Oscar Hammerstein II ,  Jerome Kern  and  Ira Gershwin . At the same time,  jazz  and  blues , two distinct but related genres, began flourishing in cities like Chicago and  New Orleans  and began to attract some mainstream audiences.   Blues and jazz were the foundation of what became American popular music. The ability to sell recorded music through  phonographs  changed the music industry into one that relied on the charisma of star performers rather than songwriters. There was increased pressure to record bigger hits, meaning that even minor trends and fads like Hawaiian  steel guitar  left a permanent influence (the steel guitar is still very common in  country music ).  Dominican   merengue  and  Argentinian   tango  also left their mark, especially on jazz, which has long been a part of the music scene in Latin America. During the 1920s,  classic female blues  singers like  Mamie Smith  became the first musical celebrities of national renown.  Gospel , blues and jazz were also diversifying during this period, with new subgenres evolving in different cities like New York, New Orleans and Chicago.           Billie Holiday , a popular jazz singer       Jazz quickly replaced the blues as American popular music, in the form of  big band   swing , a kind of  dance music  from the early 1930s. Swing used large ensembles, and was not generally improvised, in contrast with the free-flowing form of other kinds of jazz. With swing spreading across the nation, other genres continued to evolve towards popular traditions. In Louisiana,  Cajun and Creole music  was adding influences from  blues  and generating some regional hit records, while  Appalachian folk music  was spawning  jug bands ,  honky tonk  bars and  close harmony duets , which were to evolve into the pop-folk of the 1940s, bluegrass and country.     [ edit ]   1940s and 1950s   Main article:  Music of the United States (1940s and 50s)   In the 1940s, blues became the basis for  rock and roll , while jazz evolved into an ever more experimental  bebop  scene. Country and folk music further developed as well, gaining newfound popularity and acclaim for hard-edged  folk music . Perhaps most importantly, the 1940s saw the rise of the youth culture. Teenagers from across the country began to identify with each other and launched numerous trends. The first  teen stars  arose, beginning with the  bobby soxer  idol  Frank Sinatra ; this opened up new audiences for popular music, which had been primarily an adult phenomenon prior to the 40s.     [ edit ]   Roots of country music   Main article:  Country music   The early 1940s saw the first major commercial success for Appalachian folk. Singers like  Pete Seeger  emerged, in groups like the  Almanac Singers  and  The Weavers . Lyrically, these performers drew on early  singer-songwriters  like  Woody Guthrie , and the whole scene became gradually associated with the political left (Garofolo, 196). By the 1950s, the anti-Communism scare was in full swing, and some performers with a liberal or  socialist  bent were blacklisted from the music industry.   In the middle of the 40s,  Western swing  reached its peak of popularity. It was a mixture of diverse influences, including  swing ,  blues ,  polka  and popular  cowboy  songs, and included early stars like  Bob Wills , who became among the best known musicians of the era.   With a honky tonk root, modern  country music  arose in the 1940s, mixing with  R&B  and the blues to form  rockabilly . Rockabilly's earliest stars were  Elvis Presley  and  Bill Haley , who entertained to crowds of devoted teenage fans. At the time, black audiences were listening to R&B, doo wop and gospel, but these styles were not perceived as appropriate for white listeners. People like Haley and Presley were white, but sang in a black style. This caused a great deal of controversy from concerned parents who felt that ""race music"", as it was then known, would corrupt their children. Nevertheless, rockabilly's popularity continued to grow, paving the way for the earliest rock stars like  Chuck Berry ,  Bo Diddley ,  Little Richard  and  Fats Domino .   Among country fans, rockabilly was not well-regarded. Instead, the pop sounds of singers like  Hank Williams  and  Patsy Cline  became popular. Williams had an unprecedented run of success, with more than ten chart-topping singles in two years (1950-1951), including well-remembered songs still performed today like "" I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry "" and "" Cold, Cold Heart "". It was performers like Williams that established the city of  Nashville, Tennessee  as the center of the country music industry. There, country and pop were mixed, resulting in what was known as the  Nashville Sound .     [ edit ]   Gospel and doo wop   Main articles:  Gospel  and  doo wop   The 1950s also saw the widespread popularization of  gospel music , in the form of powerful singers like  Mahalia Jackson . Gospel first broke into international audiences in 1948, with the release of Jackson's ""Move On Up a Little Higher"", which was so popular it couldn't be shipped to record stores fast enough. As the music became more mainstream in the later part of the decade, performers began adding influences from  R&B  to make a more palatable and dance-able sound. Early in the next decade, the lyrics were secularized, resulting in  soul music . Some of soul's biggest stars began performing in the 50s gospel scene, including  Sam Cooke ,  Dinah Washington ,  Dionne Warwick  and  Aretha Franklin .   Doo wop , a complex type of vocal music, also became popular during the 1950s, and left its mark on 1960s soul and R&B. The genre's exact origins are debatable, but it drew on groups like the  Mills Brothers  and  The Ink Spots , who played a kind of R&B with smooth, alternating lead vocals. With the addition of gospel inflections, doo wop's polished sound and romantic ballads made it a major part of the 50s music scene, beginning in 1951. The first popular groups were  The Five Keys  (""Glory Of Love"") and  The Flamingos  (""Golden Teardrops""). Doo wop diversified considerably later in the decade, with groups like  The Crows  (""Gee""), creating a style of  uptempo doo wop  and the ballad style via  The Penguins  (""Earth Angel""), while singers like  Frankie Lymon  became sensations; Lymon became the first black teen idol in the country's history after the release of the Top 40 pop hit ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"" (1956).     [ edit ]   Latin music   Main articles:  Latin music in the United States   Latin music imported from  Cuba  ( chachach ,  mambo ,  rumba ) and Mexico ( ranchera  and  mariachi ) had brief periods of popularity during the 50s. The earliest popular Latin music in the United States came with rumba in the early 1930s, and was followed by  calypso  in the mid-40s, mambo in the late 40s and early 50s, chachach and  charanga  in the mid-50s,  bolero  in the late 50s and finally  boogaloo  in the mid-60s, while Latin music mixed with jazz during the same period, resulting in  Latin jazz  and the  bossa nova  fusion  cool jazz .   The first Mexican-Texan pop star was  Lydia Mendoza , who began recording in 1934. It was not until the 40s, however, that  musica nortea  became popularized by female duets like  Carmen y Laura  and  Las Hermanas Mendoza , who had a string of regional hits. The following decade saw the rise of  Chelo Silva , known as the ""Queen of the (Mexican)  Bolero "", who sang romantic pop songs.   The 50s saw further innovation in the Mexican-Texan community, as electric guitars, drums and elements of rock and jazz were added to  conjunto .  Valeria Longoria  was the first major performer of conjunto, known for introducing Colombian  cumbia  and Mexican  ranchera  to conjunto bands. Later,  Tony de la Rosa  modernized the conjunto big bands by adding electric guitars, amplified  bajo sexto  and a drum kit and slowing down the frenetic dance rhythms of the style. In the mid-1950s, bandleader  Isidro Lopez  used accordion in his band, thus beginning the evolution of  Tejano music . The rock-influenced  Little Joe  was the first major star of this scene.     [ edit ]   Cajun and Creole music   Main article:  Music of Louisiana   Louisiana's Cajun and Creole communities saw their local music become a brief mainstream fad during the 1950s. This was largely due to the work of  Clifton Chenier , who began recording for  Speciality Records  in 1955. He took authentic Cajun and Creole music and added more elements of rock and roll: a rollicking beat, frenetic vocals and a dance-able rhythm; the result was a style called  zydeco . Chenier continued recording for more than thirty years, releasing over a hundred albums and paving the way for later stars like  Boozoo Chavis  and  Buckwheat Zydeco .     [ edit ]   1960s and 70s   Main article:  Music of the United States (1960s and 70s)   In the 1960s, music became heavily involved in the burgeoning youth  counter culture , as well as various social and political causes. The beginning of the decade saw the peak of doo wop's popularity, in about 1961, as well as the rise of  surf ,  girl groups  and the first  soul  singers.  Psychedelic  and  progressive rock  arose during this period, along with the roots of what would later become  funk ,  hip hop ,  salsa ,  electronic music ,  punk rock  and  heavy metal . An American  roots revival  occurred simultaneously as a period of sexual liberation and racial conflict, leading to growth in the lyrical maturity and complexity of popular music as songwriters wrote about the changes the country was going through.     [ edit ]   Early 1960s   The first few years of the 1960s saw major innovation in  popular music .  Girl groups ,  surf  and  hot rod , and the  Nashville Sound  were popular, while an Appalachian folk and African American blues  roots revival  became dominant among a smaller portion of the listening audience. An even larger population of young audiences in the United Kingdom listened to American blues. By the middle of the decade,  British blues  and  R&B  bands like  The Beatles ,  The Who  and the  Rolling Stones  were topping the charts in what became known as the  British Invasion , alongside newly-secularized  soul music  and the mainstreaming of the  Bakersfield Sound . Folk-based  singer-songwriters  like  Bob Dylan  also added new innovations to popular music, expanding its possibilities, such as by making singles more than the standard three minutes in length.     [ edit ]   Psychedelic rock   Main article:  Psychedelic rock   Psychedelic rock became the genre most closely intertwined with the youth culture. It arose from the British Invasion of blues in the middle of the decade, when bands like  The Beatles ,  Rolling Stones  and  The Who  dominated the charts and only a few American bands, such as  The Beach Boys  and  The Mamas & the Papas , could compete. It became associated with  hippies  and the anti-war movement, civil rights, feminism and environmentalism, paralleling the similar rise of  Afrocentric   Black Power  in  soul  and  funk . Events like  Woodstock  became defining symbols for the generation known as the  Baby Boomers , who were born immediately following World War 2 and came of age in the mid to late 60s.   Later in the decade, psychedelic rock and the youth culture splintered.  Punk rock ,  heavy metal ,  singer-songwriter  and  progressive rock  appeared, and the connection between music and social activism largely disappeared from popular music.     [ edit ]   Soul and funk   Main articles:  Soul  and  funk   In the middle of the decade, female soul singers like  Dionne Warwick ,  Aretha Franklin  and  Diana Ross  were popular, while innovative performers like  James Brown  invented a new style of soul called  funk . Influenced by psychedelic rock, which was dominating the charts at the time, funk was a very rhythmic, dance-able kind of soul. Later in the decade and into the 70s, funk too split into two strands.  Sly & the Family Stone  made pop-funk palatable for the masses, while  George Clinton  and his  P Funk  collective pioneered a new, psychedelia- and heavy metal-influenced form of avant-garde funk.  Album-oriented soul  also appeared very late in the decade and into the next, with artists like  Marvin Gaye ,  Al Green  and  Curtis Mayfield  taking soul beyond the realm of the single into cohesive album-length artistic statements with a complex social conscience.   It was in this context, of album-oriented soul and funk, influenced by  Black Power  and the civil rights movement, that African Americans in  Harlem  invented  hip hop music .     [ edit ]   Country and folk   Main articles:  Country  and  folk music   Merle Haggard  led the rise of the  Bakersfield Sound  in the 60s, when the perceived superficiality of the Nashville Sound led to a national wave that almost entirely switched country music's capital and sound within the space of a few years. At the same time, bluegrass became a major influence on  jam bands  like  Grateful Dead  and also evolved into new, progressive genres like  newgrass . As part of the nationwide  roots revival , Hawaiian  slack-key guitar  and  Cajun   swamp pop  also saw mainstream success.     [ edit ]   Tejano   Main article:  Tejano music   With the widespread success of  Tony de la Rosa 's big band  conjunto  in the late 1950s, the style became more influenced by rock and pop.  Esteban Jordan 's wild, improvised style of accordion became popular, paving the way for the further success of  El Conjunto Bernal . The Bernal brothers' band sold thousands of albums and used faster rhythms than before.     [ edit ]   1970s   The early 1970s saw popular music being dominated by folk-based  singer-songwriters  like  John Denver ,  Carole King  and  James Taylor , followed by the rise of  heavy metal  subgenres,  glam ,  country rock  and later,  disco .  Philly soul  and pop-funk was also popular, while  world music  fusions became more commonplace and a major  klezmer  revival occurred among the Jewish community. Beginning in the early 70s,  hip hop  arose in New York City, drawing on diverse influences from both white and black folk music, Jamaican  toasting  and the performance poetry of  Gil Scott-Heron .     [ edit ]   Heavy metal   Main article:  Heavy metal music   Heavy metal 's early pioneers included the British bands  Led Zeppelin  and  Black Sabbath , though American cult bands  Blue Cheer  and  The Velvet Underground  also played a major role. Their music was hard-edged and bluesy, with an often menacing tone that became more pronounced in later subgenres. In the beginning of the 70s, heavy metal-influenced  glam rock  arose, and musicians like  David Bowie  became famous for gender-bending costumes and themes. Glam was followed by mainstream bombastic  arena rock  and light  progressive rock  bands becoming mainstream, with bands like  Styx  and  Chicago  launching popular careers that lasted most of the decade.  Glam metal , a glitzy form of  Los Angeles  metal, also found a niche audience but limited mainstream success.     [ edit ]   Outlaw country   Main article:  Outlaw country   With the Bakersfield Sound the dominant influence, outlaw country singers like  Willie Nelson  and  Waylon Jennings  were the biggest country stars of the 70s, alongside  country rock  bands like  Lynyrd Skynyrd  and  Allman Brothers Band  who were more oriented towards crossover audiences. Later in the decade and into the next, these both mixed with other genres in the form of  heartland rockers  like  Bruce Springsteen , while a  honky tonk  revival hit the country charts, led by  Dwight Yoakam .     [ edit ]   Hip hop   Main article:  Hip hop music   Hip hop was a cultural movement that began in  Harlem  in the early 1970s, consisting of four elements. Two of them,  rapping  and  DJing , make up  hip hop music . These two elements were imported from Jamaica by  DJ Kool Herc . At neighborhood  block parties , DJs would spin popular records while the audience danced. Soon, an  MC  arose to lead the proceedings, as the DJ began isolating and repeating the  percussion breaks  (the most popular, dance-able part). MCs' introductions became more and more complex, drawing on numerous African-derived vocal traditions, and became the foundation of  rapping . By the end of the decade, hip hop had spread across the country, especially in  Los Angeles  and Chicago.     [ edit ]   Salsa   Main article:  Salsa music   Cuban and Puerto Ricans in New York invented salsa in the early 1970s, using multiple sources from Latin America in the pan-Latin melting pot of the city. Puerto Rican  plena  and  bomba  and Cuban  chachacha ,  son montuno  and  mambo  were the biggest influences, alongside  Jamaican , Mexican,  Dominican ,  Trinidadian ,  Argentinian ,  Colombian  and  Brazilian  sources. Many of the earliest salsa musicians, like  Tito Puente , had had a long career in various styles of Latin music. Salsa grew very popular in the 70s and into the next two decades, spreading south to Venezuela, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Peru and especially Cuba.     [ edit ]   Punk rock   Main article:  Punk rock   Punk rock arose as a reaction against what had come before. Early punks believed that hollow greed had destroyed American music, and hated the perceived bombasity and arrogance of the biggest bands of the 1970s. It arose in London and New York, with numerous regional centers by the end of the decade when acts like  Ramones  and  Patti Smith  saw unprecedented success for their defiantly anti-mainstream genre. It was the British band  The Clash , however, that became wildly popular, more so in the UK than the U.S., and set the stage for adoption of elements of punk in popular music in the 80s.     [ edit ]   1980s and 90s   Main article:  Music of the United States (1980s to the present)   The 1980s began with  New Wave  dominating the charts, and continued through a new form of silky smooth soul, and ended with a popular  glam metal  trend dominating mainstream America. Meanwhile, the first glimmer of punk rock's popularity began, and new  alternative rock  and  hardcore  found niche markets. Hip hop diversified as a few artists gained mainstream success, finally breaking through in the last few months of the decade.     [ edit ]   Hip hop   Main article:  Hip hop music   In the 1980s, hip hop saw its first taste of mainstream success with  LL Cool J  and  Kurtis Blow . Meanwhile, hip hop was continuing its spread from the East Coast to most major urban areas across the country, and abroad. At the end of the decade, two albums broke the genre into the mainstream.  Public Enemy 's  It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back  and  N.W.A. 's  Straight Outta Compton  broke through with highly controversial and sometimes violent lyrics. N.W.A. proved especially important, launching the career of  Dr. Dre  and the dominant  West Coast rap  sound of the next decade. That same year (1989),  De La Soul 's  3 Feet High and Rising  became the earliest release of  alternative hip hop , and numerous regional styles of hip hop saw their first legitimatization, including Chicago  hip house , Los Angeles  electroclash ,  Miami 's  bass ,  Washington D.C. 's  go go  and  Detroit 's  ghettotech .     [ edit ]   1990s   As the 90s began, hair metal was dominating the charts, especially formulaic bands like  Extreme . In reaction to that, the first few years saw a sea change in American popular music.  Nirvana 's  Nevermind  along with Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden launched the defiantly anti-mainstream  grunge  movement among mainstream audiences, while  Dr. Dre 's  The Chronic  brought his West Coast  G Funk  sound to widespread success.   Both these trends died out quickly, however, grunge done in by  Kurt Cobain 's death and disillusionisment with grunge, a form of  alternative  rock, becoming mainstream. G Funk lasted a few years, displacing  East Coast rap  as the dominant sound of hip hop. A rivalry began, fed by the music news, focusing on West Coast's  Tupac Shakur  and the East Coast's  Notorious B.I.G. . By the middle of the decade, Tupac and Biggie were shot dead, and Dr Dre's  Death Row Records  had fallen apart. East Coast rappers like  Puff Daddy  and  Busta Rhymes  re-established the East Coast, while  Atlanta 's  OutKast  and other performers found a mainstream audience.   Alanis Morissette , one of the top-selling artist of the 90s, injected renewed popularity to singer-songwriters such as  Tori Amos ,  Jewel , and  Sarah MacLachlan . In the wake of grunge and gangsta rap came a fusion of soul and hip hop, called  nu soul , some popularity for British  Britpop  and the rise of bands like  Sublime  and  No Doubt , playing a form of pop punk influenced by Jamaican  ska  and British  two tone  ska/punk fusionists from the early 80s.  Techno  also became popular, though nowhere's near as much so as in most of the rest of the world.   At the turn of the millennium,  bubblegum pop  groups like  Backstreet Boys  and  Britney Spears  were dominating the charts, many of them with a Latin beat ( Shakira ,  Ricky Martin ), and rappers like  Jay-Z  and  Eminem  were huge stars. Some  garage rock  revivalists like  The White Stripes  and  The Hives  became highly-hyped bands in the  indie rock  field, and achieved substantial mainstream success. The first few years of the 2000s saw the further rise of pop-hip hop, fed by the breakthrough success of Eminem. Indeed, hip hop became an essential element of nearly all popular music during this period, resulting in new fusions like  nu metal . Pop thug rappers like  Ja Rule  were nationally renowned, though hard-edged hip made a return within a few years with the rise of  50 Cent .                 v      d      e     History of the United States             Timeline     Pre-Columbian      Colonial      17761789      17891849      18491865      18651918      19181945      19451964      19641980      19801991      1991present               Topics     African American      Diplomatic      Economic      Expansion (continental)      Expansion (overseas)      Immigration      Technological and industrial      Jewish      Maritime      Military      Musical      Stamps      Religious      Southern      Women               Category     Portal                     Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_history_of_the_United_States ""      Categories :  American music history  |  American music                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                                                   This page was last modified on 21 February 2009, at 20:35.

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters.

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

clueweb09-enwp02-05-02572	"                     Disc jockey          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          ""DJ"" redirects here. For other uses, see  DJ (disambiguation) .   A  disc jockey  (also known as  DJ  or  deejay ) is a person who selects and plays  recorded music  for an audience. Originally, dis k  referred to  phonograph  records, while dis c  refers to the  Compact Disc , and has become the more common spelling.   A  video jockey  or VJ serves the same function for  music videos .   There are several types of disc jockeys. Radio DJs introduce and play music that is broadcast on  AM ,  FM ,  shortwave ,  digital , or  internet radio  stations. Club DJs select and play music in  bars ,  nightclubs ,  discothques , at  raves , or even in a  stadium .  Hip-hop  disc jockeys select and play music using multiple  turntables , often to backup one or more  MCs . In  reggae , the disc jockey ( deejay ) is a vocalist who  raps , "" toasts "", or chats over pre-recorded rhythm tracks while the individual choosing and playing them is referred to as a  selector . [ 1 ]  Mobile disc jockeys travel with portable sound systems and work at a variety of events.

DJ equipment may consist of:     Sound recordings in a DJ's preferred medium (e.g.,  vinyl records , Compact Discs, computer media files, etc.);   A combination of two devices (or sometimes one, if playback is digital) to play sound recordings, for alternating back and forth to create a continuous playback of music (e.g., record players, Compact Disc players, computer media players such as an  MP3  player, etc.);   A  sound system  for amplification or broadcasting of the recordings (e.g., portable audio system,  PA system ) or a radio broadcasting system;   A  DJ mixer , which is an electronic (usually 2- or 4-channel)  audio mixer  with a  crossfader  used to smoothly go from one song to another, using two or more playback devices;   Headphones , used to listen to one recording while the other recording is being played to the audience; and   Optionally, a  microphone , so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience.     Other equipment could or can be added to the basic DJ setup (above), providing unique sound manipulations. Such devices include, but are not limited to:     Electronic  effects units  ( delay ,  reverb ,  octave ,  equalizer ,  chorus , etc.). Some club DJs use a sub-harmonic synthesizer effect which either doubles low frequencies with energy added an octave lower or synthesizes harmonics such that the impression of a very low bass sound is added to the mix.   A computerised performance system, which can be used with  vinyl emulation software  to manipulate digital files on the computer in real time.   Multi-stylus headshells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.   Special  DJ digital controller  hardware can manipulate digital files on a PC or laptop;   Samplers , sequencers, electronic musical keyboards (synthesizers), or  drum machines .     Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the  cuing ,  equalization , and  audio mixing  of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques.   Club DJ turntable techniques include  beatmatching ,  phrasing , and  slip-cueing  to preserve energy on a dancefloor.  Turntablism  embodies the art of  cutting ,  beat juggling ,  scratching ,  needle drops ,  phase shifting ,  back spinning , and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of  samples  in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a  musical instrument  rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use  harmonic mixing  to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.     [ edit ]   Types   The role of selecting and playing  recorded music  for an intended audience is the same for every disc jockey. The selected music, the audience, the setting, the preferred medium, and the level of sophistication of sound manipulation are factors that differentiate the various DJ types.     [ edit ]   Radio disc jockeys           Armed Forces Vietnam Network  disc jockey SP4 Tim Abney broadcasts for  The Big Red One  at radio KLIK in Lai Khe, 1967. [ 2 ]           Main article:  Radio personality       A radio disc jockey plays music that is broadcast across radio wavesAM and FM bands, or worldwide on shortwave radio stations. Radio DJs are often notable for their personalities.   Famous American radio disc jockeys such as  Alan Freed ,  Scott Muni ,  Casey Kasem ,  Dick Biondi ,  Wolfman Jack , and  Dr. Demento  built their audiences using a combination of the nature of the songs they selected and strong on-air personalities. A modern-day  commercial radio  disc jockey will typically rely on his or her on-air character alone, as the station's playlist has been predetermined by a program director or music director.   Radio disc jockeys appear in a wide range of  broadcast formats , from  top 40  or  contemporary hit radio  (CHR) to  oldies  and other formats that are defined by the type of songs played. Formats are defined by the type of originating station, with  public radio ,  college radio , and  pirate radio  as examples. Some national governments operate official radio stations for a global audience, such as  Voice of America  (hosted by the United States) and  Voice of Russia  (organized by the Russian government). These stations may include programs by disc jockeys;  The Clash  frontman  Joe Strummer  played selections from his musical library for the UK's  BBC World Service  in the 1990s. Large military units sometimes broadcast their own radio programs to their troops, inserting news, weather reports, and advice between popular songs. The film  Good Morning, Vietnam  portrays an American military disc jockey.     [ edit ]   Reggae deejays   In  reggae  music (specifically  dancehall ), the deejay is traditionally a  vocalist  who raps,  toasts , or chats to a "" riddim ."" The term ""selector"" is reserved for the person who just selects the record and plays it over the sound system.     [ edit ]   Club disc jockeys           Darude  performing at The Docks, Toronto, 2007.       Using several turntables, CD players, or a hard-drive source, a club disc jockey selects and plays music in a club setting. The setting can range anywhere from a neighborhood party or a small nightclub to a discotheque, a rave, or even a stadium. The main focus of club DJs is on the music they play and how they mix tracks in and out, sometimes just to add a bit of energy to a track. They build their  sets  by choosing tracks to control the energy level of the crowd and use  beatmixing  and beatmatching techniques for seamless transitions between tracks. For more information, see  List of club DJs .     [ edit ]   Hip-hop disc jockeys     See also:  Turntablism     A  hip-hop  disc jockey is a DJ that selects and plays music as a hip-hop artist and/or performer, often backing up one or more  MCs .     [ edit ]   Mobile disc jockeys       Main article:  Mobile disc jockey              A mobile DJ.       Mobile disc jockeys  are an extension of the original  radio  disc jockeys. They travel with or go on tour with mobile sound systems and play from an extensive collection of recorded content for a specific audience. Today, mobile DJs need a large selection of music, professional-grade equipment, good organizational skills, vocal talent as an  MC , mixing skills, quality lighting, insurance for liability, and on-site backup equipment. [ 3 ]  In the 2000s, the role of the mobile DJ has expanded. Many mobile DJs have assumed additional responsibilities to ensure an event's success. These responsibilities include the roles of MC, event organizer and coordinator, lighting director, and/or sound engineer. [ 4 ]   In the past, Mobile DJs utilized vinyl records or cassettes. During the  disco  era of the 1970s, demand for mobile DJs (called ""mobile discos"" in the UK) soared, and top disc jockeys travelled with hundreds of vinyl records and  cassette tapes . [ 3 ]  In the 1990s, Compact Discs became the standard.  Mobile disc jockey  trade publications such as  DJ Times  magazine and  Mobile Beat  were founded in this era. [ 4 ]  Mobile DJs have formed professional associations such as the  Canadian Disc Jockey Association  (CDJA), the  Canadian Online Disc Jockey Association  (CODJA), the  American Disc Jockey Association  (ADJA), and the  National Association of Mobile Entertainers . [ 4 ]  In the UK, associations include the  National Association of Disc Jockeys  (NADJ) and the South Eastern Discotheque Association (SEDA).   Today, many mobile DJs rely heavily on laptop computers and MP3s for sequencing and mixing. [ 5 ]  This technology allows DJs to do mixing prior to an event and also lightens the load by reducing the number of CDs that a DJ must carry.     [ edit ]   Timeline     [ edit ]   19th century to 1920s   In 1857,  Leon Scott  invented the  phonoautograph  in  France , the first device to record sound. In 1877,  Charles Cros  invented the phonograph in France (it was patented before Edison's invention but never built) and  Thomas Alva Edison  invented the  phonograph cylinder , the first device to play back recorded sound, in the  United States . In 1892,  Emile Berliner  began commercial production of his gramophone records, the first disc records to be offered to the public. In 1906,  Reginald Fessenden  transmitted the first audio radio  broadcast  in history also playing the first record, that of a  contralto  singing  Handel's   Largo  from  Xerxes . [ 6 ]   The world's first radio disc jockey was Ray Newby, of Stockton, California. In 1909, at 16 years of age, Newby began regularly playing records on a small  spark transmitter  while a student at Herrold College of Engineering and Wireless, located in San Jose, California, under the authority of radio pioneer  Charles ""Doc"" Herrold . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]       We used popular records at that time, mainly Caruso records, because they were very good and loud; we needed a boost we started on an experimental basis and then, because this is novel, we stayed on schedule continually without leaving the air at any time from that time on except for a very short time during World War I, when the government required us to remove the antenna Most of our programming was records, I'll admit, but of course we gave out news as we could obtain it [ 7 ]      Ray Newby,  I've Got a Secret  (1965)     By 1910, regular radio broadcasting had started to use ""live"" as well as prerecorded sound. In the early radio age, content typically included comedy, drama, news, music, and sports reporting. The on-air announcers and programmers would later be known as disc jockeys. In the 1920s,  juke joints  became popular as places for dancing and drinking to recorded jukebox music. In 1927,  Christopher Stone  became the first radio announcer and programmer in the  United Kingdom , on the  BBC  radio station. In 1929, Thomas Edison ceased phonograph cylinder manufacture, ending the disc and cylinder rivalry.     [ edit ]   1930s1950s   In 1935, American commentator  Walter Winchell  coined the term ""disc jockey"" (the combination of ""disc"" (referring to the disc records) and ""jockey"" (which is an operator of a machine) as a description of radio announcer  Martin Block , the first announcer to become a star. While his audience was awaiting developments in the  Lindbergh kidnapping , Block played records and created the illusion that he was broadcasting from a ballroom, with the nations top dance bands performing live. The show, which he called  Make Believe Ballroom , was an instant hit. The term ""disc jockey"" appeared in print in  Variety  in 1941. [ 9 ]   In 1943,  Jimmy Savile  launched the world's first DJ dance party by playing  jazz  records in the upstairs function room of the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds in  Otley ,  England . In 1947, he became the first DJ to use twin turntables for continuous play. Also in 1947, the Whiskey  Go-Go nightclub opened in  Paris, France , considered to be the world's first discothque, or disco (deriving its name from the French word meaning a nightclub where the featured entertainment is recorded music rather than an on-stage band). Discos began appearing across Europe and the United States. From the late 1940s to early 1950s, the introduction of television eroded the popularity of radio's early format, causing it to take on the general form it has today, with a strong focus on music, news, and sports.   In the 1950s, American radio DJs would appear live at ""sock hops"" and ""platter parties"" and assume the role of a human jukebox. They would usually play 45-rpm records, featuring hit singles on one turntable while talking between songs. In some cases, a live drummer was hired to play beats between songs to maintain the dance floor. In 1955,  Bob Casey , a well-known ""sock hop"" DJ, introduced the first two-turntable system for alternating back and forth between records, creating a continuous playback of music. Throughout the 1950s,  payola  payments by record companies to DJs in return for airplay were an ongoing problem. Part of the fallout from the payola scandal was tighter control of the music by station management. The  Top 40  format emerged, where popular songs are played repeatedly.   In the late 1950s,  sound systems , a new form of public entertainment, were developed in the  ghettos  of  Kingston, Jamaica . Promoters, who called themselves DJs, would throw large parties in the streets that centered on the disc jockey, called the ""selector,"" who played dance music from large, loud  PA systems  and bantered over the music with a boastful, rhythmic chanting style called "" toasting ."" These parties quickly became profitable for the promoters, who would sell admission, food, and alcohol, leading to fierce competition between DJs for the biggest sound systems and newest records.     [ edit ]   1960s and 1970s          Captain PJ performing at Spectra in 1977.       In the mid-1960s, nightclubs and discotheques continued to grow in Europe and the United States. Specialized DJ equipment, such as  Rudy Bozak 's classic CMA-10-2DL mixer, began to appear on the market. In 1969, American club DJ  Francis Grasso  popularized beatmatching at  New York 's Sanctuary nightclub. Beatmatching is the technique of creating seamless transitions between records with  matching   beats , or tempos. Grasso also developed  slip-cuing , the technique of holding a record still while the turntable is revolving underneath, releasing it at the desired moment to create a sudden transition from the previous record.   By 1968, the number of dance clubs started to decline; most American clubs either closed or were transformed into clubs featuring live bands. Neighborhood block parties that were modelled after Jamaican sound systems gained popularity in Europe and in the  boroughs  of  New York City .   During the early 1970s, the economic downturn led most of the dance clubs to become underground  gay  discos. In 1973,  Jamaican-born   DJ Kool Herc , widely regarded as the ""godfather of hip-hop culture,"" performed at block parties in his  Bronx  neighborhood and developed a technique of mixing back and forth between two identical records to extend the rhythmic instrumental segment, or  break . Turntablism, the art of using turntables not only to play music but to manipulate sound and create original music, began to develop.   In 1974,  Technics  released the first  SL-1200  turntable, which evolved into the SL-1200 MK2 in 1979which, as of the mid-2000s, remains the industry standard for deejaying. In 1974, German  electronic music  band  Kraftwerk  released the 22-minute song ""Autobahn,"" which takes up the entire first side of that LP. Years later, Kraftwerk would become a significant influence on  hip-hop  artists such as  Afrika Bambaataa  and  house music  pioneer  Frankie Knuckles . During the mid-1970s,  Hip-hop music  and culture began to emerge, originating among urban  African Americans  and  Latinos  in New York City. The four main elements of  hip-hop culture  were  MCing (rapping) , DJing,  graffiti , and  breakdancing .   In the mid-1970s, the soul-funk blend of dance pop known as disco took off in the mainstream pop charts in the  United States  and Europe, causing discotheques to experience a rebirth. Unlike many late-1960s clubs, which featured live bands, discotheques used the DJ's selection and mixing of records as the entertainment. In 1975,  record pools  began, providing disc jockeys access to newer music from the industry in an efficient method.   In 1976, American DJ, editor, and producer  Walter Gibbons  remixed ""Ten Percent"" by  Double Exposure , one of the earliest commercially released 12 singles (aka ""maxi-single""). In 1977, hip-hop DJ  Grand Wizard Theodore  invented the scratching technique by accident. In 1979, the  Sugar Hill Gang  released "" Rapper's Delight ,"" the first hip-hop record to become a hit. It was also the first real breakthrough for  sampling , as the bassline of  Chic 's "" Good Times "" laid the foundation for the song.   In 1977,  Saratoga Springs, NY  disc jockey Tom L. Lewis introduced the Disco Bible (later renamed Disco Beats), which published hit disco songs listed by beats per minute (tempo), as well as by either artist or song title. Billboard ran an article on the new publication, and it went national relatively quickly. The list made it easier for beginning DJs to learn how to create seamless transitions between songs without dancers having to change their rhythm on the dance floor.     [ edit ]   1980s   In 1981, the cable television network  MTV  was launched, originally devoted to music videos, especially popular rock music. The term "" video jockey ,"" or VJ, was used to describe the fresh-faced youth who introduced the music videos. In 1982, the demise of disco in the mainstream by the summer of 1982 forced many nightclubs to either close or change entertainment styles, such as by providing MTV-style video dancing or live bands. Released in 1982, the song ""Planet Rock"" by DJ  Afrika Bambaataa  was the first hip-hop song to feature  synthesizers . The song melded electronic hip-hop beats with the melody from Kraftwerk's ""Trans-Europe Express."" In 1982, the Compact Disc reached the public market in Asia, and early the following year in other markets. This event is often seen as the ""Big Bang"" of the  digital audio  revolution.   In the early 1980s, NYC disco DJ  Larry Levan , known for his eclectic mixes, gained a cult following, and the  Paradise Garage , the nightclub at which he spun, became the prototype for the modern dance club where the music and the DJ were showcased. Around the same time, the disco-influenced electronic style of dance music called  house music  emerged in Chicago. The name was derived from the  Warehouse Club  in  Chicago , where resident DJ  Frankie Knuckles  mixed old disco classics and Eurosynth pop. House music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a  drum machine  or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) synth  bassline . In 1983,  Jesse Saunders  released what some consider the first house music track, ""On & On."" The mid-1980s also saw the emergence of  New York Garage , a house music hybrid that was inspired by Levan's style and sometimes eschewed the accentuated high-hats of the  Chicago house  sound.   During the mid-1980s,  techno music  emerged from the  Detroit  club scene. Being geographically located between Chicago and New York, Detroit techno artists combined elements of Chicago house and New York garage along with European imports. Techno distanced itself from disco's roots by becoming almost purely electronic with synthesized beats. In 1985, the Winter Music Conference started in  Fort Lauderdale  Florida and became the premier electronic music conference for dance music disc jockeys.   In 1985, TRAX Dance Music Guide was launched by  American Record Pool  in Beverly Hills. It was the first national DJ-published music magazine, created on the  Macintosh  computer using extensive music market research and early desktop publishing tools. In 1986, "" Walk This Way ,"" a rap/rock collaboration by  Run DMC  and  Aerosmith , became the first hip-hop song to reach the Top 10 on the  Billboard Hot 100 . This song was the first exposure of hip-hop music, as well as the concept of the disc jockey as band member and artist, to many mainstream audiences. In 1988,  DJ Times  magazine was first published. It was the first US-based magazine specifically geared toward the professional mobile and club DJ.   Starting in the mid-1980s, the wedding and banquet business changed dramatically with the introduction of DJ music, replacing the bands that had been the norm. Bandleaders, like Jerry Perell and others, started DJ companies, such as NY Rhythm DJ Entertainers. Using their knowledge of audience participation, MC charisma, and ""crowd-pleasing"" repertory selection, the wedding music industry became almost all DJ while combining the class and elegance of the traditional band presentation. New DJs as well as bandleaders with years of experience and professionalism transformed the entire industry. Now, everyone loves a good banquet DJ. The latest trend is to combine real musicians with the DJ music for a more personal and artistic approach.

Some DJs, wanting to be the only source for hearing certain tunes, used ""white labels""  records with no info printed on them  in an effort to prevent other trainspotters from learning what they were spinning. The rave scene changed dance music, the image of DJs, and the nature of promoting. The innovative marketing surrounding the rave scene created the first  superstar  DJs who established marketable ""brands"" around their names and sound. Some of these celebrity DJs toured around the world and were able to branch out into other music-related activities.   During the early 1990s, the Compact Disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity, but gramophone records continued to be made (although in very limited quantities) into the 21st century  particularly for club DJs and for local acts recording on small regional labels. During the mid-1990s,  trance music , having run rampant in the German underground for several years, emerged as a major force in dance music throughout Europe and the UK. It became one of the world's most dominant forms dance music by the end of the 1990s, thanks to a trend away from its repetitive, hypnotic roots, and towards commercialized song structure.   In 1991,  Mobile Beat  magazine, geared specifically toward mobile DJs, began publishing. In 1992,  MPEG  which stands for the  Moving Picture Experts Group , released The MPEG-1 standard, designed to produce reasonable sound at low bit rates. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as  MP3 , later revolutionized the digital music domain. In 1993, the first  internet  ""radio station"", Internet Talk Radio, was developed by Carl Malamud. Because the audio was relayed over the internet, it was possible to access internet radio stations from anywhere in the world. This made it a popular service for both amateur and professional disc jockeys operating from a personal computer.   In 1995, the first full-time, internet-only radio station, Radio HK, began broadcasting the music of  independent  bands. In 1996, Mobile Beat had its first national mobile DJ convention in Las Vegas. During the late 1990s,  nu metal  bands, such as  Korn ,  Limp Bizkit , and  Linkin Park , reached the height of their popularity. This new subgenre of  alternative rock  bore some influence from hip-hop because rhythmic innovation and syncopation are primary, often featuring DJs as band members. As well, during the late 1990s, various DJ and VJ software programs were developed, allowing personal computer users to deejay or veejay using his or her personal music or video files.   In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10.  Final Scratch  debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special  time coded vinyl records  or CDs. While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the ""die hard Vinyl DJs"", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with  computer DJing  pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam, who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the ""CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit"", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology. In 1999,  Shawn Fanning  released  Napster , the first of the massively popular  peer-to-peer   file sharing  systems. During this period, the AVLA (Audio Video Licensing Agency) of Canada announced an MP3 DJing license, administered by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. This meant that DJs could apply for a license giving them the right to ""burn"" their own compilation CDs of ""usable tracks"", instead of having to cart their whole CD collections around to their gigs.   By the 2000s, new technologies such as  voice tracking , allowed single DJs to send announcements across many stations. [ 10 ]  Commercial radio DJs were increasingly limited in their freedom to select which songs to play. Some music aficionados sought  freeform  stations that put the DJs back in control, or chose instead to listen to  satellite radio  services or portable music players.  College radio  stations and other  public radio  outlets continued to be the most common places for freeform play lists in the U.S.   In 2001,  Apple Computer 's  iPod  was introduced and quickly became the highest selling brand of portable digital mp3 audio player. [ 11 ]  The convenience and popularity of the iPod spawned a new type of DJ, the ""MP3J"". First appearing in certain  East London  clubs, and spreading to other music scenes, including New York City, this new DJ scene allowed the average music fan to bring two iPods to an ""iPod Night"", plug in to the mixer, and program a play list without the skill and equipment demanded by a more traditional DJ setup, and without needing to bring a heavy case of CDs.   In 2004  Rane  introduced its own version of the digital vinyl DJ system  Serato Scratch Live  making improvements in overall system stability and more closely emulating the feel of true vinyl. They brought out a hardware mixer version in 2006. [ 12 ]  Soon afterward, many nightclub deejays that had remained true vinyl record aficionados began the transition to becoming digital vinyl users. In 2006, the concept of DJ had its 100-year anniversary.   In the late 2000s, topless female DJs have appeared in special nightclubs, primarily in  Finland  and  Russia .

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup       Main article:  The Beatles' breakup       In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films       Main article:  The Beatles in film       The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy       Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture         Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography       Main article:  The Beatles discography       Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue       Main article:  Northern Songs       In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

Music became innately tied up into causes, opposing certain ideas, influenced by the  sexual revolution ,  feminism ,  Black Power  and  environmentalism .   Central to this trend was a folk  roots revival  that inspired a wave of similar trends across  Europe  and the rest of the world. This stemmed from a revival of  hillbilly music  early in the decade, and drew on  Appalachian folk -pop pioneers  The Weavers .  Singer-songwriters  like  Bob Dylan  and  Joan Baez  broke new ground in lyrical approach and personal style in composition, setting the stage for the next wave of lighter, country and R&B influenced singer-songwriters like  James Taylor ,  Elton John ,  Carole King  and  Cat Stevens , who began topping the charts in the very early 1970s.   The 60s began with  soul music  topping the charts, including pure soul divas and singers specializing in the new, R&B-gospel fusion with a secular approach. Later specialities in soul cropped up, including  girl groups ,  blue-eyed soul ,  brown-eyed soul ,  Memphis soul ,  Philly soul  and, most popular,  Motown . The last part of the decade saw soul singer-songwriters like  Marvin Gaye  invent  album-oriented soul , and  James Brown  and his ever-evolving backing band invent  funk .   Country music in the 1960s was dominated by the  Nashville Sound  until  Merle Haggard  changed the national country sound to the  Bakersfield Sound . For a time, the Bakersfield Sound was the only homegrown music that could compete in sales against an influx of British bands; this was called the  British Invasion , and it sparked a new wave of music and social activism.  Psychedelic rock  arose from this subculture, which opposed the  Vietnam War  and supported  civil rights  and other generally leftist causes. While the energy in this scene remained strong for some time, it soon splintered into competing  heavy metal , early art- punk rock  and  progressive rock .   The 1970s saw various forms of pop music dominating the charts. Often characterized as being shallow, 70s pop took many forms and could be seen as a reaction against the high-energy and activist pop of the previous decade. It began with singer-songwriters like  Carole King  and  Carly Simon  topping the charts, while New York City saw a period of great innovation;  hip hop ,  punk rock  and  salsa  were invented in 70s New York, which was also a center for  electronic music ,  techno  and  disco .   By the middle of the decade, various trends were vying for popular success.  Sly & the Family Stone 's pop-funk had spawned singers like  Roberta Flack  and  Donny Hathaway , alongside  George Clinton 's spacy  P Funk  extravaganzas.  Lynyrd Skynyrd  and the  Allman Brothers Band  led a wave of  country rock  bands while  David Bowie  and other British performers saw  glam rock  gain success. Light progressive-rock bands like  Kansas ,  Journey ,  Chicago  and  Styx  had long-running popularity.  Bruce Springsteen  garnered critical acclaim during much of the decade, finally breaking through in a big way very late in the 70s.  Disco , especially  The Bee Gees , was dominating the charts the last few years of the decade, while  punk rock  and other genres were developing underground.

Girl groups  ( The Angels  (""My Boyfriend's Back""),  The Shirelles  (""Dedicated to the One I Love"") and  blue eyed soul  ( The Righteous Brothers  (""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling""),  Mitch Ryder  (""Devil With a Blue Dress On"")) helped to popularize the music as mainstream, as well as polishing it and removing the grit of gospel. With the popularity of Elvis and other white singers (like  Gene Vincent  (""Be-Bop-A-Lula""),  Roy Acuff  (""The Wreck on the Highway""),  Jerry Lee Lewis  (""Great Balls of Fire"") and  Chet Atkins  (""Mr. Sandman""), as well as black vocalists like  Little Richard  ("" Tutti Frutti ""),  Chuck Berry  ("" Johnny B. Goode ""),  Fats Domino  (""The Fat Man"") and  Chubby Checker  (""The Twist""), a new generation of teens began playing in their own rock bands. The 1960s also saw the arrival of Mexican-American pop, rock and soul acts that drew upon  Tejano  and other influences. These include  Sunny Ozuna  (""Talk to Me"", ""Reina de mi Amor""),  Roberto Pulido y Los Clasicos  and  Latin Breed .   White rock music developed primarily in two places: southern California, where musicians like  Dick Dale  ( Surfers' Choice ) invented  surf rock , and  Britain , where  mod  and  Merseybeat  bands (such as  The Who  ( The Who Sings My Generation ) and  The Rolling Stones ) ( The Rolling Stones (England's Newest Hitmakers) ) began playing their own version of rock that drew more heavily upon American blues pioneers like  Bo Diddley  ("" Mona "" (aka ""I Need You Baby"")),  Howlin' Wolf  ("" Evil ""),  Muddy Waters  (""I Be's Troubled"") and  Jimmy Yancey  (""The Fives"") than their American counterparts, who mostly played a polished form of pop.   The early 1960s saw four centers of American musical innovation:     Southern California surf rock bands like  The Beach Boys  (""Surfin' Safari"")   Detroit -area  Motown  acts like  Smokey Robinson  &  the Miracles  ("" Shop Around ""),  Mary Wells  ("" My Guy ""),  The Supremes  ("" Where Did Our Love Go ""), and  The Temptations  ("" My Girl "")   country music's capital,  Nashville   the now mainstream  Bakersfield sound       [ edit ]   Invention of psychedelia   In addition, Britain's new generation of blues rock gained popularity in parts of their homeland, especially cities like  Liverpool , and cult fame in the States. The popularity of folk singers like  Peter, Paul & Mary  (""Puff the Magic Dragon"") and  Bob Dylan  ( The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan ) influenced all of these groups as they became more closely aligned with the  counterculture  and  drugs . The national sound was moving towards an electric, psychedelic version of rock. In 1962 (see  1962 in music ),  The Beatles  ( Please Please Me ) emerged from England and popularized British rock, while The Beach Boys' success brought harmony-laden surf music to the forefront of the American scene. With country and soul musicians unable to maintain their hipness, both faded from mass consciousness.   The mid-1960s saw the collapse of The Beach Boys as a result of singer and  songwriter   Brian Wilson 's mental problems after releasing one of the most influential rock albums in history,  Pet Sounds . As the  British Invasion  died down, The Beatles created a radical new look and sound which helped bring the Psychedelic movement to the mainstream. The Psychedelic music was a revolutionary sound heavily influenced by drugs, primarily LSD. With the hippie movement beginning to take center stage and the  Summer of Love  in  San francisco , Pyschedelic music began to enter the public's knowledge. The first American Band that introduced and even revolutionized the sound was  Jefferson Airplane . Their 1967 album  Surrealistic Pillow  is considered to be the quintessential album of the movement along with  The Beatles   Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  and  The Doors   debut album . Another band considered to be founders of the movement were  the Grateful Dead , the first  jam band , and considered to be considered the first  cult  act.   The Psychedelic scene went into full circle with the  Monterey Pop Festival . Not only did it feature popular acts of the time such as  Jefferson Airplane  and  The Who , but it also introduced two of the greatest rockers of the movement and arguably in rock history:  Jimi Hendrix  and  Janis Joplin  (who was the lead singer of  Big Brother and the Holding Company  at the Time). The concert ended with a performance by  The Mamas and the Papas  whose more pop/folk sound was beginning to be overshadowed by the  hard rock  bands. Psychedelia-inflected rock dominated black and white audiences. During this period, most of American musical styles for the next forty years began in one form or another, including heavy metal, punk rock, electronic music and hip hop. Perhaps most importantly were two developments. First was the popularization of the LP as a distinct artistic statement. Prior to the early 1960s (and later in most cases), an LP was nothing more than a collection of singles bound together with filler. As the psychedelic revolution progressed, however, lyrics grew more complex and LPs developed to enable the artists to make a more in depth statement than a single song could allow. In addition, rules as to what could be allowed in popular music were lessened -- singles lasted longer than three minutes ( Bob Dylan 's "" Like a Rolling Stone "" was the first of these); singing could be gruff, guttural and not classically beautiful and lyrics could focus on more than simple tales of youth, love songs and ballads to include politically and socially aware lyrics. The idea that popular music could and should change the way one feels and lead social change largely developed during this period, though it was certainly not unheard of before.     [ edit ]   Funk, gospel and album-oriented soul   Black music in the late 1960s diversified. Soul music had arisen as a secularized form of  gospel music . With the rise of psychedelia and folk, however, artists that had previously been best-sellers found themselves unpopular with the new sound. Many, such as The Supremes and The Miracles, never fully recovered, unable to adjust to the changes in music. Others, like the Temptations and  Curtis Mayfield 's  The Impressions , abandoned their original sounds almost completely to adapt to new trends, continuing their momentum into the early 1970s.   Soul music, led at the time by singers like  James Brown  (""(Get Up I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine""), developed into psychedelia-influenced  funk . Bands like  Parliament  ( The Mothership Connection ),  War  ( All Day Music ) and  Funkadelic  ( One Nation Under a Groove ) merged soul with psychedelic rock to cult acclaim but little popular success. Meanwhile,  Sly & the Family Stone  ( Stand! ) and similar acts achieved popular success with their mixture of soul and psychedelia.   Pure soul adapted to the new face of popular music by expanding beyond the simple lyricism of singles to more cohesive and socially-aware, album-oriented soul. This is usually said to have begun with the success of  Marvin Gaye 's  What's Going On  and  Curtis Mayfield 's  Super Fly  soundtrack. They both described the gritty realities of ghetto life with funky, danceable beats and led to the dominant sounds of soul in the 1970s, such as  Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff 's  Philadelphia soul .   Nonsecularized gospel was still popular, though not near the levels of the 1950s boom.  Reverend James Cleveland  was the most influential artist of the period; he introduced choirs to gospel with 1962's  Peace Be Still , recorded with the  Angelic Choir of Nutley  from  New Jersey . Six years later he founded the annual  Gospel Music Workshop of America , which have spread across the world.  Edwin Hawkins  (""Oh Happy Day"") was another major artist of the period. Beginning with artists like  Ray Repp  in 1964, a slick  soft rock  and gospel fusion called  Christian Contemporary Music  (or  CCM ) became popular, which helped lead the way for future rock Christian artists including light country star  Amy Grant  and Christian heavy metal pioneers  Stryper .     [ edit ]   Progressive, punk and heavy metal   A few bands popular among only a small crowd of devoted followers emerged in the late 1960s.  The Nice  ( The Nice ) and  The Moody Blues  ( Days of Future Passed ) (both British) began releasing a series of complex, classical tinged  concept albums  that began a sound known as  progressive rock . Other British bands like  Led Zeppelin  ( Led Zeppelin ) and  Black Sabbath  ( Black Sabbath ) emerged with a form of hard-edged electric blues that came to be known as  heavy metal music . American bands like  The Velvet Underground  ( White Light/White Heat ),  Blue Cheer  ( Vincebus Eruptum ),  Patti Smith  ( Horses ) and  The Stooges  ( Raw Power ) also emerged with fatalistic, artsy lyrics and a fast-driving energetic sound; this was the beginning of  punk rock .     [ edit ]   Country, newgrass and folk   In the 1960s, the  Bakersfield Sound  began its rise to mainstream, led by  Merle Haggard . Bands like  Muleskinner  and  Old and in the Way  invented a progressive form of bluegrass that came to be known as  newgrass . Though this never achieved much mainstream success, newgrass has become a major part of the American country scene. New forms, including  spacegrass  and  supergrass , arose in the 80s, and remained low-key.   The rise of the Bakersfield Sound was a popular example of a  roots revival  in folk music, in which artists and audiences revitalize the traditional music forms of their ancestors, generally as a reaction against dilution of the original culture for mainstream acceptance. In the 1960s and 70s, roots revivals occurred across the globe. The United States saw Appalachian folk music, blues and jazz adapt to rock and roll, forming heavy metal, psychedelia and progressive rock. Other folk forms were also popularized as part of a 1960s roots revival, including Cajun and Hawaiian folk. Cajun music entered the national mainstream for the first time (mostly in the form of  cover  songs called  swamp pop ), becoming a fixture at the influential  Newport Folk Festival .  CoDoFiL  ( Council for the Development of French in Louisiana ), founded in 1968, helped to lead this trend, establishing the  Festivals Acadiens  and  Zydeco Festival , for example. Cajun artists during this period included the  Balfa Brothers ,  D. L. Menard ,  Eddie LeJeune ,  Michael Doucet 's  Beausoleil  and  Barry Jean Ancelet .     [ edit ]   1970s   In the early 1970s,  singer-songwriters  like  James Taylor  (""Fire and Rain"") and  Carole King  ( Tapestry ) topped the charts while prog rock, heavy metal and punk began to differentiate themselves from mainstream music. While most singer-songwriters drew on Anglo folk roots, some drew on their Native American origins, following in the path of pioneers like  Buffy Sainte-Marie  (""Now That the Buffalo's Gone""); other Native American bands like  XIT  ( Plight of the Redman ) and  Redbone , fused Native American and rock influences. The mid-1970s saw the development of  power pop , the marriage of glam and heavy metal to form  glam metal  and the emergence of  disco . By the late 1970s, disco, an electronically-based  dance music , dominated the sound of the US, aided by the breakthrough success of  Saturday Night Fever . Originally associated with urban blacks and gay white males, disco spent a few years at the top of the charts just as  country rock  and prog rock achieved their greatest mainstream success. Country rock bands like  Lynyrd Skynyrd  ( Second Helping ) and pop-prog bands like  Chicago  ( Chicago II ) and  Styx  ( Kilroy Was Here ) dominated the portion of the market not listening to disco with long, bizarre progressive pieces and electric blues based southern rock. At the time,  outlaw country  artists like  Willie Nelson  ( The Red Headed Stranger ) and  David Allan Coe  (""You Never Even Called Me By Name"") dominated the country music charts with tales of cowboys and rebels.   The  Hard rock  sound that was formed in the late 1960s dominated the decade.  Led Zeppelin  became a worldwide phenomenon with albums like  Led Zeppelin IV . Former  Psychedelic  rockers  Pink Floyd  began experimenting with different musical sounds and philosophical lyrics and went on to be one of the most critically and commercially successful bands of the decade. Their influential album  Dark Side of the Moon  is one of the best selling records in music history. Former blues band  Fleetwood Mac , began to change their sound to rock and added American musicians  Stevie Nicks  and  Lindsey Buckingham . They went on to become one of the most popular and successful bands of the decade and released the legendary  Rumours  in 1977, which spent weeks on top of the charts. Another former psychedelic rocker who achieved commercial success in the decade was  Steve Miller  whose album  Fly Like An Eagle  topped the charts in the mid 70's. The decade also introduced the  Blue yster Cult  who achieved mainstream success with their hit single  Don't Fear the Reaper . Other rock bands who were influential and popular in the time include  Aerosmith ,  Heart , and  Van Halen , all of whom found further success in the next decade.     [ edit ]   Underground trends   Heavy metal bands like  KISS  ( Alive! ) began to attract mainstream attention, while punk influenced the developing  glam rock  scene. Taking its cue from the energetic, dirty psychedelia of  The Doors , glam musicians like  David Bowie  ( The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars ) rose to prominence among segments of the population in the early 1970s.   Jamaican immigrants, most notably including  DJ Kool Herc , moved to  New York City  and brought with them the practice of speaking over isolated percussion breaks from popular songs during long dance parties called  block parties ; this was the beginning of  hip hop . Meanwhile,  Cuban  and  Puerto Rican  musicians drew on  mambo  and other Cuban genres to form  salsa music . Early artists included  Hctor Lavoe  and  Willie Coln .   Jewish-American musicians launched a revival of  klezmer  music in the mid-1970s, led by  Berkeley, California 's  The Klezmorim , Boston's  Klezmer Conservatory Band , and New York's  Henry Sapoznik  who formed the  Archive of Recorded Sound  at the  Institute for Jewish Research  in  New York City  and founded the  KlezKamp  festival, where stars like  Howie Lees ,  Max Epstein  and  Sid Beckerman  taught and played.   The roots of  world music , a fusion of rock, pop and other Western music with traditional folk from around the world, arose in the 1970s.  Taj Mahal 's  Happy to Be Just Like I Am  (1972),  Joni Mitchell 's  The Hissing of Summer Lawns  (1975) and  Ry Cooder 's 1976  Chicken Skin Music  (with  Flaco Jimnez  and  Gabby Pahinui ) helped to launch the genre, which was solidified in 1981 with  David Byrne  and  Brian Eno 's  My Life in the Bush of Ghosts .   The late 1970s also saw the coalescence of what eventually became known as punk music. Arty singers like  Patti Smith  ( Horses ) and grungy bands like  The Ramones  ( The Ramones ) emerged from New York, based out of the popular club  CBGB's . Just as  The Clash  ( The Clash ) and the  Sex Pistols  ( Nevermind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols ) defined and popularized the sound of punk in the UK, a similar scene was developing throughout the US. In the early 1980s, disco died a quick death. The popular reaction against disco was swift and final, and the music had ended its reign of commercial influence by 1982 (see  1982 in music ).  New Wave  filled in as the dominant American sound. It had developed out of arty punk bands like the  Talking Heads  ( More Songs About Buildings and Food ), and was popularized by  Depeche Mode  ( Speak and Spell ),  Duran Duran  ( Rio ) and others.

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that Sir Paul will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that Sir Paul will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

Ask for a audio or video recording of a recent gig.  If you have the time, ask about an upcoming event, and go see the act in person. Ask for a list of recent clients and give them a call.      If you decide to hire entertainment for your event through an event planner or an agent, it's generally a good idea to speak directly to the talent to make sure you're comfortable with them.  Find out the cost of the talent and how much the agent is taking off the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Find Entertainers By State / City                                                                          Alabama Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Anniston Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Auburn Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Birmingham Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Decatur Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Dothan Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Florence Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Gadsden Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Huntsville Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Mobile Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Montgomery Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Tuscaloosa Bands - DJs - Entertainers      Alaska Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Anchorage Bands - DJs - Entertainers      American Samoa Bands - DJs - Entertainers       Arizona Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Chandler Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Flagstaff Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Glendale Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Mesa Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Phoenix Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Scottsdale Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Tempe Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Tucson Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Yuma Bands - DJs - Entertainers      Arkansas Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Fayetteville Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Fort Smith Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Jonesboro Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Little Rock Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Pine Bluff Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Springdale Bands - DJs - Entertainers      California Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Bakersfield Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Chico Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Fresno Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Long Beach Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Los Angeles Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Merced Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Modesto Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Monterey Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Napa Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Oakland Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Oceanside Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Oxnard Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Pasadena Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Petaluma Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Redding Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Riverside Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Sacramento Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Salinas Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  San Diego Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  San Francisco Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  San Jose Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  San Luis Obispo Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Santa Barbara Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Santa Cruz Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Santa Monica Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Santa Rosa Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Sonoma Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Stockton Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Tahoe City Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Visalia Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Yuba City Bands - DJs - Entertainers      Colorado Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Colorado Springs Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Denver Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Fort Collins Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Grand Junction Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Loveland Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Pueblo Bands - DJs - Entertainers      Connecticut Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Bridgeport Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Hartford Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  New Haven Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  New London Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Norwich Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Stamford Bands - DJs - Entertainers      Delaware Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Dover Bands - DJs - Entertainers ,  Wilmington Bands - DJs - Entertainers      District of Columbia Bands - DJs - Entertainers     Washington Bands - DJs - Entertainers      Fed.

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

Formerly named The Olympic Hopefuls until the Olympic committee protested, they've had more changes than just their name before the release of their new album, ""Now Playing at the One-Seat Theater.""      (12/16/2008)                                                                Longwave        With their fourth album ""Secret are Sinister"" under their belts, Brooklyn indie-rockers Longwave are hoping the release of this album will go better than the last. Challenges like Hurricane Katrina, a record label merger, and a canceled tour plagued the release of their previous album ""There's A Fire."" After some encouragement, the band decided to record another record.      (12/16/2008)                                                            Wayne Coyne brings Christmas to Mars     It's natural that the Flaming Lips' new dramatic feature film, Christmas on Mars -  conceived by bandleader Wayne Coyne and billed as ""a fantastical film freak-out"" - should contain all of the psychedelia, drama, humor and hopefulness that fans have come to love about the band's music itself.      (12/15/2008)                                                         Golden Animals        They met in Brooklyn where the duo of guitarist Tommy Eisner and drummer Linda Beecroft created the bluesy psychedelic folk-rock of Golden Animals. After the release of their first EP in 2006, they moved to southern California for a more laidback atmosphere to write their full-length.      (12/15/2008)                                                        Dan Wilson        Minneapolis' Dan Wilson has been known as many things: frontman in Semisonic and guitarist in Trip Shakespeare, Grammy Award winner for writing The Dixie Chick's ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" and producer for two of Mike Doughty's albums. He's also worked with musicians like Rachael Yamagata, Mandy Moore, Jeremy Messersmith, and Jason Mraz. In 2007, Dan Wilson released a solo album, ""Free Life"" on Rick Rubin's American Recordings. With all of that on his musical resume, he still calls the Twin Cities home.      (12/09/2008)                                                        Ryan Adams        Ryan Adams may have left behind the confines of the ""alt-country"" genre long ago, but the moniker still tends to cling to him - despite having spent a fair chunk of the past decade-plus making music that has drawn from a broad and deep well of influences.      (12/10/2008)                                                         Heiruspecs        The heavy-touring Hip Hop group Heiruspecs formed in 1997 while in a high school recording arts program at St. Paul Central High School.  The band is mostly known for their raw, live sound.      (12/12/2008)                                                     A conversation with Noel Gallagher of Oasis     Oasis formed in Manchester, England, in 1993. The groups just released their eighth studio album, ""Dig Out Your Soul."" Steve Seel talked with Noel Gallagher about a recent fan attack and the Gallagher's fascination with guns.      (11/26/2008)                                                        Tom Morello        Tom Morello is probably best known for his work with the band Rage Against The Machine. However, he takes on the moniker ""The Nightwatchman"" when he performs his Woody Guthrie-inspired solo work.      (11/11/2008)                                                        Krista Detor        Singer-songwriter Krista Detor has roots all over the U.S., including California, North Dakota, and her current home in Bloomington, Indiana. She's moved around a lot in her career and her touring schedule echoes that long road. She'll be doing her third European tour in 12 months in March of 2009.      (12/03/2008)                                                        Meg Hutchinson        One would think that folksingers in Boston are lining up to get gigs and trying to out-do each other in a fiercely competitive scene. But Meg Hutchinson says it's more of a family atmosphere. She's one of Red House Records' newest singer-songwriters and says the Boston scene, where she lives now, is supportive and thriving.      (12/02/2008)                                                         Calexico        Former Giant Sand members, Joey Burns and John Convertino, collaborated in 1996 and started the electic acoustic folk-world-rock band Calexico, named for the border town in California.      (11/25/2008)                                                        Sebastien Grainger        The name Sebastien Grainger may not be familiar, but his voice might ring a bell. As the former singer and drummer in Death from Above 1979, Grainger jump-started his solo career after the band parted ways in 2006.      (11/24/2008)                                                        John Gorka        Gorka recorded his very first album, ""I Know"", on the Red House label back in 1987. He then signed with Windham Hill and recorded five more albums before returning to Red House for four more. John is currently recording new material for yet another Red House recording.      (11/21/2008)                                                        Ben Sollee        Ben Sollee takes the cello way out of it's roots as a classical stringed instrument. While his music teacher gave him permission to study his ""other"" music, he made sure Sollee kept his nose firmly planted in the traditional cello repertoire.

Formerly named The Olympic Hopefuls until the Olympic committee protested, they've had more changes than just their name before the release of their new album, ""Now Playing at the One-Seat Theater.""                                                     Longwave        With their fourth album ""Secret are Sinister"" under their belts, Brooklyn indie-rockers Longwave are hoping the release of this album will go better than the last. Challenges like Hurricane Katrina, a record label merger, and a canceled tour plagued the release of their previous album ""There's A Fire."" After some encouragement, the band decided to record another record.                                                 Wayne Coyne brings Christmas to Mars     It's natural that the Flaming Lips' new dramatic feature film, Christmas on Mars -  conceived by bandleader Wayne Coyne and billed as ""a fantastical film freak-out"" - should contain all of the psychedelia, drama, humor and hopefulness that fans have come to love about the band's music itself.                                                     Golden Animals        They met in Brooklyn where the duo of guitarist Tommy Eisner and drummer Linda Beecroft created the bluesy psychedelic folk-rock of Golden Animals. After the release of their first EP in 2006, they moved to southern California for a more laidback atmosphere to write their full-length.                                                    Dan Wilson        Minneapolis' Dan Wilson has been known as many things: frontman in Semisonic and guitarist in Trip Shakespeare, Grammy Award winner for writing The Dixie Chick's ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" and producer for two of Mike Doughty's albums. He's also worked with musicians like Rachael Yamagata, Mandy Moore, Jeremy Messersmith, and Jason Mraz. In 2007, Dan Wilson released a solo album, ""Free Life"" on Rick Rubin's American Recordings. With all of that on his musical resume, he still calls the Twin Cities home.                                                    Ryan Adams        Ryan Adams may have left behind the confines of the ""alt-country"" genre long ago, but the moniker still tends to cling to him - despite having spent a fair chunk of the past decade-plus making music that has drawn from a broad and deep well of influences.

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time.

Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup       Main article:  The Beatles' breakup       In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films       Main article:  The Beatles in film       The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy       Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture         Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography       Main article:  The Beatles discography       Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue       Main article:  Northern Songs       In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that Sir Paul will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup       Main article:  The Beatles' breakup       In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films       Main article:  The Beatles in film       The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy       Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture         Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography       Main article:  The Beatles discography       Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue       Main article:  Northern Songs       In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup       Main article:  The Beatles' breakup       In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films       Main article:  The Beatles in film       The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy       Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture         Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography       Main article:  The Beatles discography       Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue       Main article:  Northern Songs       In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it.""

See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup       Main article:  The Beatles' breakup       In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films       Main article:  The Beatles in film       The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy       Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture         Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography       Main article:  The Beatles discography       Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue       Main article:  Northern Songs       In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! , Elvis and  Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                       ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   A video game in the style of  Rock Band , based solely on The Beatles, is reportedly in development and scheduled for a release of 9 September, 2009. [ 104 ]   On 4 March 2009 the  BBC  reported that McCartney will headline a charity concert with one of the special guests listed as Ringo Starr. The concert is set for 4 April 2009 at  Radio City Music Hall . [ 105 ]     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 106 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 107 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 108 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 109 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 110 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 111 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 112 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 113 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 114 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 115 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 116 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 116 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 117 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 118 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 119 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 120 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 121 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 122 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 123 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 123 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup       Main article:  The Beatles' breakup       In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films       Main article:  The Beatles in film       The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy       Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture         Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography       Main article:  The Beatles discography       Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue       Main article:  Northern Songs       In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup       Main article:  The Beatles' breakup       In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films       Main article:  The Beatles in film       The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy       Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture         Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography       Main article:  The Beatles discography       Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue       Main article:  Northern Songs       In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and mutilated plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup   Main article:  The Beatles' breakup   In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films   Main article:  The Beatles in film   The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy   Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture     Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography   Main article:  The Beatles discography   Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue   Main article:  Northern Songs   In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters.
