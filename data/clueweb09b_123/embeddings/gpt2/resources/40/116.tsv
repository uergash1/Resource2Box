Two common paths exist for becoming a paralegal - earning an associate's degree in paralegal studies or pursuing a bachelor's degree and then completing a certification course in paralegal studies.    The associate's degree from a community college is the more common of the two. A less common path offered by some colleges is to earn a bachelor's or master's degree in paralegal studies. This may appeal to potential employers, since it indicates a higher level of training than that earned in a 2-year associate degree program. But with jobs expected to remain plentiful, it shouldn't be necessary to have one of the more advanced degrees. Graduation from one of the 260 paralegal programs approved by the American Bar Association, however, can increase employment opportunities.    Any paralegal program should include:     Courses in the legal application of computers   Internship opportunities   Job placement services   Legal research courses     Voluntary certification does exist. The National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) has set the standards for this certification, called either the Certified Legal Assistant (CLA) or Certified Paralegal (CP) credential. It involves a 2-day exam.   Job Opportunities for Paralegals   Most paralegals work at private law firms, while the rest work for the government and corporate legal departments. A very small percentage freelances, contracting out services to various employers.   Employment should increase 22% from 2006 to 2016, much faster than the national average. Since paralegals cost a lot less than lawyers, many firms choose to hire more of them and fewer attorneys.    Salaries for paralegals vary greatly, but the median annual earnings in 2006 were $43,040.

Eager young professionals were trained on the job. But that's changed in recent years. Today,  the Bureau of Labor Statistics advises those interested in pursuing a career as a paralegal to get formal training as those with a degree will have the best job prospects. Getting the requisite paralegal training is fairly simple. There are basically three routes you can take that will equip you with the necessary skills and credentials to apply for paralegal jobs. If you already have a bachelor's degree, you can take a paralegal certification program that will last a few months. If you don't have a degree, then you have two choices: enroll in a two-year paralegal degree program that results in an associates degree, or complete a four-year bachelor's degree program at a college or university. What Paralegals Earn Paralegals salaries range widely depending on what type of firm they work for and where that firm is located. A paralegal working for a high-profile law firm in New York City, San Francisco, or Washington, D.C., for example, will typically earn more than one working for a small firm in Wichita, Kansas. The median annual earnings for paralegals in 2004 was nearly $40,000, including bonuses. The top 10 percent most highly paid paralegals earned more than $61,000.  It's also a good time to enter the paralegal field. Job growth among paralegals is expected to be much faster than the average for all occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

View All »                          Online Paralegal & Legal Degree FAQs         What Are the Educational Requirements for a Career in Paralegal and Legal Services?  Paralegals research cases extensively, writing and preparing papers and exhibitions for cases and managing them. As a result, an intimate understanding of the law is required. All paralegals must have at least an associate's degree or paralegal certification, if not a bachelor's degree.  Most paralegals are hired based on an associate's degree in paralegal studies from a community college. Technical schools also offer paralegal studies, along with online colleges.    Who Is an Ideal Candidate for Online Paralegal and Legal Services Classes?   Working as a legal assistant or paralegal is best for individuals who have a genuine interest and strong background in law. You should also have excellent organizational and communication skills, as well as researching, reading, writing and analyzing skills.   What Are Some Career Choices in Paralegal and Legal Services?   Since being a paralegal is a vocational position, paralegal studies will lead to a job as a legal assistant. Some paralegals decide later to go back to school and become lawyers by applying to law school. However, many remain as paralegals, often working with the same lawyer and building a relationship with that person for years.    Paralegals get to choose which field of law they would like to work in, such as corporate, intellectual property, international, criminal, tax, real estate or labor. Large firms allow paralegals to choose a specialization, such as copyright issues in entertainment law.   Why Would Someone Take Online Paralegal and Legal Services Classes?  The everyday stresses of a job, family life and other responsibilities often prevent people from enrolling in school. With online degree programs, you can become a paralegal in a short amount of time without having to change your schedule.     An online paralegal degree program provides more flexibility than traditional universities do, which makes it very appealing to students with obligations outside of school. You can apply for a two-year program or a certification program. Make sure the online school you choose is accredited and certified by the American Bar Association.

Although they perform many of the tasks as lawyers,                                 they are prohibited from doing duties, which                                 are considered to be the practice of law, such                                 as setting legal fees, giving legal advice, and                                 presenting cases in the court.

After thorough analysis of infrastructure,                                 they prepare written reports, which in turn will                                 be used by attorneys in determining how cases                                 should be handled.                                      Paralegals are mostly employed in law firms, corporate legal departments and   various government offices. Paralegals are projected to grow faster than average,   as law offices try to reduce costs by assigning them tasks formerly carried   out by lawyers.

The Florida Metropolitan             University  offers the following online BS in paralegal studies.                                 Bachelor                 of Science - Paralegal                   Lawyers  often delegate                 many of their tasks to Legal Assistants or Paralegals. Paralegals                 perform a growing                   range of tasks in  legal offices and in fact carry out many                   of the same tasks as lawyers. These include helping lawyers                   prepare for corporate meetings,  trials,  hearings and closings.                   Paralegals investigate the facts of cases and ensure that all                   relevant                   information is considered. They                   also identify  other materials including legal articles, judicial                   decisions and appropriate laws that are relevant to assigned                   cases. They may prepare                   written reports that attorneys use in determining how cases                   should be handled and help draft  trusts, separation agreements                   and mortgages. In                   general, paralegals analyze legal material, collect                   and analyze evidence for agency hearings, conduct research                   for attorneys and maintain                   reference files.

Finding the paralegal school that fits your lifestyle, career intentions and budget is a difficult task, then you have to figure out if you need to attend an ABA approved school or if attending a non-ABA approved school will get you where you need to go and is just as good. All the information out there arguing the importance of ABA approved schools versus non-ABA schools can make your decision that more difficult. We have prepared support arguments for each option in hopes that your choice will be made more clear.              ABA Approved        Non-ABA Approved                        Some Law Firms, State Bar Associations and Paralegal organizations support ABA approved schools and feel that it is a competitive advantage in the hiring process at more sought after and lucrative positions.          Provides employer an assurance that the paralegal has received the necessary training to be a competent hire.          Some state bar associations and paralegal associations, such as in the states of Colorado, Wisconsin and Nevada advocate preferences for graduates of ABA approved paralegal programs.         The International Paralegal Management Association members have reported that they look mor favorably upon job candidates that have graduated from ABA approved paralegal schools.                      Research has found that law firms do not always consider graduation from an ABA approved paralegal school the most important factor in hiring a paralegal.          Nationwide, there are a large number of paralegal programs that meet the ABA standards but do not pursue approval based on the costs associated with the process. These approval costs are often passed on to students through higher tuition costs and cutbacks in student resources at ABA approved paralegal schools.          The ABA cannot formally accredit any paralegal program, but will approve a program that meets specific standards for a designated fee.         ABA approved paralegal schools generally have higher tuititions  than non-ABA approved paralegal schools.          No ABA approved paralegal school has an online or correspondence option.         Based on the statistic that approximately 250 of 1200 paralegal programs nationally are ABA approved, it can be quite difficult to find and attend an ABA approved paralegal school, geographically speaking.                Find ABA Approved Paralegal Programs   Find Non-ABA Approved Online Paralegal Programs   Find Paralegal Programs by State   The paralegal school you choose should be based on your financial position, geographical location, specific career goals and where you actually want to work. Before you choose a school, find out what the most important hiring decisions are at your desired place of employment.

Depending on their career goals, students have the choice of enrolling in a certificate program or earning an associate or bachelor degree. When studying to become a paralegal, individuals gain an overview of the legal system. They study ethics, contracts, civil litigation, torts, probate, property, evidence, wills, and trusts. Students also learn the fundamentals of legal writing, drafting, research, analysis, and communication.    Under the supervision of a lawyer, paralegals use these skills to perform research; interview clients and witnesses; draft motions; gather evidence; and assist at trials. In certain other cases, they may be called on to prepare real estate documents, contracts, and probate, or manage investigations.

Paralegal       A paralegal is the lawyer’s trusty assistant, Robin to his Batman. Paralegals and Legal Assistants are not lawyers but may have completed a degree, including an online paralegal degree, such as the B.S. or A.A.S. in Applied Science in Paralegal Studies. Paralegals and Legal Assistants are expected to have significant knowledge of the law, particularly with regard to finding relevant statutes or precedents for a given case.  Online paralegal courses  are designed to prepare you with the knowledge you need.  A Legal Secretary is also an assistant to a lawyer. In addition to performing typical secretarial duties such as typing and filing, a legal secretary often has extensive knowledge of the lawyer’s field of specialty and can do research, prepare documents and handle the day-to-day activities around a case, and will therefore also benefit from enrolling in  online paralegal courses .         Now that we’ve laid down the law with regard to an accredited online paralegal degree, why not find out more about how earning an online paralegal degree can help you begin an exciting career as a lawyer, paralegal, legal secretary, or legal assistant.              Click here for a complete list of online paralegal courses and degree programs                                                           Request Info >>>            Concord Law School          Concord Law School is accredited by the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) and is also approved in the State of California by the Bureau of Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education.
