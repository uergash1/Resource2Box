Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code.                     Meet Django   Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.   Developed four years ago by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.   Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the  DRY  principle .   Dive in by  reading the overview →   When you're ready to code, read the  installation guide  and  tutorial .      The Django framework    Object-relational mapper    Define your  data models  entirely in Python. You get a rich,  dynamic database-access API  for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.    Automatic admin interface    Save yourself the tedious work of creating interfaces for people to add and update content.  Django does that automatically , and it's production-ready.    Elegant URL design    Design pretty,  cruft-free URLs  with no framework-specific limitations. Be as flexible as you like.    Template system    Use Django's powerful, extensible and designer-friendly  template language  to separate design, content and Python code.    Cache system    Hook into memcached or other cache frameworks for  super performance  — caching is as granular as you need.           Internationalization           Django has full support for  multi-language applications , letting you specify translation strings and providing hooks for language-specific functionality.

A  patched  copy of Boost 1.37.0 distribution   A copy of the latest ASL distribution   Patience     The Easy Way     If you are Inside Adobe    Within Adobe the Software Technology Lab maintains Perforce servers for distributions of both Boost and the Adobe Source Libraries. This is the preferred method of downloading ASL within Adobe, as the Boost sources are already patched and placed correctly. Please see the STLab website for more information on getting ASL this way.  The rest of this document is not for you.      Building the Libraries Automatically    Two automated net install scripts have been written to ease in the downloading and building of the Adobe Source Libraries. Given a development environment, these scripts will do all the downloading, patching and building necessary to get a working build of ASL and Adobe Begin on your computer.  The Windows version can be downloaded from  http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/adobe-source/asl_1.0.40_net_setup.bat   The *N*X (including Mac OS X) version can be downloaded from  http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/adobe-source/asl_1.0.40_net_setup.sh   Please also be aware that the script requires use of FTP and HTTP. If you are behind a firewall or cannot otherwise use FTP, the scripts will not work.  The rest of this document is not for you.      The Other Way     Obtaining and Patching Intel Thread Building Blocks    The Intel Thread Building Blocks tbb21_009oss source distribution can be downloaded from  http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/ver.php?fid=122   Decompress the  distribution and move the resulting directory to:     ~/adobe_root/ (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\ (Windows)    The folder should be named intel_tbb_libraries resulting in the structure:     ~/adobe_root/intel_tbb_libraries/ (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\intel_tbb_libraries\ (Windows)    It is not necessary to build the Intel TBB library with this release. The Adobe libraries currently depend only upon the headers of the Intel Library.        Obtaining and Patching Boost    The Boost 1.37.0 distribution can be downloaded from  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586      Patching Boost    Decompress the Boost distribution and move the resulting directory to:     ~/adobe_root/ (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\ (Windows)    The folder should be named boost_libraries resulting in the structure:     ~/adobe_root/boost_libraries/ (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\boost_libraries\ (Windows)    Boost must be patched with a small number of minor changes. A patchfile with those changes can be found at:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/tools/boost_1_37_0_patch_01.txt (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\adobe_source_libraries\boost_1_37_0_patch_01.txt (Windows)     Patching under *N*X    You can use the Unix patch command to make the necessary changes, but first make sure all the line endings in the affected files are Unix line endings. To use the supplied patch under Unix issue the following command:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/tools/patch_boost.sh     Patching under Win32    Win32 users can use the patchfile provided, but there are some caveats. First, the patchfile is distributed with Unix line endings, which must first be converted to DOS line endings. If you do not have a program to accomplish this, there is a small command line tool called  leconv  that will do this for you. It is in:     C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries\tools\    The GNUWin32 project has made a version of patch for Win32. It can be obtained at  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32   If you already use boost build, please make sure that the adobe version of bjam will be the one found in your path, since ASL relies on patched support files found relative to the bjam executable.     Build Option 1: Using Boost Build (bjam)    Boost 1.37.0 ships with a single version of the build tool that supports both v1 and v2 syntax. When the Adobe patch instructions are followed, boost build will be upgraded to be able to produce universal binaries on the macintosh, but only when bjam invoked using v2 syntax. V1 files are untouched by the patch. If you will be moving from v1 to v2 syntax then the guide at  http://boost.sourceforge.net/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/vs_v1.html  may be of some use.     Building Under Win32    The Adobe Source Libraries have been compiled and tested under MSVC   9. Assuming you have installed ASL to the top of your C drive, the directory structure for setting up a build is as follows:     C:\adobe_root\adobe_source_libraries\  C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries\  C:\adobe_root\boost_libraries\    Note that the contents of the adobe directories are obtained through the ASL distributions, while the boost directory contains a patched release of Boost.  Building the ASL libraries is handled through a build script that will setup the Boost build system and then build the ASL. Open up a Win32 command line terminal and run:     cd C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries  ..\adobe_source_libraries\tools\build.bat    Once this batch file has completed, you don't need to run it again to build ASL. A more efficient way to build ASL would be to open up a Win32 command line terminal, and run:     cd C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries  ..\adobe_source_libraries\tools\bjam.exe    You must build from under   the  C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries   directory in   order to assure that all artifacts are built. If you only require   the adobe_source_libraries, but not the adobe_platform_libraries,   you can build from  C:\adobe_root\adobe_source_libraries    instead.     For MSVC 8 Express Users    When we last tested, VC 8 Express was not capable of building Win32 executables out of the box and would fail to build ASL. here are some notes on updating MSVC 8 Express to be Win32/ASL capable:  1.  You must begin by downloading the platform SDK from  Microsoft's website.   If you use the web install you can choose  not  to download most of the SDK components to save time. Only the Core SDK appears to be required.  2.  Copy the ""bin"", ""include"" and ""lib"" directory from the PSDK-installation into ""%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC""  At this point, for example, windows.h should be available within your MSVC installation. This would be a good time to make sure that you can successfully build the IDE project ""Begin"" located in ...\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries\msvc_ide\vc8   Another issue was that boost build v2 from boost 1.33.1 did not provide a VC 8 Express savvy msvc-config, so we must configure boost build manually. Follow the next steps to complete VC 8 Express specific preparation:  3.  Choose a ""home"" directory, and add a %HOME% environment variable referring to it. For example, if you chose ""C:\Home"", you would set the env var by opening the system control panel/advanced/environment variables and adding the variable HOME for all users with value C:\Home.  4.  Now create a file in the chosen HOME directory named user-config.jam . The file must contain the following contents (assuming that you installed VC 8 Express in the default location):     import toolset : using ;  using msvc : 8.0 : ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin\cl.exe"" ;    5. Open a fresh command window (to pick up the new env var), cd to your C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries directory and invoke ..\adobe_source_libraries\tools\build.bat and you should be on your way.     Building for Mac, *N*X    The adobe_source_libraries component has been compiled and tested under various versions of GCC 4.3.0. The adobe_platform_libraries component is currently not supported under *N*X or cygwin. If you have installed ASL to your home directory, the directory structure for setting up a build is as follows:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/ ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries/ # unused under *N*X/cygwin ~/adobe_root/boost_libraries/ ~/adobe_root/intel_tbb_libraries/ # unused under cygwin    Note that the contents of the adobe directories are obtained through the ASL distribution, while the boost/intel directories contain (patched) releases of those third party libraries.  Building the ASL libraries is handled through a build script that will setup the Boost build system and then build the ASL. The build script is called:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/tools/build.sh    Running this script from a command line from the    ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries  directory will begin the build   process.  Once this batch file has completed, you don't need to run   it again to build ASL. A more efficient way to build ASL would be to   open up a command line terminal and run:     cd ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries  ../adobe_source_libraries/tools/bjam    You must build from under the  ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries   directory in order to assure that all artifacts are built. If you only require the adobe_source_libraries, or if you if you are on a platform for which only adobe_source_libraries are supported (*N*X or cygwin), you can build from  ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries  instead.     MacOS X Universal Binary Support    By default ASL is set up to build Universal Binaries for release targets. In order to disable universal binary building within ASL     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/Jamfile.v2    and edit the MACOSX case involving the <architecture>combined clause.     Troubleshooting the Build    Build fails to run? Check:        Intel TBB is in the proper place      Boost is in its proper place         Boost was properly patched  Permissions allow execution of the build scripts   Line endings of all files are correct for your platform   Build commands were invoked from proper directory   Do not try to use MSVC 8 Express without following Express-specific notes above   Make sure no other bjam executables will be picked up in your PATH ahead of the adobe provided version.   Don't try to build adobe_platform_libraries under cygwin or *N*X. Only adobe_source_libraries are presently tested on those platforms.     bjam Details    Executing the build script will build various excecutables including bjam (boost build, compatible with version 1 and 2) in a sub-directory named after the platform, and copy it into the ASL tools directory. The build will then cause all libraries including libasl, libasl_dev, and the appropriate pieces of Boost to be built. It will also build and run several test applications. Copious output will be produced, indicating the success or failure of the build and the associated tests. Debug and Release targets are supported. The default is to build and use static libraries throughout, except that DLL versions of platform runtime libraries are employed.  The ""projects"" used by BBv2 are always named Jamfile.v2. Each Jamfile.v2 inherits settings from any Jamfile.v2's that appear in its parent directories, so the Jamfile.v2's in the test directories are relatively sparse.     Jamfile.v2 Miscellanea     Some Jamfile.v2's specify build requirements and settings that will be applied to all users of a library.   passing bjam the -d2 option will cause the commands used in the build to be displayed.   Adobe libs and executables are written to a sub-directory of     ~/adobe_root/built_artifacts/ (*N*X)    or     C:\adobe_root\built_artifacts\ (Windows)    named according to the build settings. There are also 'bundled'   artifact collections that, if built explicitly via     bjam test/begin//install_program  will appear under:     ~/adobe_root/built_artifacts/install/ (*N*X)    or     C:\adobe_root\built_artifacts\install\ (Windows)     The required boost libraries, including filesystem, threads,     parts of test, and signal, will be built in a sub-directory of     ~/adobe_root/boost_libraries/bin.v2/ (*N*X)    or     C:\adobe_root\boost_libraries\bin.v2\ (Windows)     It is possible to create an IDE project for MSVC (and probably for XCode, although this has not been tested) that links to the static libs in the appropriate bin folders. In this scenario it is very important to make sure that the compiler and linker settings used in the IDE match those used for the artifacts produced using BBv2. The -d2 option above is helpful for this purpose. If you try this and receive many link errors on Windows it maybe that your C++/code generation/runtime settings are set to /MTd instead of /MDd.     More information on BBv2 can be found at  http://boost.sourceforge.net/boost-build2/doc/html/index.html      Build Option 2: Using an IDE     Building with MSVC 9    There are MSVC 9 .sln and .vcproj files available for use at     C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_librariesmsvc_ide\    Opening the begin.sln file and building the 'begin' project will build all the necessary library dependencies (including the needed Boost libraries.)     Building with XCode    There are XCode .xcodeproj files available for use at     C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries\xcode_ide\    Opening the begin.xcodeproj file and building any configuration therein will build all the necessary library dependencies (including the needed Boost libraries.)     MacOS X Universal Binary Support    To disable building Universal Binaries with the XCode IDE projects, open the top-level xcconfig file for your respective binary. For example:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries/xcode_ide/adobe_xconfig_application.xcconfig    and edit the value in the ""Artifact Architecture"" section. Reloading the XCode IDE projects at that time will cause Universal Binary support to be dropped, building only PowerPC versions of the binaries. Alternatively, you can drop ""ppc"" if you are only interested in building MacTel versions of the binaries.     MacOS X Binary Artifact Compatibility    On Mac OS X there is an environment variable  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET  that can be optionally set to 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, or 10.4. When this variable is set to one of those values, it establishes the minimum operating system version that is supported by your binary artifact. For the Adobe Source Libraries, all binaries are built by default with a minimum compatibility of Mac OS X 10.4.   In bjam, this variable is set in the top level Jamfile.    In XCode, this is managed with the top-level xcconfig file for the binary artifact.     Known Issues     General Issues    We are aware the release is generally quite cumbersome, and are still figuring out how to package releases more efficiently.  BBv2 intentionally builds the debug variant of ASL with ""warnings as errors"" turned on. The release variant is not built with this setting on because of warnings within some library headers in the GCC STL.     Issues Surrounding MSVC 's ""Safe"" Libraries    ASL does not support the non-standard ""Safe"" C and C++ libraries shipping beginning with Visual C++ 8.0. This may result in many spurious warnings from ASL, Boost, and other standards-conforming C and C++ libraries. To suppress these warnings, define the macros     _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE    and     _SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE    The MSVC command-line settings to define these macros is:     \D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE \D_SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE    The ASL header file  adobe/config.hpp  includes checks when compiling with MSVC 8.0 to make sure these macros are defined. To disable this check, define the following macro before including  adobe/config.hpp :     ADOBE_TEST_MICROSOFT_NO_DEPRECATE=0    The Jamfile at the top of the ASL distribution has this macro defined by default. Another option to disable the warnings in your code is by supressing the warnings with a pragma:     #pragma warning ( disable : 4996 )     Executing Adobe Begin on Windows XP on a Non-Development Machine    When an app is built using a version of MSVC, that version of Microsoft's Runtimes Libraries must be 'findable' by the OS in order to launch the application. Part of Microsoft's solution to this problem includes the embedding of an application manifest file into the application. On development machines, these files are automatically installed in C:\WINDOWS\system32\. The manifest file describes the binary's dependencies to external DLLs, and the OS reads the file and hunts down the dependencies to load them. In a clean-install XP system, the Runtime Libraries for MSVC 7.0, 7.1, 8, and 9 do not exist, which will lead ultimately to the failure to launch applications built with these compilers on non-development machines.  Our current workaround to this problem is to *not* embed the manifest file in the binary directly, but leave it as a sibling to the app. Then the necessary runtime libraries must also be placed as siblings to the app, along with a manifest file describing them to the OS. For some reason both of these steps are required, and then the app will run in a clean XP installation. (Thanks to Ken Silver for being the first one report Adobe Begin failing to load on his non-development machine.)     Feedback    The Adobe Source Libraries have been used with success within Adobe applications to increase robustness and correctness of code. As developers of an open source project, we are confident that there are other success stories outside of Adobe as well. We encourage you to contribute a story of your own:     What is the name of your project?   What is the purpose of the project?   What led you to choose ASL?   Was ASL used from the start of the project? If not, how did its inclusion impact your project? How does using ASL affect your project development as a whole?   How large is your project?   How would you rate the success of your project?   Is there any other interesting information worth sharing?    Submissions will be included in a success stories web page on the stlab.adobe.com site.

We are based in Krefeld, Germany (Marcus) and Wellington, New Zealand (Kai) and are deeply committed to Adobe's webtechnologies Apollo, ColdFusion, Connect, Flash, Flex, Livecycle and Spectra (listed in alphabetical order without any particular preference ;)             Animation by  nectarine                                         « Unit testing with Flex  |   Main  |  CFCamps in Australia »               November 03, 2007       Book review: O'Reilly short cuts - Introduction to Flex 2     O'Reilly has a series of so called  ""Short Cuts"" , PDF e-books that introduce new technologies or major updates of those in a brief, compact way.  Introduction to Flex 2.0  by Roger Braunstein is such a ""Short Cuts"" title and comprises 88 pages full of valuable information for the upcoming Flex developer :)    The author bascially starts explaining the basic concepts of Flex 2, the relationship between MXML and ActionScript and then dives into some more details.    The first chapter is about ActionScript 3 and I can really recommend it as a wrap-up of the particular way Adobe has morphed the language coming from an AS 1 or AS 2 background. It contains information on the Virtual Machines, the new E4X enginge and topics such as methods, properties, classes, reflection etc. It's not an introduction into OO, but it will give you a good grasp on what you need to know if you want to work with AS 3.    Chapter 2 is particularly on Flex. You'll learn to differentiate between Containers and Components and you'll have a look at event handling, data binding, basic MVC concepts in Flex and accessing data from Flex applications.    The third and also the fifth section of the book cover very general topics such as Effects and Transitions, Cursor Management and charting. But Roger also introduces validation and formatting and discusses internationalization along the way.    Stop, I've missed one chapter, haven't I? Right, chapter 4 is actually about extending Flex, i.e custom UI components, custom styles etc. Given that that chapter just spans 10 pages, it's extremly compact and obviously just gives you a view down from 30,000 ft on the different options.    Wrap-up: The book is good and a very handy little tool to have, but do not expect it to be a tutorial to learn Flex from the scratch - that should be obvious, given that it has 88 pages.     So, who is this book useful for? I'd say for people who consider moving to Flex 2 or 3 from Java, Flash or earlier versions of Flex; but also for the not-that-tech-savy manager person who wants to get a better understanding what Flex and the whole RIA fuzz is about. You could also give it to your dev team leader if you want to get her/him interested in the technology.

They are only used by a small amount of           users and they could allow local users to fill up the memory, if they aren't secured properly.  The old web control panel and the disassembler have been removed from the code. They have been replaced with a set of php functions           that allow the same functionality to be implemented in a PHP script. The control.php and the dasm.php files are such scripts. More           information about this can be found in the  README .  A lot of bugfixes which bring us closer to full PHP 5.1 support.        This version is already quite stable and some people are already using it in production environments. Please test this beta2 as good and as much as you can. If you find a bug, report it back to us on the website and if possible add a small snippet of code so we can reproduce it.     Note: always clean the file cache before upgrading. Otherwise you'll get into trouble.

Updated the README a little more for the new control panel  Added release notes for beta2  Bumped up version to 0.9.5-beta2  Patch for dasm.php form Stadler, see  #23   Fixed typo in optimizer which broke compilation for PHP != 5.1  Released beta2   2006-04-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed some typos in dasm.php  Added authentication to the disassembler   2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fixed handling of interfaces. This fixes sf.net bug  #1440575 .        This fix also introduces some changes in the cached object structure so remember to empty your disk caches if you have them. This is always a good thing to do after upgrading btw :)         2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Reverted the change to the handling of ZEND_BRK made by me on 2006-03-17 since it wasn't working as it should. Since this         reintroduces sf.net bug  #1442923  i added some code to prevent this bug using a different approach, by restoring operand types changed           by build_cfg if build_cfg exits with exit code 0.       Since php-5.1 some opcode handlers expect a strict set of operand types, anything else results in 'Invalid opcode' errors. Since           build_cfg changes some operand types these changes need to be reverted once the optimizer finishes. For now the only opcode to           which this all applies is ZEND_FETCH_CONSTANT, which expects either a CONST or a UNUSED in op1 and a CONST in op2 (See          zend_vm_def.h)         2006-04-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed some error introduced by fixing some win32 stuff :(   2006-04-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Moved the FLOCK stuff to a place so it can be used by eLoader to  Fixed quite some compile warnings on Win32  Updated VC6 project files   2006-03-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Removed the constant that were registered in the debug code. They could only be used in php code and not in the config file.

This does need some more testing, but           should fix sf.net bug  #1442923   Removed some dead code in ea_store.c and excluded some debug code from compilation in optimize.c   2006-03-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Included fcntl.h in ea_info.c, this should fix bug  #13    2006-03-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Set refcount to 1 before storing a zval in the usercache. This fixes bug  #4 .  Some formatting cleanups in cache.c  In restore_zval the zval length could be something else then 0 when an empty string was set.  Removed the shorttags in control.php and dasm.php to fix bug  #8 .  Set the svn keywords property to some files.  Moved some function defs from eaccelerator.h to the right files.   2006-03-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Removed the old webui and made a new controlpanel and disassembler.  Added php api documentation   2006-03-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Changed copyright dates to 2006  Updated the eaccelerator url in some last files  I removed all authors from specific files. Authors can be traced through mmcache and eaccelerator cvs. I did this because some          names should be added to quite some source files while others have added their own while contributing less then the once not mentoined. All contributors are credited in the AUTHORS file and specific information can be found in the Changelog and cvs.   2006-03-01  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Bunch of Win32 fixes.

The shared memory functions, session handler and content cache are disabled by default now. They are only used by a small amount of users and they could allow local users to fill up the memory, if they aren't secured properly.  The old web control panel and the disassembler have been removed from the code. They have been replaced with a set of php functions that allow the same functionality to be implemented in a PHP script. The control.php and the dasm.php files are such scripts. More information about this can be found in the README.  Memory footprint should be reduced because redundant information in the cached scripts is no longer stored. Keeping this information cached can be done with --with-eaccelerator-doc-comment-inclusion  File hashing in the cache directory has been added to improve performance with a large amount of cache files.    WARNING:  The encoder and loader DO NOT support php 5.1 nor php 5.0 and contain a lot of bugs for php 4. This is the last release in which the encoder/loader functionality will be available. Later a new encoder/loader might be included but there aren't any plans for that right now.     As always all patches and help are more than welcome.

This enables altering of session-related settings like       gc_maxlifetime, entropy_file and entropy_length through ini_set(). This fixes ticket  #166    2006-09-15  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Reverse changeset 205 (doc-comment exclusion) from Tom Regner <t.regner at librics.de>.   Some fixes to make eAccelerator compile with php 5.2, this fixes bug  #150   Restore  toString methods correctly with php 5.2  only put the function that has the same name as the class as contructor if there isn't a construct function. This fixes ticket  #172   Don't free memory with efree that has been allocated from the eA shm cache. This should fix A LOT of bugreports in Trac and on SF. It fixes  #171  but I think also some other bugs.   2006-08-29  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Skip disk cache creation and clean/clear actions when operating in shm_only mode. This fixes ticket  #165    2006-08-23  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fixes for tickets  #157  and  #164    2006-08-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fix stupid bug ( #159 )  Handle returning null instead of array ( #156 )   2006-08-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    zend_do_inheritance can't be called with TSRMLS_CC when using php 4, this also means that eAccelerator won't work with threading!   ea_info and ea_dasm: if eaccelerator_mm_instance is NULL, just return null and don't do something.   2006-07-30  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed detection of SysV IPC shared memory and made anonymous mmap the first selected type. This makes the behaviour of rc1 the default. anonymous mmap doens't have the problem of shmmax. SysVIPC is still available!   2006-07-27  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed project files for win32 and made the debug version build again.   2006-07-25  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fix restoring of opcode handler for php 5.0.5 when files are loaded from disk cache. This fixes bug  #147   Some update in the release notes for the upcoming rc1  Fix loader.c too so we don't get any linking errors.    2006-07-24  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Make clean routine support dir hashing. Again, this should be tested on win32!  Use a define for the magic string in the eAccelerator file headers  Bump up version to 0.9.5-rc1  Put -O2 back on for -rc1  Update the VC2005 project files  Add a config.w32 file for static building of eAccelerator   2006-07-24  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fix for ticket  #47  and  #63 , related to problems restoring empty strings and empty string array keys from the disk cache.   2006-07-23  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fix ticket  #143 , seems that PHP < 5 doesn't make the extension lower case.   2006-07-22  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Some zval macro's differ for php4 and 5, this fixes  #146 .  Also rewrite clean code for cache files on win32 for directory  hashing. This hasn't been tested on windows!!!  Added a script to create a bugreport file with more information about the user environment.   2006-07-19  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Use some more zval macro's to cleanup things a bit  Removed the code from mm.c that tried to allocate more then one segment  because it didn't work, this part needs a redesign of the mm code to  allow this. It should allocate one to init the shared memory and add the other to the free list.   2006-07-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Made some fixes to ea_info.c to make eA compile on windows again. This should fix bug  #116 .   2006-06-30  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Cleaned up the checking for other incompatible extensions a  bit. This should fix the use of  IonCube?  with eAccelerator. I did  some test loading  IonCube?  in different ways and never got in to  trouble. This fixes ticket  #66 .   2006-06-30  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Added ability to sort table columns by clicking on the table headings in the control panel  Quick & dirty fix for eaccelerator_clear to work with the new cache dir hashing. This still needs to be done for win32.       eaccelerator_clean still needs some fixing to work with the dir hashing.         2006-06-27  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed ifdef for  #108  to use only on windows  Fix for bug  #109 ,  #31  and SF-1102070  Cleaned-up RINIT a bit for hostname determining  Included the fix from ticket  #94  for zts   2006-06-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fix ticket  #108   Removed webui.[c|h] from the windows project files   2006-06-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fix for ticket  #101  ('bailout' is used in zend_globals.h in a ZTS build) as suggested by <ihanick at gmail dot com>   2006-06-02  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Removed two unused vars from the internal datastructures  Fixed constructor inheritance. This fixes handling of implicit constructors and solves ticket  #89    2006-05-14  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Forgot to remove some debug messages for the filter bug.   2006-05-08  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Make the disassembler do openbasedir checks before showing a file,  this fixes bug  #59   Changed the filter logic a bit, this fixes bug  #72    2006-05-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Added directory hashing for md5 and inode based keys based on a patch from <mattias at efterfesten.com>, default is 2 levels deep.  Renamed some left over MM based names to EA.  Increased default hash size for user and script to 512 for extra  performance.   2006-05-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Don't store the doc_comments in op_array and class_entry. They are  useless. this should reduce memory footprint.  Included patch from Stadler from ticket  #23 . It adds a nice menu  and code highlighting.   2006-04-13  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    When content cache is used also compiled shared memory functions   2006-04-11  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fix for 64-bit compilation warnings ""cast to pointer from integer of different size""   2006-04-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    A lot of fixes to silence the compile warnings generated when compiling with the default Fedora compiler options  Removed FC compiled options from Makefile.in again, stupid me   2006-04-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Silenced the unlock function for win32 until a windows developer can take a look at it.  Updated the README a little more for the new control panel  Added release notes for beta2  Bumped up version to 0.9.5-beta2  Patch for dasm.php form Stadler, see  #23   Fixed typo in optimizer which broke compilation for PHP != 5.1  Released beta2   2006-04-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed some typos in dasm.php  Added authentication to the disassembler   2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fixed handling of interfaces. This fixes sf.net bug  #1440575 .        This fix also introduces some changes in the cached object structure so remember to empty your disk caches if you have them. This is always a good thing to do after upgrading btw :)         2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Reverted the change to the handling of ZEND_BRK made by me on 2006-03-17 since it wasn't working as it should. Since this         reintroduces sf.net bug  #1442923  i added some code to prevent this bug using a different approach, by restoring operand types changed           by build_cfg if build_cfg exits with exit code 0.       Since php-5.1 some opcode handlers expect a strict set of operand types, anything else results in 'Invalid opcode' errors. Since           build_cfg changes some operand types these changes need to be reverted once the optimizer finishes. For now the only opcode to           which this all applies is ZEND_FETCH_CONSTANT, which expects either a CONST or a UNUSED in op1 and a CONST in op2 (See          zend_vm_def.h)         2006-04-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed some error introduced by fixing some win32 stuff :(   2006-04-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Moved the FLOCK stuff to a place so it can be used by eLoader to  Fixed quite some compile warnings on Win32  Updated VC6 project files   2006-03-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Removed the constant that were registered in the debug code. They could only be used in php code and not in the config file. This           handles bug  #29    2006-03-25  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Source code is now shown in dasm.php  Added source-code lines to the returned opcode array in ea_dasm.c   2006-03-21  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed bug  #24    2006-03-17  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fix for sf.net bug  #1442839  (handling of ZEND_ASSIGN_OBJ by the optimizer)  Changed BRK handling to not bail out of the optimizer prematurely on a multi-level break. This does need some more testing, but           should fix sf.net bug  #1442923   Removed some dead code in ea_store.c and excluded some debug code from compilation in optimize.c   2006-03-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Included fcntl.h in ea_info.c, this should fix bug  #13    2006-03-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Set refcount to 1 before storing a zval in the usercache. This fixes bug  #4 .  Some formatting cleanups in cache.c  In restore_zval the zval length could be something else then 0 when an empty string was set.  Removed the shorttags in control.php and dasm.php to fix bug  #8 .  Set the svn keywords property to some files.  Moved some function defs from eaccelerator.h to the right files.   2006-03-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Removed the old webui and made a new controlpanel and disassembler.  Added php api documentation   2006-03-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Changed copyright dates to 2006  Updated the eaccelerator url in some last files  I removed all authors from specific files. Authors can be traced through mmcache and eaccelerator cvs. I did this because some          names should be added to quite some source files while others have added their own while contributing less then the once not mentoined. All contributors are credited in the AUTHORS file and specific information can be found in the Changelog and cvs.   2006-03-01  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Bunch of Win32 fixes. It compiles cleanly now (tested with VC++ 6.0)  Fix to the optimizer for bug  #1439344   Fix to ea_store.c for a build problem on RHEL3 reported on the forums at  https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3596327    2006-02-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Changed the module entry url to eaccelerator.net and year  Removed the crash function  Disable the keys, session and content cache by default. These could result in a local DoS by cache poisioning  Release of eaccelerator 0.9.5-beta1   2006-02-24  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Altered the way debug output is in/excluded by adding a macro that makes sure calls to functions like  ea_debug_printf  don't get compiled in a non-debug build. The macro approach was chosen to prevent swamping the code with any more  ifdef  statements. This approach (as opposed to the previous empty-function-if-no-debug-build) also makes sure debug function arguments such as the tons of  getpid() 's (which don't come cheap) don't get compiled in and executed in a non-debug build.   2006-02-23  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Don't increase parent refcount in  restore_class_parent . This is wrong and leads to trouble in the Zend shutdown phase ( zend_destroy_class ). This most likely also fixes the  REMOVE_POINTER_FROM_LIST  segfault of bug  #1432758    2006-02-22  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Workaround for ""multiple definitions of symbol"" thread-safe build problem on Mac OS X. This fixes bug  #1407520    Renamed  mm_mutex  to  ea_mutex to avoid  confusion with eA's memory manager. This was probably a leftover of mmCache times.   2006-02-21  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Ditched the variadic macros. They were kinda useless now anyway since they were only passing one arg. This should make the Win32 folks happy since VC6 doesn't seem to support variadic macros. (It's a C99 thing.)   Removed some excessive debug output.   2006-02-20  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed bypassing  open_basedir  restriction when the file was already cached. This fixes bug  #1427719   Included patch  #1435196  to fix the problem of duplicate keys that don't get removed.   2006-02-20  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fixed  static_members  handling for PHP 5.0. Broke this while working on PHP 5.1 support. Lost in  ifdef  statements. ;)  Fixed ZE1 (<=PHP4) problem regarding parent class lookup during restore. Parent class name wasn't lowercased before lookup in  class_table . This also fixes bug  #1432758  (can't restore parent class "" stdClass "" of class xyz)   2006-02-19  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Restored PHP 4 compatibility  Fixed inheritance/prototype issue with abstract methods and classes during restore.  zend_do_inheritance  handles these properly now.   2006-02-18  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Bumped up version to 0.9.5-dev   2006-02-17  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>     * Merged PHP_5_1 branch with HEAD     2006-02-17  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    PHP_5_1: Some final fixes before merging to HEAD:  Fixed bug  #1410723  (handling of class constants by the optimizer)  Fixed backwards compatibility with PHP < 5.1     This revision works pretty well in my testing environment; PHP 5.1 support seems to be coming along quite well. Please test with your applications / in your environment and report back with your experiences or possible problems!       2006-02-15  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    PHP_5_1: Fixes for five failing tests found using the test suite created by Bart. Tests that failed where:  ctor_dtor_inheritance  (failed because  __construct ,  __destruct  and  __clone  were not properly set)  destructor_and_exceptions  (failed because inheritance of parent methods was broken, fixed by making sure  ea_store  doesn't store methods outside scope)  inheritance_002  (failed because  __construct ,  __destruct  and  __clone  were not properly set)  private_members  (failed because  __construct ,  __destruct  and  __clone  were not properly set)  type_hinting_003  (failed because  array_type_hint  introduced in  zend_arg_info  in PHP 5.1 was ignored)   2006-02-14  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip dot be>    PHP_5_1: Changed  cflags  to  -O2  from  -O3    2006-02-07  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    PHP_5_1: Fix for problems with  __autoload   PHP_5_1: Fixed compile problems with thread-safe PHP   2006-02-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    PHP_5_1: Several major changes, including but probably not limited to:  Fixed numerous memory leaks  Fixed the handling of empty string variables (as in """"), causing ""String is not zero-terminated"" warnings when PHP is compiled with  --enable-debug   More fixes to the handling of static properties (access checking/inheritance)  Inheritance on restore is now handled by  zend_do_inheritance   Fixed handling of  ZEND_OP_DATA  and  ZEND_INIT_METHOD_CALL  by the optimizer  Cosmetic fixes (spelling, etc.)   2006-01-16  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    PHP_5_1: Fix for bug  #1401474  (and most likely some more PHP 5.1-related trouble):  static_members  handling was incorrect.   2006-01-12  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    First batch of PHP 5.1-related changes committed to the newly created PHP_5_1 branch.

Since unlike most people at Sun my desktop machine also receives my email, and hosts both my home directory and calendar server, the switch-over needed some quiet concentration on my part to insure nothing important got left behind.       The installation of  Preview 2 (now available  here ) went smoothly  not surprising, since I'd tested many trial builds on the same machine, a 2 x 2.8GHz Ultra 40.  After installation completed and the machine rebooted, I created a second zpool with the two remaining drives; I use this for my home directory, mail spool, tunes and pkg server.  This isolates me from any difficulties with the new installer or possible future upgrade problems. ZFS of course makes this all very easy:       : barts@cyber[227]; zfs list  NAME                              USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT rpool                            2.63G   224G  49.5K  /rpool rpool@install                        0      -  49.5K  - rpool/ROOT                       2.62G   224G    18K  none rpool/ROOT@install                   0      -    18K  - rpool/ROOT/preview2              2.62G   224G  2.09G  legacy rpool/ROOT/preview2@install      66.8M      -  1.94G  - rpool/ROOT/preview2/opt           483M   224G   483M  /opt rpool/ROOT/preview2/opt@install    77K      -  3.61M  - rpool/export                     2.44M   224G    19K  /export rpool/export@install               15K      -    19K  - rpool/export/home                2.41M   224G  2.39M  /export/home rpool/export/home@install          19K      -    21K  - zfs                               177G  51.8G    21K  /zfs zfs/home                          133G  51.8G   133G  /export/home/cyber zfs/local                         291M  51.8G   291M  /usr/local zfs/mail                          110M  51.8G   110M  /var/mail zfs/music                        43.4G  51.8G  43.3G  /zfs/music zfs/music@2.1.2008               2.54M      -  42.3G  - zfs/repo                           18K  51.8G    18K  /zfs/repo : barts@cyber[228];     I then got to thinking about having a mirrored root pool; I hunted up one more 250GB drive, hot plugged it into the machine (love those SATA features) and used cfgadm -al and cfgadm -c to get Solaris to find the drive.  Zpool attach took care of establishing the mirror; the mirror was resilvered in just a few minutes since ZFS knows what's data and what's empty space.       Now I needed  dovecot , since I run an IMAP server to allow remote access of my mail.  Off to  dovecot.org  for  a tarball, download, configure and  hmm  no C compiler.   pkg search -r gcc  told me that I needed SUNWgcc installed, so  pkg install SUNWgcc  grabbed the compiler, assembler and binutils.  Cool.  Run configure again and whoops  no headers!   pkg search -r stdlib.h  said I needed SUNWhea, so pkg install SUNWhea and I was compiling dovecot.... For a quick look at the packages available in Indiana so far browse over to  http://pkg.opensolaris.org .  I wrote this blog post using openoffice  which you'll find in a package called openoffice.    Indiana and IPS are usable, but we've still got a lot work to do:       The  packages need to be re-factored into smaller pieces and renamed and  tagged to better support minimization, searching, etc.    The  command line pkg interface needs some attention...    and  here's still much work to be done in constraints, simplifying pkg  publishing and there are lots of bugs, tracebacks and other issues  to address.               However, it's coming together  and being able to  upgrade  from preview2 from preview1 without running any postinstall scripts helps use feel better about the  assertions  that started the project....

B  is for  break , to jump out of this rot.   C  is for  continue , to jump to the top of one's loops.   D  is for  default , the case that handles the oops.   E  is for  else , the predicate's inversion.   F  is for  for , of  the loops the most popular version.   G  is for  goto , a jump oft considered dubious.   H  is for  hardware , for profits salubrious.   I  is for  if , a conditional statement.   J  is for  jmpl , an indirect jump causing performance abatement.   K  is for  thousands  in powers of two.   L  is for  long , whose size recently grew.   M  is for  membar , whose use can confound.   N  is for  NOP , which in delay slots often is found.   O  is for  operator , whose overloading is oft unsupportable.   P  is for  pragma , with usage unportable.   Q  is for  quadword , the largest of all.   R  is for  return , when we make the stack not so tall.   S  is for  switch , a computed goto for which we all yearn.   T  is for  trap , from which we may never return.   U  is for  unsigned , to avoid two's complement extension.   V  is for  volatile , whose presence incites apprehension.   W  is for  WSTATE register , for window traps most topical.   X  is for  XOR , bitwise not logical.   Y  is for  Y register , deprecated for years.   Z  is for  zero , whose dereferencing everyone fears.

Patches are a separate software change control mechanism distinct from package versions in Solaris.  Each patch may affect portions of several packages; patches are intended to include all the files necessary to fix one or more problems, either directly or by specifying dependencies.  If a patch affects packages which are not installed on this system (typically because it has been  minimized ), those portions of the patch are not installed.  If the administrator later adds the missing package, he must remember (good luck) to re-apply the patches since the packaging code knows nothing of patches. Customers are today free to install which ever patches they feel are appropriate for their environment, consistent with the built-in dependency requirements.  This customization is a technique I refer to as  Dim Sum  patching, and is a major cause of patching difficulties.  Many customers pick and choose amongst the thousands of patches available for Solaris 10, for example; this means that customers are often pioneering new configurations.  Note that each Solaris release consists of a single source base; all Solaris 10 updates, for example, are but snapshots of the same Solaris patch gate at different times.  As a result, the developers are working on a cumulative  set of all previous changes; when a new patch is created, the files in the patch not only contain the desired fix, but all previous fixes as well.  Thus, the software change is constructed as a linear stream of change, but customers installs selected binaries from the various builds via patches.   When I've discussed the hazards of  Dim Sum patching with customers, the reasons given are typically characterizable as :     we don't need all those patches,  we don't have those drivers loaded we're reducing downtime by not installing so many patches the less change, the less risk. To these, I reply: If you don't need those drivers, then remove them them w/ pkgrm rather than leaving them in an unpatched state awaiting the introduction of new hardware or software to expose problems.  Minimization, not spotty patching, is the answer.  This is akin to disposing of an unused car, rather than simply leaving it unmaintained. Today, you should be using Live Upgrade and patching the alternate boot image to reduce downtime.  This allows machines in production to be safely patched, and will not leave the system in an inconsistent or unbootable state in the case of power failure during patching operations.  In the future, the new packaging system will always patch a clone of the current system to avoid the potential for disaster in case of power failure. Our experience has been that customers running all of the changes in an update are generally far less likely to experience problems than those who select only the fixes and features that appeal to them, and hope that our QA processes found all hidden dependencies on previous changes. For our new packaging system, there is a powerful incentive to eliminate Dim Sum patching:  since we wish to use a single version numbering space for any package, attempting to support fine-grain Dim Sum patching would require very small packages - affecting the performance of packaging operations, and significantly increasing the workload of OpenSolaris developers.   Instead, we can set package boundaries according to what makes sense for minimization purposes.   This implies that future (post Solaris 11) patches will be completely cumulative (aside from some exceptions for urgent security fixes), at least for the core OS.  Your system will be able to determine what is needed to bring the installed software up to the desired revision level automatically; needing to pick and choose patches will be a thing of the past.                                                  Posted at                   03:56PM Jul 25, 2007              by barts in  packaging and patching   |                                           Comments[10]                                                                       Friday Jun 01, 2007                                     Friday afternoon SPARKFUN                                          Mike Pogue mentioned he was considering using a USB-connected PIC controller to drive some stepper motors from a PC.  He'd ordered out a  USB Bit Wacker  , which plugs right into a USB port and looks like a serial port to the host OS, and gives you 14 ports that can either be digital in, out or analog in.  The host sends simple ASCII commands down, and the Bit Whacker sends back status/port data. Cool!  Earlier this afternoon, he brought it in and we plugged it into my Tyan whitebox running Nevada 64a using a mini-USB cable.  I was running a tail -f on /var/adm/messages, and saw: Jun  1 15:29:34 cyber usba: [ID 912658 kern.info] USB 2.0 device (usb4d8,a) operating at full speed (USB 1.x) on USB 1.10 root hub: communications@1, usb_mid6 at bus address 3 Jun  1 15:29:34 cyber usba: [ID 349649 kern.info]       Microchip Technology Inc.

Here's a picture of the device: (The picture was taken w/ my Razr 3i and uploaded using Solaris as well.... )                                                    Posted at                   06:31PM Jun 01, 2007              by barts in  General   |                                                                                   Wednesday Jan 17, 2007                                     New home server                                          Building a new household server....    Like a lot of families these days, our household IT infrastructure has had to adapt as we all became more and more fond of computers for work, school and recreation.  With digital photograpy, ripping hundreds of CDs, describing our various activities and travels on web pages,  two teenagers and the heavy use of email, and the need to provide stable storage for homework and digital art, we've been playing catchup for a while.  This led us directly to designing and building a new server to handle storage of all the digital media, web-serving and email.  At the same time, I was tired of the whine from the surplus X1 rack-mount server I had stuffed in the closet, and decided to merge my home desktop and server together to reduce power consumption.  With some thinking we arrived at the following hardware design:         Tyan 2865 motherboard  - 4 SATA ports that worked w/ Solaris in compatibility mode, sound and an on-board nvidia gigabit ethernet chip, both supported by Solaris as these were the motherboards in the original Ultra 20s.           2 x 2.6 GHZ AMD CPU ; this was rather more CPU than I originally planned, but sometimes things turn up...     1 GB ECC RAM, later upgraded to 2 GB.      4 x 500 GB Seagate drives for redundant data storage, plus a leftover 40GB IDE drive for root and a DVD-RW drive for movies and burning DVDs.     NVIdia 6600 GT video card - available for a reasonable price and with good 3D graphics for playing with those video game ports to Solaris.  With the bundled NVidia OpenGL drivers in 55, the cool screen savers work out of the box, too!         450 W Antec power supply     inexpensive second NIC for our external interface; I happened to have an $7 Gb Airlink card which uses the Realtek part; this works out of the box as well.          A small case - I used an Antec Lanboy as they're small and light.  In retrospect, a larger case such as an Antec P180 would have been a better choice.  I do like the disk cooling on this design, though - the 120 MM (blue, heh) fan keeps the drive temps very moderate.        Well, this went together pretty easily (especially since I had my son do all the work...).  The software selection and configuration was actually considerably more effort than picking the hardware components and building the system.  We're now running:        Solaris Nevada build 55     the bundled Bind 9 for handling internal, DMZ and external views of our various domains.         the bundled Apache 2.2 handles our various web pages and our 3 virtual domains.         the bundled dhcp server handles DHCP service.  I configured this with dhcpmgr; since all the other machines in the house use DHCP there's little admin work to do anywhere else.  This is a real boon during the kid's LAN parties; things just work. The bundled Samba server provides NAS for the various Microsoft and Mac clients in the house.  With the latest OS-X builds, NFS works well enough to use; we may switch.  I use swat to configure Samba.         Printing is provided by the stock lp and ipp-listeners aided by Samba for the kid's microsoft game platforms.  I configured this with printmgr.  We print to an HP1200 that has worked flawlessly for years w/ just a couple of toner changes.          the bundled IPFilter provides carefully controlled port filtering on both the external and internal network interfaces.         Dovecot  (compiled from source) provides IMAP service for both our LAN and (with SSL) over the Internet.  This service is under SMF control so it starts automatically when the machine boots. I chose Dovecot since it also cooperates with Postfix to handle SMTP authentication.         Postfix  (compiled from source + Berkeley DBM libraries).  This provides SMTP service with TLS and AUTH needed to control relaying by family members using external connections.  The anti-SPAM features are also excellent and pretty easy to setup given the numerous how-to guides available on the web.  With Postfix I feel actually in control; I always had to rely on  John Beck  to customize my sendmail configuration.          The unbundled SUNcry{r} encryption packages were needed to get the bundled OpenSSL libraries working correctly w/ TLS and Thunderbird. Darren Moffat promises to have the high grade support bundled into OpenSolaris soon.    So far things are working very well.  The 4x500 GB drives are in a RAID-Z configuration with ZFS; we can sustain 120 MB/sec or so reading or writing to the 20 odd filesystems configured on the single pool.  Samba works pretty well; we managed to feed 10 different files to 10 different clients at nearly 100Mb/sec apiece during one of the kids' Lan parties.  Dovecot in particular seems very fast on top of ZFS, and other than a glitch with my forgetting to set the maximum user mailbox size Postfix has been trouble free.  I use this machine as my desktop as well in the evenings.   What are we still thinking about changing? Well:          My son wants a  Ventrilo  audio server for his Guild Wars games.  Another manifest, some more testing.         I may add greylisting to our SPAM prevention techniques; this will require a bit more configuration work. We reject perhaps 700 SPAM emails per day for our small number of email users; we each still get a handleful each day.     I'm going to add a  Slim Devices Squeezebox  to our stereo system; we outgrew the 200 CD changer some time ago.  That's another server to run, but we get access to the 65+ GB of music anywhere in the house.          I'm thinking about adding a separate Ethernet interface to plug in the wireless router  This will let me experiment with more secure ways to configure wireless services.     When ZFS root and boot is supported , I'll configure another pair of drives for a mirrored root pool using a SI3114 card. Right now we just back up the small root partition to our ZFS pool.

We don't yet support booting ZFS quite yet, so some of the ideas below will have to wait a bit for implementation - but it's certainly time to start thinking about them.      First of all, in years past we've been moving more and more to the ""one giant filesystem"" model for installing systems; it's just been to much of a PITA to anticipate how much space we might need for root, var, opt, usr, etc.... but now with ZFS divorcing space allocation from  filesystem boundaries, it's easy to use separate filesystems to make administration easier. It's ok to use lots of filesystems - they're essentially free, and since snapshots are at the filesystem level, filesystems also the ""undo"" boundary.  Clearly, we don't want to  delivery of mail or the growth of logs from inhibiting one from rolling back a ill-considered change to other parts of the system, so separating directories that contain files that are modified ""automatically"" from those that containing binaries or configuration files seems like a good idea.     Once this separation occurs, using zfs rollback to undo the effects of changes such as a ill-considered patch or administrative actions becomes simple.  It also appears that Live Upgrade could be a lot easier with ZFS - just snapshot and clone the filesystems being upgraded. Perhaps we should take snapshots always before adding a patch... hmmm, given that we have ZFS, how would we redesign patching if we could always use ZFS for root filesystems?      Another area of possible change is initial installation.  Right now we use bzip2 compression on on each package on the install media to compress our packages into the smallest possible footprint; this has been needed in order to fit localization information onto the first CD.  Since we access the CD/DVD as a filesystem and then uncompress the package as it's being installed, we often have trouble reading data fast enough from the install media to keep the device spun up at anywhere near full speed, esp. for small packages.  With zfs compression, we could store a ZFS filesystem image on the CD/DVD and stream that onto a ZFS filesystem on the hard disk in one (fast)shot,  and then install packages from the hard disk as needed.  Afterwards the extra packages could be deleted, or left there to facilitate later installation of additional components; disk space is amazingly cheap these days.      Another area of interest is providing backups.  ZFS makes it very easy to determine the differences between snapshots; this makes doing incremental updates of even very large slightly modified filesystems inexpensive in terms of disk and CPU utilization.  It sure would be nice if my Ferrari laptop could just upload it's changes since the last backup automatically when I plugged it into the building nets; yes, I could do that today, but without the smarts of ZFS, traversing a 50GB data set to see what has changed just isn't very  practical on the slow laptop drives.       There are more ideas to consider, but it's clear that today is just the beginning of the ZFS revolution; ZFS  will  change the way Solaris works.

LibMicro is a set of portable OS (kernel/library) benchmarks developed as part of the Solaris 10 performance effort.

You can find libMicro in the  performance community   at  opensolaris.org .     There's still a lot to do on libMicro, starting with documentation on how to add new benchmarks, and how the whole thing works... but that will have to wait until I'm back from a brief vacation.

Often this is because the default compilation mode using /usr/sfw/bin/gcc (or Studio, for that matter)  on Solaris is always a portable binary - and 64 bit Solaris x86 isn't seen as a different architecture, since all the 32 bit programs still work just fine.  So    gcc -o foo foo.c      produces a 32 bit binary on Solaris amd64, and a 64 bit binary when compiled on a 64 bit Linux.  No wonder there's a performance difference!  To get 64 bit compilation using gcc, simply use the -m64 flag:    gcc -o foo foo.c -m64     When in doubt, specify what you want - you'll more likely get what you need.

Since Solaris  is  the code, not being able to show people the code has been like having a discussion about various aspects of the flavors of wine without actually tasting any - possible perhaps, but a rather dry (heh) and uninteresting narrative....   I was happily (as I don't get to write nearly enough code) whacking away on a revised version of  malloc  to fix some longstanding performance and scalabilty issues when one of our marketing folks darted in asking about telcos, real time, and latency bubbles [I'll write about our malloc findings later on]. After getting the relevant email trail and a test program from the customer contact, it turned out that indeed the customer was seeing a real problem - 20 millisecond timers was apparently firing up to 60 microseconds late occasionally on his Opteron box, but no problem was seen on SPARC machines. What's weirder, this problem appeared sometimes, but not always - any given instance of the test program might display the problem, or it might not.  Hmmm.   The customer's test program would carefully store information about intervals between timer firings that exceeded 40 usecs +  20 msecs and report them every 20 seconds or so... and when the problem appeared, it was happening once a second...     Like most performance problems I run into, this looked like a job for  DTrace.   As  Bryan  has pointed out many times, DTrace is best at quickly evaluating various hypotheses...so I needed some testable ideas as to what might be going on. Well, what could make the program's timers fire late?         Other threads or interrupts - perhaps these are interfering with our program somehow?     Other timers firing on this cpu.  Maybe some other system timers are causing problems on CPU 1?      Well, hypothesis testing time.  First of all, the test program clearly created a processor set containing CPU 1 and placed itself as the only thread in that set.  It even disabled interrupts on that CPU.  A quick check with the following script:       on-cpu /curcpu->cpu_id == 1/ {         trace(curthread); }  verified that there was only a single thread (the expected one) running on CPU 1.  Hmmm.  interstat verified that  CPU 1 wasn't getting any device interrupts, either.  So what's happening here? I had some experience with  time keeping on Solaris, but not enough to know offhand where to look for this problem.  Confused?  DTrace will help!  A quick change to the above script lets us use the enqueue probe in the sched provider to discover exactly how our process is made runnable when the timer expires:     sched:::enqueue /curcpu->cpu_id == 1/ {         stack(10); }  The output is pretty straightforward - lots of entries that look like this:    1   2561                setbackdq:enqueue               TS`ts_setrun+0xf1               genunix`cv_unsleep+0x6e               genunix`setrun_locked+0x6d               genunix`eat_signal+0x89               genunix`sigtoproc+0x420               genunix`sigaddqa+0x4a               genunix`timer_fire+0xb9               genunix`clock_highres_fire+0x3f               genunix`cyclic_softint+0xb2               unix`cbe_low_level+0x14  This gave me a place to get started.... timer_fire is clearly important, so let's instrument that and see when it fires:     #pragma D option quiet BEGIN {         start = timestamp;     last = timestamp; } fbt::timer_fire:entry {         printf(""%d: interval is %d usecs late\n"",                 (timestamp - start)/1000,                 (int) (((timestamp - last) - 20000000))/1000);         last = timestamp; }  This script just prints a line with a timestamp in microseconds since we started, with the number of microseconds late (more than the 20 msec) interval that was desired.    Interestingly enough, the output looks like this:   13822657: interval is 0 usecs late 13842656: interval is 0 usecs late 13862657: interval is 0 usecs late 13882657: interval is 0 usecs late 13902657: interval is 0 usecs late 13922599: interval is -57 usecs late 13942657: interval is 57 usecs late 13962657: interval is 0 usecs late 13982657: interval is 0 usecs late 14002657: interval is 0 usecs late  Whoops!  Turns out our test program was leading us down the garden path; the problem is that one timer fire appears to be early, and the next one makes up the difference; the net error is 0 over time.  Reading the comments in  cyclic.c , this isn't that surprising but does give us a place to start looking. At this point, I noticed that I can suspend the test program and still get the same intermittant late behavior. How often are we late?    #pragma D option quiet BEGIN {         start = timestamp;     last = timestamp; } fbt::timer_fire:entry /(int) (((timestamp - last) - 20000000))/1000 != 0/ {         printf(""%d: interval is %d usecs late\n"",                 (timestamp - start)/1000,                 (int) (((timestamp - last) - 20000000))/1000); } fbt::timer_fire:entry {         last = timestamp; } 5974796: interval is -57 usecs late 5994854: interval is 56 usecs late 6974796: interval is -57 usecs late 6994854: interval is 56 usecs late  Interesting - once a second.    Reading the  cyclic.c  source code we see that cyclic_fire handles all the interesting timer stuff.  Let's trace cyclic_fire in addition to timer_fire:  2248600: interval is 0 usecs late 2263098: cyclic_fire 2268539: cyclic_fire 2268543: interval is -57 usecs late 2288597: cyclic_fire 2288600: interval is 57 usecs late  So did we misprogram the clock, or is something else going on?  On line 929 ofcyclic.c, we see that we reprogram the interrupt source through a function pointer. Those are a pain.

Rats, calling through another function pointer.  Ok, this time we'll use DTrace to figure out where we're going rather than mdb:       cbe_reprogram:entry /curcpu->cpu_id == 1/ {         self->trace = 1; } fbt:::entry, fbt:::return /self->trace/ { } cbe_reprogram:return /curcpu->cpu_id == 1/ {         self->trace = 0; }   1  -> cbe_reprogram   1    -> apic_timer_reprogram   1      -> gethrtime   1        -> tsc_gethrtime   1   <- tsc_gethrtime   1      <- gethrtime   1    <- apic_timer_reprogram   1  <- cbe_reprogram  Ok, now let's look at the source for  apic_timer_reprogram        ticks = (uint_t)((time - now) / apic_nsec_per_tick);  This is introducing a .4 % error... I wonder what the value of apic_nsecs_per_tick really is?      # echo 'apic_nsec_per_tick/D' | mdb -k  apic_nsec_per_tick: apic_nsec_per_tick:             10    That's it. We're suffering from an imprecise conversion between nsecs and apic ticks; the appropriate value cannot be represented as an integer with this conversion accurately enough to keep excessive jitter from appearing.  Since the deadman cyclic runs every second, if we want to keep worst case jitter due to quantization errors down to 1 usec we'll need 1 ppm resolution on the conversion factor.     This also explained why sometimes the bug isn't visible - if the a 20 msec cyclic always occurs just before the deadman cyclic fires, there is almost no change in the amount of time between cyclic firings.    At this point I filed a bug,  6266961.   The fix involves rewriting the conversion to use a different factor and redoing the calibration of the apic timer to use the kernel's idea of hi-res time rather than the pit timer.    /*  * deal with resolution issues by converting between ticks and  * nanoseconds using 64 bit math.  * use multiplication cause it's faster; divide by power of 2  * for speed.  */ static int64_t  apic_ticks_per_128Mnsecs; /* ticks/128*1024*1024 nsecs */ #define APIC_TICKS_TO_NSECS(ticks) (((long long)(ticks) * 134217728LL)/\     apic_ticks_per_128Mnsecs) #define APIC_NSECS_TO_TICKS(nsecs) ((long long)(nsecs) * \     apic_ticks_per_128Mnsecs / 134217728LL)  After I get this finished up, it's back to malloc... more about that later on.

As part of the Solaris 10 developer BOF at Usenix a couple of weeks ago,    Liane  asked me to put together a quick DTrace demo, so I  cons'ed  up a quick example of how to put static probes into an application. This technique is simple and can avoid the need for debug flags, conditional logging, etc in the application.     In order to have something to work with, I wrote a quick version of wc that I instrumented with two dtrace probe points.  These two probe points are defined in a file called simple_probes.d:    provider simple {  probe saw__word(int);  probe saw__line(int); };    Note that dtrace treats double underscores specially in such definitions; they're converted to dash ""-"" characters in the finished probe names. Here's the source for the wc program, which I called simple.c:      #include <stdio.h>   #include <sys/sdt.h>     /*    * simple example of defining sdt probes in a trivial program    * Sdt probes can often completely replace debug levels, optional    * log files, etc, in daemons... you can leverage the power of dtrace    * to make your server/application more readily debuggable.    */     int   main(int argc, char *argv[])   {           int i;           int characters, lines, words;           characters = lines = words = 0;               while (1) {                     if ((i = getchar()) == EOF) {                           /*                            * here we specify the name of the module,                            * the name of the probe (modulo mapping                            * '__' to '-') and pass in the parameter to be                            * traced which in this case is the number of                            * lines seen so far.                            */                           DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__line, lines);                           break;                   }                     characters++;                     if (i == '\n') {                           lines++;                           DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__line, lines);                           continue;                   }                     if (isblank(i)) /* eating white space */                           continue;                     words++; /* in a word now */                     while (1) {                             if ((i = getchar()) == EOF) {                                   DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__word, words);                                   break;                           }                             characters++;                             if (i == '\n') { /* EOL? ends word implicitly */                                   DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__word, words);                                   lines++;"

The      hierarchical level of the cache memory for each processor is stored in a      rewritable hierarchy setting register. Each processor handles a cache      memory corresponding to another processor as the cache memory having a      deeper hierarchy than the cache memory corresponding to the each      processor. As the result, each processor can access all the cache      memories, and therefore the efficiency of cache memory utilization can be      improved and the hierarchical level can be set so that the latency      becomes optimal for each application.

Description:   CROSS -REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION  [0001] This application is a Continuation Application of International      Application No. PCT/JP2006/304146, filed Mar. 3, 2006, designating the      U.S., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  BACKGROUND   [0002] 1. Field  [0003] The present embodiments relate to a multiprocessor system and a      method of operating the multiprocessor system.  [0004] 2. Description of the Related Art  [0005] Generally, in a processor system, a method is employed in which a      high-speed cache memory is installed between a processor and a main      memory, i.e., a main memory unit, in order to balance the operating      speeds between the processor and the main memory. Moreover, in a system      requiring high processing capabilities, a multiprocessor system using a      plurality of processors is used. In the multiprocessor system, for      example, a cache memory installed in the multiprocessor system, in which      a plurality of processors accesses data of a main memory via the cache      memory, is provided corresponding to each of the processors. This cache      memory is accessed from all the processors with a fixed access priority      given for each processor (e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent Application      Publication No. H6-202949).  [0006] In a conventional multiprocessor system with a cache memory      corresponding to each processor, each cache memory is accessed from all      the processors, so that the efficiency of cache memory utilization is      excellent. However, since the access priority (hierarchical level) to      each cache memory is fixed, a delay time (latency) after the processor      requests access to the cache memory until it receives data may be      increased. For example, even when the hierarchical level for achieving      the optimal latency differs for each application to be used, the      hierarchical level of the cache memory is fixed. For this reason, the      latency may increase depending on the application. Moreover, when the      shared data accessed by a plurality of processors is present in any one      of the cache memories, the transfer of the data to other cache memories      might reduce the latency further. Even in this case, the data cannot be      transferred between the cache memories, so that the latency will not be      reduced.  SUMMARY   [0007] According to one aspect of embodiments, a multiprocessor system is      provided which includes a multiprocessor system, including a plurality of      processors, a plurality of cache memories having a different hierarchical      level for each processor and being shared by the processors, a rewritable      hierarchy setting register storing a hierarchical level of the cache      memory, and an access control unit controlling access between each cache      memory in accordance with the hierarchical level set in the hierarchy      setting register.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS   [0020] Hereinafter, the present embodiments will be described using the      accompanying drawings.  [0021] FIG. 1 shows one embodiment. A multiprocessor system includes      processors P0, P1, and P2, cache memories C0, C1, C2, and C3, an access      control unit ACNT, a hierarchy setting register LREG, a transfer setting      register TREG, a replacement setting register RREG, and a main memory MM.      Each of the cache memories C0-C3 has each of tags TGO-TG3, respectively.      The processors P0, P1, and P2 are directly coupled to the cache memories      C0, C1, and C2, respectively. The cache memories C0, C1, and C2 are      coupled to the access control unit ACNT. The access control unit ACNT is      coupled to the hierarchy setting register LREG, the transfer setting      register TREG, the replacement setting register RREG, the cache memory      C3, and the main memory MM. The main memory MM is coupled to the cache      memory C3. LRU (Least Recently Used) data is recorded in each of tags      TG0-TG3 of each of the cache memories C0-C3. Here, the LRU data is data      for selecting a cache line having the longest unused time. The registers      LREG, TREG, and RREG described above are rewritable. By rewriting to a      setting appropriate for each application, it is always possible to reduce      the latency without depending on the application.  [0022] FIG. 2 shows a hierarchical level of each of the cache memories      C0-C3 when viewed from the processors P0-P2. The hierarchical levels of      the cache memories C0-C3 shown in FIG. 2 are set in the hierarchy setting      register LREG shown in FIG. 1. The access control unit ACNT controls      access between each of the cache memories C0-C3 in accordance with the      hierarchical level set in the hierarchy setting register LREG. The      hierarchical levels of the cache memories C0, C1, C2, and C3 when viewed      from the processor P0 are level 1, level 2, level 2, and level 3,      respectively. The hierarchical levels of the cache memories C0, C1, C2,      and C3 when viewed from the processor P1 are level 2, level 1, level 2,      and level 3, respectively. The hierarchical levels of the cache memories      C0, C1, C2, and C3 when viewed from the processor P2 are level 2, level      2, level 1, and level 3, respectively. Since the processors P0-P2 can      access all the cache memories C0-C3, the efficiency of cache memory      utilization can be improved. Moreover, the processors P0-P2 are provided      with the cache memories of level 2 and level 3. Thereby, the chances to      access the main memory MM can be reduced and the latency can be reduced.  [0023] FIG. 3 shows transfer conditions (conditions for determining whether      to move, copy, or keep) of a cache line at which a cache hit was      generated in the cache memory of a lower hierarchy. The transfer      conditions shown in FIG. 3 are set in the transfer setting register TREG      shown in FIG. 1. In accordance with the conditions set in the transfer      setting register TREG, the access control unit ACNT controls a cache line      at which a cache hit was generated in the cache memory of a lower      hierarchy. When the value of the LRU data indicates the last-used data      (latest data), the cache memories C0-C2 keep the cache line without      moving it When the value of the LRU data indicates other than the latest      data, the cache memories C0-C2 move the cache line (do not copy this).      When other processors continue to use the cache line, the cache line is      moved in accordance with the transfer conditions shown in FIG. 3 and the      cache line is registered with an appropriate cache memory. As a result,      the latency can be reduced. The cache memory C3 copies the cache line      regardless of the value of the LRU data.  [0024] FIG. 4 shows the conditions (hereafter, also referred to as      replacement conditions) for determining whether to move a cache line,      which overflowed from a cache memory of a higher hierarchy when the cache      line was registered, to other cache memories, to write the same to the      main memory MM, or to discard the same. The replacement conditions shown      in FIG. 4 are set in the replacement setting register RREG shown in FIG.      1. In accordance with the conditions set in the replacement setting      register RREG, the access control unit ACNT controls the cache line that      overflowed from the cache memory of the higher hierarchy. The replacement      conditions of the cache memories C0, C1, C2, and C3 are ""discard"",      ""move"", ""move"", and ""discard"", respectively. Since the replacement      condition of a cache line can be set for each cache memory in this      manner, the latency can be reduced by rewriting to a setting appropriate      for each application. For example, under the replacement conditions of      FIG. 4, when a certain processor accesses a cache line that overflowed      from the cache memories C1, C2, this cache line is currently registered      with other cache memories, and therefore the processor does not need to      access to the main memory MM. As a result, the latency can be reduced.  [0025] FIG. 5 shows an update procedure of the LRU data. The update      procedure of the LRU data shown in FIG. 5 is set in the transfer setting      register TREG shown in FIG. 1. Hereinafter, the update procedure of the      LRU data when a cache hit was generated in a cache memory of a lower      hierarchy is described as an example. When the value of the LRU data      corresponding to a cache line at which a cache hit was generated is the      ""latest"", the cache memories C0, C1, and C2 replace the value of the LRU      data with the ""second"" from the ""latest"" (column of ""LRU latest"" shown in      FIG. 5). As a result, the value of the LRU data corresponding to the      second recently used cache line is set to the ""latest"", and the value of      the LRU data corresponding to the most recently used cache line is set to      the ""second"". In the conventional update procedure, the value of the LRU      data corresponding to the second recently used cache line is set to the      ""second"". When the value of the LRU data corresponding to a cache line at      which a cache hit was generated is not the ""latest"", the cache line is      moved to the cache memory of level 1 and thereafter the value of the LRU      data is set to the ""latest"" (column of ""other than LRU latest"" shown in      FIG. 5). The cache memory C3 sets the value of the LRU data to the      ""latest"" regardless of the value of the LRU data. In this embodiment, the      LRU data is updated so that the transfer conditions shown in FIG. 4 may      work.  [0026] Moreover, when the replacement of a cache line occurs and a cache      line that overflowed from a higher hierarchy is registered with the cache      memory of a lower hierarchy, the cache memories C0-C2 set to the ""oldest""      the value of the LRU data to which the cache line is to be assigned      (column of ""replacement"" of FIG. 5). The cache memory C3 will not change      the value of the LRU data to which the cache line is to be assigned      (column of ""replacement"" of FIG. 5). Here, the ""oldest"" of the value of      the LRU data implies the first-used cache line (a cache line having the      longest unused time).  [0027] FIG. 6 shows an example of the operation of the multiprocessor      system of FIG. 1. The addresses X, Y indicate addresses in the main      memory MM of FIG. 1. The operation shown in FIG. 6 will be described with      a case where the data of the address X is not registered yet with the      cache memories C0-C3 and the data of the address Y is already registered      with the cache memory C3, as an example.  [0028] First, in operation S100, the processor P0 issues a read request for      the address X to the cache memory C0 (level 1). The cache memory C0      results in a cache miss. The cache memory C0 notifies the access control      unit ACNT of the cache miss. The access control unit ACNT issues a read      request for the address X to the cache memory C1 (level 2) and the cache      memory C2 (level 2) in accordance with the hierarchy set in the hierarchy      setting register LREG. The cache memories C1, C2 result in a cache miss.      The cache memories C1, C2 notify the access control unit ACNT of the      cache miss. The access control unit ACNT issues a read request for the      address X to the cache memory C3 (level 3). The cache memory C3 results      in a cache miss. The cache memory C3 notifies the access control unit      ACNT of the cache miss.  [0029] Since the cache memory having a lower hierarchy than the cache      memory C3 is currently not set in the hierarchy setting register LREG,      the access control unit ACNT issues a read request for the address X to      the main memory MM. The access control unit ACNT reads from the main      memory MM a cache-line size of data including the address X. The access      control unit ACNT transfers the cache line including the read data to the      cache memories C0, C3. The cache memory C3 is used as a shared cache      memory of the lowermost layer in the processors P0-P2. For this reason,      the cache line read from the main memory MM is also registered with the      cache memory C3. The cache memories C0, C3 check the value of the LRU      data to which the cache line sent from the access control unit ACNT is to      be assigned. The cache memories C0, C3 drive out a cache line having the      ""oldest"" value of the LRU data and register the sent cache line. The      cache memory C0 returns the data of the address X to the processor P0.  [0030] Since the replacement condition of the replacement setting register      RREG of the cache memories C0, C3 is ""discard"", the access control unit      ACNT discards a cache line overflowed from the cache memories C0, C3.      However, when the cache line overflowed from the cache memory C0 is      ""dirty"", the access control unit ACNT moves the cache line overflowed      from the cache memory C0 to the cache memory C3. Here, the ""dirty""      indicates a state where only data present in a cache memory of a higher      hierarchy is updated but the data present in a cache memory of a lower      hierarchy or in the main memory MM is not yet updated. The cache memory      C3 checks the value of the LRU data to which a cache line sent from the      cache memory C0 is to be assigned. The cache memory C3 drives out a cache      line having the ""oldest"" value of the LRU data and registers a cache line      sent from the cache memory C0. The cache memory C3 sets the registered      cache line to ""dirty"". When a cache line overflowed from the cache memory      C3 is ""dirty"", the access control unit ACNT writes this cache line to the      main memory MM.  [0031] In operation S110, the processor P1 issues a read request for the      address X to the cache memory C1 (level 1). The cache memory C1 results      in a cache miss. The cache memory C1 notifies the access control unit      ACNT of the cache miss. The access control unit ACNT issues a read      request for the address X to the cache memories C0, C2 (level 2). The      cache memory C0 results in a cache hit. The cache memory C0 notifies the      access control unit ACNT of the cache hit. The access control unit ACNT      checks the value of the LRU data of a cache line at which a cache hit was      generated, and the transfer condition of the transfer setting register      TREG. Since the value of the LRU data indicates the ""latest"", the access      control unit ACNT keeps the cache line at which the cache hit was      generated without moving it. The access control unit ACNT returns the      data of the address X to the processor P1 from the cache memory C0 via      the cache memory C1. The cache memory C0 sets the value of the LRU data      of the cache line at which the cache hit was generated to the ""second"".      For example, if the processor P0 issues a read request for the address X      again before operation S120, the data of the address X is still      registered with the cache memory C0 (level 1), and therefore the latency      can be reduced.  [0032] In operation S120, the processor P1 issues again a read request for      the address X to the cache memory C1 (level 1). The cache memory C1      results in a cache miss. The cache memory C1 notifies the access control      unit ACNT of the cache miss. The access control unit ACNT issues a read      request for the address X to the cache memories C0, C2 (level 2). The      cache memory C0 results in a cache hit. The cache memory C0 notifies the      access control unit ACNT of the cache hit. The access control unit ACNT      checks the value of the LRU data of a cache line at which the cache hit      was generated, and the transfer condition of the transfer setting      register TREG. Since the value of the LRU data indicates the ""second"",      the access control unit ACNT moves the cache line at which the cache hit      was generated to the cache memory C1 (level 1). The cache memory C1      checks the value of the LRU data to which the cache line sent from the      cache memory C0 is to be assigned. The cache memory C1 drives out a cache      line having the ""oldest"" value of the LRU data and registers the sent      cache line. The cache memory C1 sets the value of the LRU data of the      registered cache line to the ""latest"". Furthermore, the cache memory C1      returns the data of the address X to the processor P1.  [0033] Moreover, since the replacement condition of the cache memory C1 of      the replacement setting register RREG is currently set to ""move"", the      access control unit ACNT moves a cache line overflowed from the cache      memory C1 to the cache memory C0. The cache memory C0 registers a cache      line overflowed from the cache memory C1 to a location where the cache      line (cache line at which the cache hit was generated) that has been sent      to the cache memory C1 was present. The cache memory C0 sets the value of      the LRU data of the registered cache line to the ""oldest"". Since a cache      line at which the cache hit was generated in the cache memory C0 of a      lower hierarchy is moved to the cache memory C1 in this manner, the same      data will not be present in the cache memory C0 and in the cache memory      C1. For this reason, the efficiency of cache memory utilization can be      improved. Moreover, a cache line overflowed from the cache memory C1 of a      higher hierarchy is moved to the cache memory C0 of a lower hierarchy      without being returned to the main memory MM. Accordingly, when a certain      processor issues an access request to an address corresponding to this      cache line, the cache line is still registered with the cache memory C0,      and therefore the latency can be reduced.  [0034] In operation S130, the processor P2 issues a write request for the      address X to the cache memory C2 (level 1). The cache memory C2 results      in a cache miss. The cache memory C2 notifies the access control unit      ACNT of the cache miss. The access control unit ACNT issues a write      request for the address X to the cache memories C0, C1 (level 2). The      cache memory C1 results in a cache hit. The cache memory C1 notifies the      access control unit ACNT of the cache hit. The access control unit ACNT      checks the value of the LRU data of a cache line at which the cache hit      was generated, and the transfer condition of the transfer setting      register TREG. Since the value of the LRU data indicates the ""latest"",      the access control unit ACNT keeps the cache line at which the cache hit      was generated without moving it. The access control unit ACNT sends to      the cache memory C1 the data sent from the processor P2. The cache memory      C1 writes to the cache line at which the cache hit was generated the data      sent from the processor P2 via the access control unit ACNT, and sets the      value of the LRU data to the ""second"". The cache memory C1 sets the      updated cache line to ""dirty"". Alternatively, the cache memory C1 writes      through to the cache memory C3 of a lower hierarchy or through to the      main memory MM without setting the updated cache line to ""dirty"". Here,      the write-through is a method in which when a processor writes data to a      cache memory of a higher hierarchy, the data is written to a cache memory      of a higher hierarchy and at the same time also to a memory of a lower      hierarchy.  [0035] In operation S130, the processor P2 writes data directly to the      cache memory C1. For this reason, when the processor P1 issues an access      request for the address X before operation S140, the data of the address      X is still registered with the cache memory C1 (level 1), and therefore      the latency can be reduced.  [0036] In operation S140, the processor P2 issues again a write request for      the address X to the cache memory C2 (level 1). The cache memory C2      results in a cache miss. The cache memory C2 notifies the access control      unit ACNT of the cache miss. The access control unit ACNT issues a write      request for the address X to the cache memories C0, C1 (level 2). The      cache memory C1 results in a cache hit. The cache memory C1 notifies the      access control unit ACNT of the cache hit. The access control unit ACNT      checks the value of the LRU data of a cache line at which the cache hit      was generated, and the transfer condition of the transfer setting      register TREG. Since the value of the LRU data indicates the ""second"",      the access control unit ACNT moves a cache line at which the cache hit      was generated to the cache memory C2 of the uppermost hierarchy. The      cache memory C2 checks the value of the LRU data to which the cache line      sent from the cache memory C1 is to be assigned. The cache memory C2      drives out a cache line having the ""oldest"" value of the LRU data and      registers the sent cache line. The cache memory C2 writes to the      registered cache line the data sent from the processor P2. The cache      memory C2 sets the written cache line to ""dirty"" and sets the value of      the LRU data to the ""latest"". Accordingly, when the processor P2 issues      again an access request for the address X, the data of the address X is      still registered with the cache memory C2 (level 1), and therefore the      latency can be reduced.  [0037] Since the replacement condition of the cache memory C2 of the      replacement setting register RREG is currently set to ""move"", the access      control unit ACNT moves a cache line overflowed from the cache memory C2      to the cache memory C1. The cache memory C1 registers the cache line      overflowed from the cache memory C2 to a location where the cache line      sent to the cache memory C2 was present, and changes the value of the LRU      data to the ""oldest"". Also in this case, as in operation S120, a cache      line overflowed from the cache memory C2 of a higher hierarchy is moved      to the cache memory C1 of a lower hierarchy without being returned to the      main memory MM. Accordingly, when a certain processor issues an access      request to an address corresponding to this cache line, the cache line is      still registered with the cache memory C1, and therefore the latency can      be reduced.  [0038] In operation S150, the processor P1 issues a read request for the      address Y to the cache memory C1 (level 1). The cache memory C1 results      in a cache miss. The cache memory C1 notifies the access control unit      ACNT of the cache miss. The access control unit ACNT issues a read      request for the address Y to the cache memories C0, C2 (level 2). The      cache memories C0, C2 result in a cache miss. The cache memories C0, C2      notify the access control unit ACNT of the cache miss. The access control      unit ACNT issues a read request for the address Y to the cache memory C3      (level 3). The cache memory C3 results in a cache hit. The cache memory      C3 notifies the access control unit ACNT of the cache hit. Since the      transfer condition of the cache memory C3 of the transfer setting      register TREG is currently set to ""copy"", the access control unit ACNT      copies a cache line at which the cache hit was generated to the cache      memory C1 of the uppermost hierarchy. The cache memory C1 checks the      value of the LRU data to which a cache line sent from the cache memory C3      is to be assigned. The cache memory C1 drives out a cache line having the      ""oldest"" value of the LRU data and registers the sent cache line. The      cache memory C1 sets the value of the LRU data to the ""latest"".      Furthermore, the cache memory C1 returns the data of the address Y to the      processor P1. Moreover, since the replacement condition of the cache      memory C1 of the replacement setting register RREG is currently set to      ""move"", the access control unit ACNT moves a cache line overflowed from      the cache memory C1 to the cache memory C0 of one level lower. As shown      in FIG. 2, when there is a plurality of cache memories of one level      lower, a cache memory to serve as the destination of the cache line is      selected based on a certain criterion. In operation S150, the cache      memory to serve as the destination of the cache line is randomly selected      from the cache memory C0 and the cache memory C2. As a result, the cache      memory C0 is selected.  [0039] The cache memory C0 checks the value of the LRU data to which the      cache line sent from the cache memory C1 is to be assigned. The cache      memory C0 drives out a cache line having the ""oldest"" value of the LRU      data and registers the sent cache line. The cache memory C0 sets the      value of the LRU data to the ""oldest"". Since the replacement condition of      the cache memory C0 of the replacement setting register RREG is currently      set to ""discard"", the access control unit ACNT discards the cache line      overflowed from the cache memory C0. When the replacement condition is      set to ""discard"", a move of the cache line to the lower hierarchy cache      memory will not occur, and therefore the bus occupancy ratio can be      reduced. However, when the cache line to be discarded is ""dirty"", the      access control unit ACNT moves the cache line to be discarded to the      cache memory C3. The cache memory C3 checks the value of the LRU data to      which a cache line sent from the cache memory C0 is to be assigned. The      cache memory C3 drives out a cache line having the ""oldest"" value of the      LRU data and registers the sent cache line. The cache memory C3 sets the      registered cache line to ""dirty"". Since the replacement condition of the      cache memory C3 of the replacement setting register RREG is currently set      to ""discard"", the access control unit ACNT discards the cache line      overflowed from the cache memory C3. At this time, when the cache line to      be discarded is ""dirty"", the access control unit ACNT writes the cache      line to be discarded to the main memory MM.  [0040] As described above, in this embodiment, since the processors P0-P2      can access all the cache memories C0-C3 in accordance with the      hierarchical levels set in the hierarchy setting register LREG, the      efficiency of cache memory utilization can be improved. Furthermore,      since the condition set in the registers LREG, TREG, and RREG can be set      to an appropriate condition for each application, it is always possible      to reduce the latency without depending on the application. As a result,      the latency can be reduced while maintaining a high efficiency of cache      memory utilization.  [0041] FIG. 7 shows another embodiment. The same element as the element      described in FIG. 1 to FIG. 6 is given the same symbol, and the detailed      description thereof is omitted. In the multiprocessor system of this      embodiment, the cache memory C3 of the embodiment described in FIG. 1 to      FIG. 6 is omitted, and a processor P3 and a hierarchy setting unit LCNT      are added. Moreover, the cache memory C1 is divided into a cache memory      C1A and a cache memory C1B, assuming that the cache memory capacity may      be small judging from the characteristics of the application of the      processor P1. The cache memory C1B is opened to other processors.  [0042] The processor P3 is directly coupled to the access control unit      ACNT. The hierarchy setting unit LCNT is coupled to the access control      unit ACNT and the hierarchy setting register LREG. The hierarchy setting      unit LCNT sets hierarchical levels to the hierarchy setting register      LREG. In this embodiment, for an access request of the processor P0, the      hierarchy setting unit LCNT sets hierarchical levels of FIG. 9 to the      hierarchy setting register LREG when a cache hit is generated in the      cache memory C2, and the hierarchy setting unit LCNT sets hierarchical      levels of FIG. 8 to the hierarchy setting register LREG when a cache hit      is generated in the cache memory C1B.  [0043] FIG. 8 shows an example of the hierarchical levels of each of the      cache memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the processors      P0-P3. In this example, the hierarchical levels of the cache memories C0,      C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the processor P0 are level 1, unused,      level 2, and level 3, respectively. The hierarchical levels of the cache      memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the processor P1 are      unused, level 1, unused, unused, respectively. The hierarchical levels of      the cache memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the processor P2      are unused, unused, unused, level 1, respectively.  [0044] The hierarchical levels of the cache memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2      when viewed from the processor P3 are unused, unused, unused, level 1,      respectively. In the unused cache memory, a flag indicative of ""unused""      is set in the hierarchy setting register LREG.  [0045] FIG. 9 shows another example of the hierarchical levels of each of      the cache memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the processors      P0-P3. In this example, the hierarchical levels of the cache memories C0,      C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the processor P0 are level 1, unused,      level 3, and level 2, respectively. The hierarchical levels of the cache      memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the processor P1 are      unused, level 1, unused, unused, respectively. The hierarchical levels of      the cache memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the processor P2      are unused, unused, unused, level 1, respectively. The hierarchical      levels of the cache memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 when viewed from the      processor P3 are unused, unused, level 1, unused, respectively. However,      when a cache miss was generated in the cache memory C1B, the processor P3      accesses the main memory MM without registering the cache line with the      cache memory C1B. That is, only when a cache hit was generated in the      cache memory C1B, the processor P3 uses the cache memory C1B.  [0046] FIG. 10 shows the transfer condition of a cache line at which the      cache hit was generated in the cache memory of a lower hierarchy. The      transfer condition shown in FIG. 10 is set in the transfer setting      register TREG shown in FIG. 7. Since the cache memories C0, C1A will not      be of a lower hierarchy, the transfer condition is not set. The cache      memory C1B moves a cache line at which the cache hit was generated. The      cache memory C2 copies a cache line at which the cache hit was generated.  [0047] FIG. 11 shows the replacement condition of a cache line overflowed      from a cache memory of a higher hierarchy when the cache line is      registered. The condition shown in FIG. 11 is set in the replacement      setting register RREG shown in FIG. 7. The replacement conditions of the      cache memories C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 are ""move"", ""discard"", ""write to main      memory MM"", and ""discard"", respectively. Here, ""write to main memory MM""      implies writing data back to the main memory MM.  [0048] FIG. 12 shows an example of the operation of the multiprocessor      system of FIG. 7. In this example, the data of the address X and the data      of the address Y are not registered yet with the cache memories C0, C1A,      C1B, and C2. Moreover, for the hierarchical levels of the cache memories      C0, C1A, C1B, and C2 before operation S200, the hierarchical levels shown      in FIG. 8 are set in the hierarchy setting register LREG shown in FIG. 7.      As a method of driving out the existing data in order to secure a place      for new data to be stored, the value of the LRU data used in a      conventional cache memory system is used, though not shown in FIG. 7. The      operation is described with such case as an example.  [0049] First, in operation S200, the processor P2 issues a write request      for the address X to the cache memory C2 (level 1). The cache memory C2      results in a cache miss. The cache memory C2 notifies the access control      unit ACNT of the cache miss. Since a cache memory having a lower      hierarchy than the cache memory C2 is currently not set in the hierarchy      setting register LREG, the access control unit ACNT issues a read request      for a cache line including the address X to the main memory MM. The cache      memory C2 registers a cache line read from the main memory MM, via the      access control unit ACNT. The cache memory C2 writes to the registered      cache line the data sent from the processor P2. Then, the cache memory C2      sets the written cache line to ""dirty"".  [0050] In operation S210, the processor P0 issues a read request for the      address X to the cache memory C0 (level 1). The cache memory C0 results      in a cache miss. The cache memory C0 notifies the access control unit      ACNT of the cache miss. The access control unit ACNT issues a read      request for the address X to the cache memory C1B (level 2). The cache      memory C1B results in a cache miss. The cache memory C1B notifies the      access control unit ACNT of the cache miss. The access control unit ACNT      issues a read request for the address X to the cache memory C2 (level 3).      The cache memory C2 results in a cache hit. The cache memory C2 notifies      the access control unit ACNT of the cache hit. Since the transfer      condition of the cache memory C2 of the transfer setting register TREG is      currently set to ""copy"", the access control unit ACNT copies a cache line      at which a cache hit was generated to the cache memory C0 of the      uppermost hierarchy. The cache memory C0 checks the value of the LRU data      to which a cache line sent from the cache memory C2 is to be assigned.      The cache memory C0 drives out a cache line having the ""oldest"" value of      the LRU data and registers the sent cache line. The cache memory C0 sets      the value of the LRU data to the ""latest"". Then, the cache memory C0      returns the data of the address X to the processor P0. Since the      replacement condition of the cache memory C0 of the replacement setting      register RREG is currently set to ""move"", the access control unit ACNT      moves a cache line (value of the LRU data is the ""oldest"") overflowed      from the cache memory C0 to the cache memory C1B of one level lower. The      cache memory C1B checks the value of the LRU data to which a cache line      sent from the cache memory C0 is to be assigned. The cache memory C1B      drives out a cache line having the ""oldest"" value of the LRU data and      registers the sent cache line. Since the replacement condition of the      cache memory C1B of the replacement setting register RREG is currently      set to ""write to main memory MM"", the access control unit ACNT writes the      data of the cache line to the main memory MM after confirming that the      cache line overflowed from the cache memory C1B is ""dirty"". If it is not      ""dirty"", the access control unit ACNT discards this without writing to      the main memory MM. Moreover, the access control unit ACNT notifies the      hierarchy setting unit LCNT of the fact that a cache hit was generated in      the cache memory C2. The hierarchy setting unit LCNT changes the setting      of the hierarchy setting register LREG from the hierarchical level of      FIG. 8 to the hierarchical level of FIG. 9. Through this operation, for      example, a certain application, once starting to use the data present in      the cache memory C1B (or cache memory C2), will continue to access the      data present in the cache memory C1B (or cache memory C2). In this case,      if this application is operated by the processor P0, the hierarchy      setting unit LCNT will change the hierarchical levels of the cache      memories C1B, C2 in response to a cache hit in a lower hierarchy, and      therefore the latency can be reduced.  [0051] In operation S220, the processor P3 issues a read request for the      address Y to the cache memory C1B (level 1). The cache memory C1B results      in a cache miss. The cache memory C1B notifies the access control unit      ACNT of the cache miss. Since a cache memory having a lower hierarchy      than the cache memory C1B is currently not set in the hierarchy setting      register LREG, the access control unit ACNT issues a read request for the      address Y to the main memory MM. The access control unit ACNT returns to      the processor P3 the data read from the main memory MM without      registering this read data with the cache memory C1B. For this reason,      the data being present in the cache memory C1B and being required in the      processor P0 is not driven out by the access of the processor P3. As a      result, if the processor P0 accesses again the data currently registered      with the cache memory C1B, the number of occurrence of cache miss in the      cache memory C1B will decrease, and therefore the latency can be reduced.      Moreover, when the processor P3 uses the data currently registered with      the cache memory C1B, the processor P3 can access the cache memory C1B,      and therefore the latency can be reduced further than in accessing the      main memory MM.  [0052] As described above, also in this embodiment, the same effects as      those of the embodiment described in FIG. 1 to FIG. 6 can be obtained.      Furthermore, in this embodiment, the hierarchy setting unit LCNT changes      the hierarchical levels of the cache memories C1B, C2 in response to a      cache hit in a lower hierarchy, so that the latency can be reduced in      continuously accessing the same cache memory.  [0053] Note that, in the embodiment described in FIG. 1 to FIG. 6, in      operation S110 of FIG. 6, an example has been described in which the      processor P1 having made an access request accesses the data while      keeping the cache line at which a cache hit was generated in the cache      memory C0 of a lower hierarchy. However, for example, the access control      unit ACNT may cause the processor P1 to access the data present in the      cache memory C0 without going through the cache memory C1. This      eliminates the data delay time of the amount of going through the cache      memory C1, so that the latency can be reduced.  [0054] In the embodiment described in FIG. 1 to FIG. 6, an example has been      described in which the value of the LRU data is used as the transfer      condition of a cache line at which a cache hit was generated. However,      the hardware configuration can be simplified, for example, by employing a      method of determining the transfer condition without using the value of      the LRU data. Also in this case, such transfer condition that the latency      becomes optimal for each application can be set, so that the latency can      be reduced. Moreover, a method may be employed wherein the transfer      condition is determined using another access information, in place of the      LRU data, as the access information which is a record of being accessed      from the processor to a cache line. For example, the number of accesses      of a cache line at which a cache hit was generated is recorded in each of      the tags TG0-TG3 of each of the cache memories C0-C3, and the number of      accesses recorded in each of the tags TG0-TG3 is used as the transfer      condition. That is, the access control unit ACNT operates in accordance      with the information stored in the tags TGO-TG3 in addition to the      conditions set in the transfer setting register TREG. Also in this case,      such transfer condition that the latency becomes optimal for each      application can be set, so that the latency can be reduced.  [0055] In the embodiment described in FIG. 1 to FIG. 6, an example of      controlling a cache line overflowed from a cache memory of a higher      hierarchy has been described. However, the number of registers can be      reduced, for example, by employing a method of setting the control of a      cache line overflowed from a higher hierarchy only to ""move"" and moving      the cache line to other cache memories without using the replacement      setting register RREG. Also in this case, the access control unit ACNT      moves a cache line overflowed from a higher hierarchy to other cache      memories, so that the chances to access the main memory MM can be reduced      and the latency can be reduced.  [0056] A proposition of the embodiments is to reduce the latency while      maintaining a high efficiency of cache memory utilization.  [0057] In the embodiments described above, the multiprocessor system      includes a cache memory corresponding to each processor, a hierarchy      setting register in which the hierarchical level of each cache memory is      set, and an access control unit that controls access between each cache      memory.  [0058] Each processor handles a cache memory corresponding to another      processor as the cache memory having a deeper hierarchy than a cache      memory corresponding to the each processor. As the result, each processor      can access all the cache memories, so that the efficiency of cache memory      utilization can be improved. Since the hierarchical level of a cache      memory for each processor is stored in a rewritable hierarchy setting      register, it can be changed so that the latency may be optimal for each      application.  [0059] Moreover, the condition (hereinafter, referred to also as the      transfer condition) for determining whether to move, copy, or keep a      cache line when a cache hit was generated in the cache memory of a lower      hierarchy is set in a rewritable transfer setting register. This allows      for setting of such transfer condition that the latency becomes optimal      for each application. For example, a certain application continues to use      a cache line currently registered with the cache memory of a lower      hierarchy. In this case, the latency can be reduced by setting the      transfer condition of the cache line to ""move"" or ""copy"". In another      example, a specific processor more frequently accesses the data shared by      each of the processors than the other processors. In this case, the      latency can be reduced by setting the transfer condition of a cache      memory corresponding to the specific processor to ""keep"".  [0060] As the result, the latency can be reduced while maintaining a high      efficiency of cache memory utilization.  [0061] The many features and advantages of the embodiments are apparent      from the detailed specification and, thus, it is intended by the appended      claims to cover all such features and advantages of the embodiments that      fall within the true spirit and scope thereof.

With the  RSA security conference  kicking off this week, I wanted to start sharing more information about the security features and benefits of Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1. Over the next several weeks, well blog in greater detail about some of the security improvements in Beta 1, such as the new Safety Filter, greater control over ActiveX controls, and new AJAX features for safer mashups (XDomainRequest and XDM). This is not a complete list of our security investments for the release; we will have more to talk about during future milestones.   Internet Explorer 8 security features target three major sources of security exploits: social engineering, Web server, and browser-based vulnerabilities. This post will cover IE8 Data Execution Prevention (DEP), a feature that mitigates browser-based vulnerabilities.   DEP/NX Memory Protection in Internet Explorer 8  Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista introduced an off-by-default Internet Control Panel option to Enable memory protection to help mitigate online attacks.  This option is also referred to as Data Execution Prevention ( DEP ) or No-Execute (NX).     We have enabled this option by default for Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista SP1 and later.   DEP/NX helps to foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable.  DEP/NX, combined with other technologies like Address Space Layout Randomization ( ASLR ), make it harder for attackers to exploit certain types of memory-related vulnerabilities like buffer overruns. Best of all, the protection applies to both Internet Explorer  and  the add-ons it loads. No additional user interaction is required to provide this protection, and no new prompts are introduced.    DEP/NX Compatibility  For Internet Explorer 7, DEP/NX was disabled by default for  compatibility reasons .  Several popular add-ons were not compatible with DEP/NX and would crash when Internet Explorer loaded them with DEP/NX enabled.  The most common problem was that these add-ons were built using an older version of the  ATL library .  Before version 7.1 SP1, ATL relied upon dynamically generated code in a way not compatible with DEP/NX.  While developers of many popular add-ons have since released updated extensions compatible with DEP/NX, some add-ons may not be updated before Internet Explorer 8 becomes available.    Fortunately,  new DEP/NX APIs  have been added to Windows Server 2008 and recent Windows Service Packs to enable use of DEP/NX while retaining compatibility with older ATL versions.  These new APIs allow Internet Explorer to opt-in to DEP/NX without causing add-ons built with older versions of ATL to crash.     In rare cases where an add-on is not DEP/NX compatible for reasons other than outdated ATL usage, a group policy option will be available to allow an organization to opt-out of DEP/NX for Internet Explorer until an updated version of the broken add-on can be deployed.  Local Administrators can control DEP/NX by running Internet Explorer as an Administrator and unchecking the Tools > Internet Options > Advanced > Enable memory protection to help mitigate online attacks option.   Checking Your Protection  You can see which processes are protected by DEP/NX on Windows Vista Task Managers Process tab; on earlier versions of Windows, you can use  Process Explorer .  In either case, ensure that the Data Execution Prevention box is checked in the View > Select Columns menu.   Developer Call to Action  If you build Internet Explorer add-ons, you can help ensure users enjoy a smooth upgrade to IE8 by taking the following steps today:     If your code depends on older versions of ATL, please rebuild it with ATL v7.1 SP1 or later (Visual Studio 2005 includes ATL 8.0)    Set the  /NXCompat  linker option to indicate that your extension is compatible with DEP/NX    Test your code with DEP/NX enabled using IE8 Beta 1 on Windows Vista SP1. (Alternatively, test with IE7 on Windows Vista after enabling the DEP/NX option. To enable DEP/NX for IE7: Run IE as an administrator, then set the appropriate checkbox in the Tools > Internet Options > Advanced tab)    Opt your code into  other available defenses  like stack defense (/GS), safe exception handling (/SafeSEH), and ASLR (/DynamicBase)    Thanks for your help in securing the web!

Although, I can check this option in 32-bit edition of IE8... Does it mean Internet Explorer 64-bit use DEP by default (well, iexplore.exe is ""protected"" on Task Manager's Process tab)?   Regards,   MusK                   #         re: IE8 Security Part I: DEP/NX Memory Protection     Tuesday, April 08, 2008 4:07 PM by  EricLaw [MSFT]                       @MusK: Great question!  In Windows, all 64-bit processes have DEP enabled automatically.  There is no mechanism to disable DEP for a 64-bit process.                   #         re: IE8 Security Part I: DEP/NX Memory Protection     Tuesday, April 08, 2008 4:16 PM by  Markus                       eric: Great post Eric, no beefs at all.   IE Team: What is the strategy for opacity support in IE8?   At the moment, it looks like CSS3 opacity:     opacity: 0.5;   is off the table (ok, fine), but there is no   -msie-opacity support either (e.g. before the spec is final)     -mise-opacity: 0.5;   and worse yet, it appears to me (from my testing), that the IE proprietary filter based opacity doesn't work either.     filter: alpha(opacity=50);   Which in itself sucks, but worse yet, it applies an opacity=0%!!!!!! if you try to set it (e.g. 100% transparent!)   I certainly hope this is fixed in IE8 soon, but if it won't support the legacy stuff, can we please have the filter:alpha fallback to 100% opacity, so that our interfaces at least appear on screen.   By the way, I don't see much ranting about this on the blog?  Am I truly the only one to have seen this? or was this found very early on?                   #         Internet Explorer 8.0 and Data Execution Prevention (DEP/NX)     Tuesday, April 08, 2008 4:28 PM by  Michael Howard's Web Log                       Eric Lawrence just posted some commentary about IE8 and DEP/NX.

Note: In prior years, some major OEMs shipped computers with DEP-capable processors, but (for reasons I don't understand) disabled the DEP feature in the system BIOS.  In such cases, users typically can re-enable hardware support for DEP by using the BIOS setup screen.                   #         re: IE8 Security Part I: DEP/NX Memory Protection     Wednesday, April 09, 2008 9:46 PM by  mocax                       In Vista, ALT+Enter in search box doesn't open up in a new tab, is it security related?

clueweb09-en0000-04-17593	             Intrepid Blog     A few thoughts                            Posts Tagged ‘managed memory’                                      The GC: As A Managed Memory Allocator       Sunday, September 11th, 2005               Most Garbage Collectors aren’t limited to just tracing the garbage (unused objects) and scheduling it for deletion, but also manage memory as a whole including allocating it.   Data segment   The kernel of an Operating System takes care of mapping physical memory (RAM/Swap memory/IO memory/Cache’s) to virtual memory available to a process. A process is allocated a few segment’s of memory. The one that is important to memory allocators is the  Data Segment .   The  Data Segment  is  the  segment which contains memory which is used for random access by the program. The size of the  Data Segment  can be changed using the  sbrk  or  brk  C function, which asks the kernel for more memory to be mapped for the process, which then returns a pointer to the start of the newly allocated space. (providing a negative value will result in decreasing the data segment size).   Malloc   A  non-Gc  memory manager/allocator are  malloc  and its friends. Malloc uses  sbrk  to obtain memory for the  Data Segment  to allocate memory from as almost all other allocators. It prefixes and suffixes all blocks of free or allocated memory by size fields so it can walk through the whole heap. It puts in each freeblock a pointer to the next and previous freeblock, which makes freeblocks easy to insert and find.    Freeing a block is simply adding into the freeblock chain and setting a bit to flag it is a free block. Allocating a block is simply walking the freeblock chain until a freeblock is found that can hold the required size, and adds new size’s and flags to the new freeblock and updates the pointers one block previous and next into the freeblock chain to match the new offset of the freeblock.   The big problem with  malloc  is fragmentation.  sbrk  could be required to be called to enlarge the heap size to create a freeblock big enough for the allocation although there is enough freespace for that allocation, which is scattered and not contiguous.   Modern implementations of  malloc  feature tricks to prefer perfect fits and automaticly coalesce freeblocks to create bigger blocks, which all makes  malloc  a whole lot slower than it should be with still quite a lot of memory fragmentation.   Gc managed pointers and  malloc   Most Gc’s implement their own memory allocator routines instead of using  malloc , usually even overriding the old malloc. This is because Gc’s usually know more about the requirements of the application than  malloc  itself.   It gets even better when the Gc knows all pointers to the managed heap. In this case a Gc could decide to move an object, update the pointers that linked to it, and save a lot of space from fragmentation. This is easily implemented when dealing with a interpreted language which uses a Gc for it knows all types runtime. It even can be done in C, but that requires all pointers both inside as outside the managed heap that point into the managed heap to be registered.   The difficult part is to find all pointers pointing to a certain object. This usually requires the whole heap to be walked, once or twice. Waiting until a reasonable amount of objects would be subject to move, and then doing one big move of all those objects, and possibly other operations requiring heap walks while doing it anyway as one big “garbage collection” would be way more efficient than doing this all ‘live’. In the first pass each object subject to move could be tagged with the new location and on the second pass all pointers would be checked and adjusted accordingly.   Unmanaged code interop   The big problem of being able to move managed memory is keeping track of all pointers into the managed memory. If you would want to store a file handle in managed memory you would have a hard time when the internals of file access keep contain pointers to your file handle.   Fixed allocations, which remain stationary would solve the issue  but this could, sadly enough, result in fragmentation of your heap. When all objects can be moved it is very easy to move, but when there are fixed objects somewhere in the heap, complicated ‘fitting’ algorithms must be used which decrease performance.   Fixing memory temporarily, or preventing a GC temporarily is a much cleaner solution to the problem. In some cases this just isn’t possible and big blocks with their own  malloc  style allocator could be used to handle unmanaged memory so that it won’t interfere too much with the normal managed memeory. On most *nix systems  mmap  could be used to map additional usable memory to the virtual memory space of the process. Which is slower than bsrk and create some extra overhead, but it will avoid fragmentation in managed heap due to fixed blocks.   When   It is only usefull for a Gc to implement its own malloc when it can move its objects, or when there is a clear advantage to implementing the  malloc  close to the Gc, which could be for instance to more easily walk through all objects in the heap without having to implement a walk algorithm for each malloc used accross different platforms.

The plan was to do it in less than one week, it took a bit more since I had to work on other things, fix some bugs with the EFL itself and also implement new features (like  pointer_mode: NOGRAB ) and also did the initial graphics, later replaced with Ian’s nice work.  It does no type prediction, word hint, cursor navigation or key composition (accents are not possible).   Summary is 230 lines of Python, 1110 lines of Edje, including comments and  blank lines, and a really easy to type keyboard.     Keyboard code: SVN  http://barbieri-playground.googlecode.com/svn/efl-tests/vkbd/     EDIT:  I removed n800 easy install and packages, this was meant to be a simple EFL demo, but now we have better demos and applications using EFL, like Canola and Carman.                                                   49 Responses to “iPhone-like virtual keyboard for n800”                       on 24 Jul 2007 at 10:19 pm    1. disq  said …                 Nokia-N800-26:/usr/share/python-efl-core-demo/examples# ./02-vkbd.py   *** ECORE ERROR: Ecore Magic Check Failed!!!  *** IN FUNCTION: ecore_evas_data_set()    Input handle pointer is NULL!  *** NAUGHTY PROGRAMMER!!!  *** SPANK SPANK SPANK!!!  *** Now go fix your code.

It’s available on this site, just search for “Edje demo”                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 12:34 am    4. linuxrebel  said …                 Gustavo.  I can’t wait till you get to the point of being able to integrate all of this into a ‘desktop’ for the n800 they keyboard really is nice, the demo’s are nice… I’m just a bit anxious *grin*  Thanks!                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 12:52 am    5. Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri  said …                 @linuxrebel: I’m just showcasing EFL, that it’s possible to create these nice effects with good performance and minimum amount of code. It’s up to other developers to create applications using it, building the “desktop” you ask      Ok, this showcase also have as focus on INdT products, like Canola, the software I work. It will use EFL in near future, so I need to evaluate performance, fix bugs and implement required features.   This technology is totally Open Source (BSD license), developed upstream at  http://www.enlightenment.org/  Most libraries were already existent (evas, ecore, edje), just optimizations for n800 were required, but some were written at INdT, like python bindings (python-efl).                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 7:41 am    6. disq  said …                 uh, I had efl-core 0.9.9.039_indt2. updated it to 0.9.9.040_indt1.   “dpkg -l *efl*” now gives me:  ii  efl-core             0.9.9.040_indt1      Enlightenment Foundation Libraries Core  ii  python-efl-core      0.1_indt1            Enlightenment Foundation Libraries Core - Python Binding  ii  python-efl-core-demo 0.1.1_indt1          Enlightenment Foundation Libraries Core - Python Bi   still won’t work, same error message.   n800 latest firmware.

Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri  said …                 @disq: problem is python-efl-core == 0.1_indt1, it should be 0.1.1_indt1, please update manually. I have forgot to increase dependency number of these packages and haven’t noticed it, since I always remove and then install again. My bad!                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 8:57 am    8. Tomas  said …                 Very nice work. Perhaps we need to look at Python bindings for the Hildon input method plugins, so that it would be possible to plug this thing into it                             on 25 Jul 2007 at 9:05 am    9. Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri  said …                 @tomas: it would be great to see someone making it available for broader use than a simple demo      But remember that some minor things needs to be done, like add a word list for type prediction and correction, composite keys, etc. It shouldn’t be hard, but I’ll postpone it until some of our products need it (Canola, Carman, …).   BTW, although hildon-input-method is cool and make it available everywhere, I’d make vkbd available inside applications itself, with the requirement apps would need to be EFL based. This way we could have this keyboard to fade in and make it more interactive with the whole environment.                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 10:27 am    10. nhoglund  said …                 This looks cool.   Where can I get the required libraries libgdbm3, libreadline4 and libxdamage1?   I’m running on the latest release of the N800 firmware.                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 10:30 am    11. disq  said …                 works now, good job                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 10:42 am    12.

Will this work with nokia 770. If yes how to do it ?                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 11:06 am    14. Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri  said …                 @jayakumark: No, these binaries are compiled for ARM6 (arm1136jf-s), so just work on N800.   However you can compile EFL yourself and then it will work. This is not a difficult task, but really cumbersome. I plan to release 770 packages at some point, but not sure how soon it will happen.   I have  https://garage.maemo.org/projects/maemo-efl  for people interested in EFL, any volunteers to help me with packaging? Right now I’m alone on the packaging and doing the packages manually (no dpkg-buildpackage or like).                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 11:23 am    15. nhoglund  said …                 Is it possible to make a .install file add more than one feed?  If so, it would be a good idea to make your .install file add that one, so that it really becomes a one click install, and to prevent problems like mine.                          on 25 Jul 2007 at 11:42 am    16. Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri  said …                 @nhoglund: I don’t think so, sorry                             on 25 Jul 2007 at 12:08 pm    17. Niklas Hglund  said …                 That’s a shame. I’ve had similar problems in the past with packages requiring for example libglade. This takes the nice easy .install files back to manual descriptions of what feeds to add, etc.   I really like being to install programs so easily, and to have the ability to upgrade them in a single place.   Thanks anyway. I’ll try the EFL stuff as soon as I get home from work.                          on 27 Jul 2007 at 5:02 am    18.

I suspect it might be the PNG lib I am using, libpng12-dev 1.2.15~beta5-lubuntul ??   Any pointers would be appreciated ….                          on 21 Aug 2007 at 11:25 pm    24. Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri  said …                 It should build fine with this version, I’m using 1.2.18-r1 (gentoo) myself, but it also works on scratchbox/maemo (1.2.8rel-1osso3)…   What should be happening is different versions of this library around, please check with “ldd /usr/local/lib/evas/modules/loaders/png/linux-gnu-i686/module.so”,  it should report the missing libraries.   But I recommend use of Ubuntu repository, as explained at:   http://wiki.enlightenment.org/index.php/E17_User_Guide/Installing_using_Linux_distribution_packages#Ubuntu_Linux   You can also join IRC, #edevelop at irc.freenode.net                          on 26 Aug 2007 at 6:47 pm    25. atdrez  said …                 Nice work!   I have a question. I’ve tried to run the sample files without success. Looking at the code, it seems that there are some missing “.edj” files. I’m using Ubuntu, I’ve got the latest version (all e17 module) from the CVS.   There is some other place I could get these files?

I’ve changed to:   self.on_edje_signal_mouse_down_key(self, emission, source)   and stopped the warning ‘Type Error’ when pressed the button multiple times.   But, great work, this could be used someday to substitute the default Maemo keyboard.                          on 26 Aug 2007 at 9:23 pm    28. Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri  said …                 Sorry!

I usually use the stylis & software keyboard.  It takes too much energy, jumping around with a toothpick.  And, my bluetooth keyboard has that annoying slight lag too it.  This is exactly what the N800 needs!                          on 10 Sep 2007 at 12:01 am    30. applesbananas  said …                 I can’t get the app to install on my n800 via the .install or .deb package.

Only request is if you could port this to the 770.  I have only seen the demo you posted on the 800 and this is something that would really be great on the 770 as well!!  Currently I have the 770 with os 2007 hacker edition and I love the device… this would be another great edition to my little tablet!   I would help you myself with the packaging but I am a total newbie with very little programming experience.                          on 26 Sep 2007 at 9:50 pm    33. Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri  said …                 @sm: now that Ed Bartosh provided proper debian packages at  https://garage.maemo.org/projects/maemo-efl  you can just download current SVN and change “debian/rules”, removing ARMv6 specific bits from CFLAGS.   Or just wait a bit, Ed will provide 770 packages sooner or later.                          on 07 Oct 2007 at 9:56 am    34.

Photoshop-less or Illustrator-less people now have an alternative with the latest build of Inkscape, thanks to Silveira Neto and friends .   Inkscape is actually a fantastic program (I’ve used it for years), its native format is SVG, but it supports many other popular formats.   Inkscape  is a Vector Graphics Editor, similar to Adobe Illustrator, that strives to be SVG Compliant, open source, responsive and extensible.   On a recent post, Inkscape and JavaFX working together , Silveira explains a little about the new JavaFX export feature for Inkscape.     You can get a pre-compiled, ready-to-use version of inkscape with JavaFX export support  from here.  I’ve download and test ‘ Inkscape20225-0811201443.7z ‘ dated (20-Nov-2008 14:4) and it works just fine. However, this is a test build version, so there may be bugs. You can actually download and use more than one version of Inkscape, so it may be worth while using the stable release for actual graphic work, and just use the above build to do the export to JavaFX.

The latter two are not available in the free version of Voyager.        com.objectspace.voyager.Namespace         Static Methods      bind(java.lang.String name, java.lang.Object object)  lookup(java.lang.String name)  rebind(java.lang.String name, java.lang.Object object)  setServerURL(java.lang.Object obj)       Used only in lightweight clients (applets) to be able to use the applet server machine as a proxy for a naming service on a different machine.     unbind(java.lang.String name)        RMI & Voyager   Voyager programs can be uses as RMI clients and RMI servers      As RMI Client    The following voyager code will access an RMI server registered with a RMI register running on port 5645 on eli.sdsu.edu     Ifoo aFooStub =     (Ifoo) Namespace.lookup( ""rmi://eli.sdsu.edu:5645/myFoo"" );        As RMI Server      The following code will register a voyager server with rmiregistry running on eli on port 5645. The aBarObject’s class can not extend UnicasteRemote. See Voyager manual page 126 for details on classpath. See page 263 for an example.     Namespace.bind( ""rmi://eli.sdsu.edu:5645/myBar"", aBarObject );  Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 6      Modile Code    The of() method in com.objectspace.voyager.mobility.Mobility returns the IMobility facet of an object. The object must be serializable in order to move the object to a different JVM.         com.objectspace.voyager.mobility.Imobility     moveTo(java.lang.Object destination)        Move the receiver to the JVM containing the specified object   moveTo(java.lang.String destinationURL)        Move the receiver to the JVM specified by the URL.         public static void mobile() throws Exception       {       Voyager.startup();       String serverClass =  ""whitney.voyager.examples.hello.HelloImpl"";       Proxy aProxy =  Factory.create( serverClass);       Hello helloProxy = (Hello) aProxy;       System.out.println( helloProxy.sayHello());       IMobility mover = Mobility.of( helloProxy );       mover.moveTo( ""//eli.sdsu.edu:8000"" );       System.out.println( helloProxy.sayHello());       mover.moveTo( ""//fargo.sdsu.edu:8000"" );       System.out.println( helloProxy.sayHello());       Voyager.shutdown();       }  Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 7      moveTo() Explained   This is taken from page 46-47 of Voyager ORB 3.0 Developer Guide.    1 Handling Messages       Current messages to the object are allowed to complete   New messages to the object are suspended       The code can only detect method calls that are  synchronized, so do not attempt to move an object that might be executing non-synchronized methods.    2. Moving the Object       The object is serialized and sent to the new location       This means that if the object is not serializable an exception will be thrown. You may wish to consider using proxies in the objects fields to reduce serializable problems. It also means that all the fields of the object are serialized and sent also.       java.rmi.Remote and com.objectspace.voyager.IRemote are ignored       This means that a Voyager object that is also an RMI server can be moved.    3. Keep forwarding address       The new addresses of the object and all of its non-transient parts are cached at the old location.    4. The old object is destroyed.  5. Suspended messages sent to the old object are resumed.  6. Updating old proxies       When a message sent via a proxy arrives at the old address of a moved object, a special exception containing the object’s new address is thrown back to the stale proxy. The proxy traps this exception, rebinds to the new address, and then resends the message to the updated address. If the program at the old location crashes before a stale proxy is updated, the stale proxy is unable to successfully rebind and a message sent via the proxy generates an  ObjectNotFoundException.   7. moveTo() returns      If an exception occurs in this process, the old object is restored to its original condition, suspended messages are resumed, and the exception is rethrown wrapped in a  MobilityException.  Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 8    Move Notification    Some objects need to be notified when they are about to be moved. Some object may need special processing before moving or after arriving. Some object may need the ability to cancel a move request.        com.objectspace.voyager.mobility.IMobile     An object that implements this interface will be informed when it is being moved with the following methods.   Note I have not been able get this to work yet. I have not determined if this a bug or an error on my part.   postArrival()       At this point, the copy of the object has become the real object, the object at the source has become the stale object, and the move is deemed successful and cannot be aborted.    postDeparture()       This method is executed on the original stale object at the source, and is typically defined to perform activities such as removing the stale object from persistence. Messages sent to the stale object via a proxy will be redirected to the new object, so postDeparture() should not utilize proxies to the original object or any of its facets. Note that because the user-supplied callback on the new object is executed using a fresh thread, it is possible for this postDeparture() to be executing concurrently with the user-supplied callback.    preArrival()throws MobilityException       This method is executed on the copy of the object at the destination. If the method throws a MobilityException, the move is aborted and no more IMobile callbacks occur       preDeparture(String source, String destination) throws MobilityException       This method is executed on the original object at the source. If the method throws a MobilityException, the move is aborted and no more IMobile callbacks occur.    Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 9    Mobile Agents   Use the com.objectspace.voyager.agent.Agent class to turn an object into an agent.      com.objectspace.voyager.agent.Agent Methods     static IAgent get(java.lang.Object object)        If the specified object implements IAgent, return the object.     static IAgent of(java.lang.Object object)        If the specified object implements IAgent, return the object.        com.objectspace.voyager.agent.IAgent Methods     getHome()  getResourceLoader()  isAutonomous()  moveTo(Object destination)  moveTo(Object destination,  String callback)  moveTo(Object destination, String callback, Object[] args)  moveTo(String destination)  moveTo(String destination, String callback)  moveTo(String destination, String callback, Object[] args)  setAutonomous(boolean flag)  setResourceLoader(IResourceLoader resourceLoader)  Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 10      Agent Example    package whitney.voyager.examples.agent; public interface IHello    {    String sayHello();    }  Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 11      HelloAgent    package whitney.voyager.examples.agent; import java.net.InetAddress; import com.objectspace.voyager.agent.*; import com.objectspace.voyager.mobility.*; import com.objectspace.voyager.*; public class HelloAgent implements IHello, java.io.Serializable    {    private int count = 0;        public  String sayHello()        {       return  ""Hello World from "" + getHostName() + "" count "" +  count++;       }    public void move( String newAddress ) throws MobilityException       {       System.out.println( ""Start move"" );       IAgent agentProxy = Agent.of( this );       agentProxy.moveTo( newAddress, ""movedDone"" );       }        public void movedDone()       {       System.out.println( ""I have moved"" + sayHello() );       IAgent agentProxy = Agent.of( this );              //rohan host name problem forced this odd check to see if we are home       if ( getHostName().startsWith( ""local"" );          System.out.println( ""I am home"" );       else          try             {             System.out.println( ""Going home"" );             move( agentProxy.getHome() );             }          catch (MobilityException moveProblem )             {             System.out.println( ""Trouble moving"" );             moveProblem.printStackTrace();             }       }  Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 12       HelloAgent Continued         public static void main( String[] arguments)       {       try           {          Voyager.startup( ""8000"" );          String serverClass =  ""whitney.voyager.examples.agent.HelloAgent"";          HelloAgent bond = new HelloAgent();          System.out.println( bond.sayHello());          bond.move( ""tcp://fargo.sdsu.edu:8000"" );                    // No shutdown to make sure the orb will get the return agent          }        catch (Exception e)           {          System.out.println(""HelloServer err: "");          e.printStackTrace();          }       }    }          protected static String getHostName()       {       try          {          return InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName();          }       catch (java.net.UnknownHostException who)          {          return ""Unknown"";          }       }  Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 13       Output on Rohan      Hello World from localhost count 0 Start move I have movedHello World from localhost count 2 I am home        Output on Fargo      I have movedHello World from fargo.sdsu.edu count 1 Going home Start move    Doc 34, Voyager Agent Basics Slide # 14    Voyager and Rohan   Voyager is located in /opt/voyager3/ on rohan.   You must add to your path /opt/voyager3/bin  You must add to your classpath /opt/voyager3/lib/voyager.jar to your classpath      Voyager and Rohan’s local host Problems    Voyager has the same problem with rohan’s host file setting as RMI. To use voyager on rohan or moria you must always explicitly reference rohan’s name. To state a voyager process on rohan via the command line use:       voyager tcp://rohan.sdsu.edu   or    voyager tcp://rohan.sdsu.edu:portNumber   To start a voyager process on rohan from inside a program use:     Voyager.startup( ""tcp://rohan.sdsu.edu:6000"" );            Copyright ©, All rights reserved .   1999 SDSU & Roger Whitney, 5500 Campanile Drive, San Diego, CA 92182-7700 USA.

clueweb09-en0007-88-26891	    What is it                What is it       Learn more       Get it       Developers            A framework for Python applications with graphical user interfaces.             Introduction   Kiwi consists of a set of classes and wrappers for  PyGTK  that were developed to provide a sort of framework for applications. Fully object-oriented, and roughly  Smalltalk's MVC ,  Kiwi provides a simple, practical way to build forms, windows and widgets that transparently access and display your object data.  Kiwi was primarily designed to make implementing the UI for  Stoq  easier, and it is released under the LGPL. Kiwi is inspired by Allen Holub's  Visual Proxy .   Kiwi is a framework and a set of enhanced PyGTK widgets designed to make building programs with graphical interfaces both easy to write and easy to maintain.  Kiwi is pure Python and should work cross-platform, but is developed on Python 2.4, Linux ix86.

Just a reminder KIWI is a project that changes very fast. In the coming time this document shall be extended and updated. The working environment in this document is a suggestion, like directories for the storage of images can be changed according to the users wish.    [ edit ]  Used system    Every opensuse 10.2 or sles 10.0 will do, But I used Opensuse 10.2 x86_64 with Xen installed so I could test the resulting qemu files and boot them.  Preferred situation  Make sure that you have enough diskspace for:  1) Repository of the installation source (4.3 GB if you make a copy of the DVD version) more if you have more repositories and architectures.  2) Enough diskspace for the build of the image (who is as big as you want it. Remember its a harddisk image..)  3) Enough diskspace for the build of the qemu and vmdk images, Kiwi makes standard both + a raw image + the initrd files. So you need at least 3 times the build harddisk space.    [ edit ]  Step 1 Getting Kiwi    The KIWI main repository is   http://ftp.opensuse.org/pub/opensuse/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools   Don't forget to take the right configuration for your system. In my case,  http://ftp.opensuse.org/pub/opensuse/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools/openSUSE_10.2/   And add the resource to yast, yum or smart    [ edit ]  Step 2 Install the Kiwi tools.     The full set of kiwi tools consists out of:                                                           -     kiwi                   - The primary program installed in /usr/sbin/kiwi                        - All modules and extra files are installed in /usr/share/kiwi kiwi-desc-isoboot      - Configuration files for iso-bootimages (LiveDVD/CD) installed in /usr/share/kiwi/images kiwi-desc-netboot      - Configuration files for net-bootimages (Netboot) installed in /usr/share/kiwi/images kiwi-desc-usbboot      - Configuration files for usb-bootimages (USBstick) installed in /usr/share/kiwi/images kiwi-desc-vmxboot      - Configuration files for vmx-bootimages (Qemu clients and VMDK clients (vmware)) installed in /usr/share/kiwi/images kiwi-desc-xenboot      - Configuration files for xen-bootimages (Xen Clients) installed in /usr/share/kiwi/images kiwi-desc-xennetboot   - Configuration files for xennetboot-bootimages (Xenimages booting from network) installed in /usr/share/kiwi/images kiwi-pxeboot           - Configuration files for pxe-bootimages (pxe bootimages) installed in /usr/share/kiwi/images   osc                    - OpenSUSE build service command-line tool  perl-Socket-MsgHdr     - Perl library used by kiwi richclient             - The base for the future graphical client   richclient-debuginfo   - Debug info graphical client         [ edit ]  Step 3 Creating the Kiwi image environment.     To grow your kiwi images you need to create a spacefull situation and some ingredients.    [ edit ]  The repositories.    You need at least one repository, these can be local or remote over nfs, ftp. It is going to connected by the smart packager so you can place it everywhere, or just use the installation repositories on the internet.  I use local repositories, because they are fast.   To create repository you just create a directory with a meaningful name and copy the contents of the DVD to this place.     Example's  /vm/repository/oss10.2 /vm/repository/oss10.2-64 /vm/repository/sles10 /vm/repository/sles10-64      [ edit ]  The kiwi image directories.    Do the same for your kiwi image directories     /vm/kiwi-build    - the directory where later the builds are created /vm/kiwi-image    - the directory where later the final images are created     [ edit ]  The image configuration directory.    Image configurations are in directory /usr/share/kiwi/images  There is a BETA example of the kiwi-desc-qemu-vmdk package is available in:   http://software.opensuse.org/download/home:/gwayne/openSUSE_10.2/noarch/   To have a basic configuration its easy to make a copy of the image configuration directory it provides.  cp -a qemu-vmdk-suse-10.2   This directory contains      root          - This directory contains all the files that shall be copied to the final image                 For example you can create directory etc and place your ntp.conf in it. Or your passwd/shadow files                   repo          - A extra repository directory where extra rpm files are placed used in the installation  config.sh     - Configuration file that contains the actions executed inside the chroot environment of the image. config.xml    - Configuration file of the image parameters.  build.sh      - My buildscript for lazy people, actually just the commands to build the full image.         [ edit ]  First modifications so that the system actually works.    There have to be modifications in two directories  Your own new image directory   /usr/share/kiwi/image/qemu-vmdk-suse-10.2-myownversion  And the boot image directory you are going to use   /usr/share/kiwi/image/vmxboot/suse-10.2  In both you have to change the source directories you use in the config.xml file.  The one in vmxboot             <repository type=""yast2"" status=""replaceable"">                 <!--<source path=""opensuse://10.2""/>-->         <source path=""/image/dist/full-10.2-i386""/>            <---------- change this one to your resources      And the one in qemu-vmdk-suse-10.2-myownversion extended to use two repositories, I added in this example the repo directory so you can add personal packages. You can also put a third one, with all updates. Just make sure that the updates are only the ones of the right architecture.                    <repository type=""rpm-dir"">         <source path=""this://repo""/>        </repository>         <repository type=""yast2"">                 <!--<source path=""/image/CDs/full-i386""/>-->                 <!--<source path=""/mounts/machcd2/consistent/full-i386""/>-->                 <!--<source path=""opensuse://SL-OSS-factory""/>-->                 <source path=""/vm/res/oss102""/>                   <---------------- change this one to your own resources         </repository>     Optional you can change the build.sh script to reflect the environment and be lazy in building.     configdir=/usr/share/kiwi/image/qemu-vmdk-suse-10.2-myownversion <---- change it to your config dir buildroot=/vm/kiwi-builds/oss102                                 <---- change it to where you want the build to be created imageroot=/vm/kiwi-images                                        <---- change it to where you want the images to be created  buildarch=i386                                  <---- because I build on a x86_64 system I have to tell him I want a i386 or x86_64 image                             # Remove buildroot before starting  cleanup=yes                                      <---- otherwise I get the error ""already exists"" when I rerun the image build.     So now you should be able to build a 2700 MB test image.  So you either start it with ./build.sh  or on a i386 machine, just replace the variables with your real directories. And start the commands by hand.     kiwi -r $buildroot -p $configdir kiwi -c $buildroot -d $imageroot     Now you should have a basic image, if you run it with vmware, xen or qemu it should install the bootloader on the first run and then you have a running image.  The root password is linux.    [ edit ]  Step 4 Creating your own specific Images.

One drawback to both approaches is that the skinned resources (SWF/PNG/GIF/etc. for graphical skins, the AS class file for programmatic skins) must be available at compile-time for the skins to be applied.  Or do they?  In this post I'll describe a neat trick for pulling in graphical skins at run-time (using a  live demo with source code ).                                To make this example as simple as possible, I'm going to create a  Flex app that allows the Button control to be dynamically skinned.  This app will pull down a skinning SWF at runtime, load the skins, and apply them to the Button control.  Again, to keep it simple I'm going to use the  skin template file  provided in  NJ's skinning article , and apply the RadioButton skins to the Button control.  (A tip of the cap to  Roger Gonzalez  and  NJ  for basically coming up with this solution.)                                 Step #1: Create a wrapper SWF for the skin assets                              The skin assets are in the aforementioned skin template file.  I want to create a wrapper SWF that my Flex app can load at runtime and from which it can extract the appropriate assets, in this case the four symbols for the RadioButton control.  Here's the source for wrapper SWF:                                package                               {    import flash.display.Sprite;                                   public class Wrapper extends Sprite    {      [Embed(source=""flex_skins.swf"",symbol=""RadioButton_upIcon"")]      public var rbUpSkin: Class;      [Embed(source=""flex_skins.swf"",symbol=""RadioButton_downIcon"")]      public var rbDownSkin: Class;      [Embed(source=""flex_skins.swf"",symbol=""RadioButton_disabledIcon"")]      public var rbDisabledSkin: Class;      [Embed(source=""flex_skins.swf"",symbol=""RadioButton_overIcon"")]      public var rbOverSkin: Class;    }          }                               Step #2: Put the wrapper SWF on your web server                              The Flex app needs to load the wrapper SWF from somewhere!                                Step #3: In your Flex app, use a Loader to load the wrapper SWF                                 I created a utility class called ClassLoader to wrap up functionality related to loading the SWF and extracting the class.  Here are the key lines:                                loader = new Loader();    loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler);    loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, ioErrorHandler);    loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR, securityErrorHandler);    ...                                 request = new URLRequest(swfLib);  var context:LoaderContext = new LoaderContext();  context.applicationDomain = new ApplicationDomain(ApplicationDomain.currentDomain);  loader.load(request, context);                                                                 Notice that the Loader loads the SWF into an  ApplicationDomain that has the current domain as its parent.  This is the key to ensuring that the app can access the loaded class and its assets.                                                               Step #4: Get the class  from the loaded SWF and instantiate it                                 Here we load the Class using an agreed-upon className (in this case, ""Wrapper""):                                var wrapperClass:Class = loader.contentLoaderInfo.applicationDomain.getDefinition(className) as Class;                               var wrapper:Object = new wrapperClass();                                                              Step #5: Apply the skins using setStyle                                You can apply the skins to a particular instance of Button or to all instances of Button.  Here's the latter approach:                                 StyleManager.getStyleDeclaration(""Button"").setStyle(""upSkin"", wrapper.rbUpSkin);    StyleManager.getStyleDeclaration(""Button"").setStyle(""downSkin"", wrapper.rbDownSkin);    StyleManager.getStyleDeclaration(""Button"").setStyle(""disabledSkin"", wrapper.rbDisabledSkin);    StyleManager.getStyleDeclaration(""Button"").setStyle(""overSkin"", wrapper.rbOverSkin);                                    Step #6: Run the app                                My sample app (running live  here , with ""View Source"" enabled) displays a text field where you can enter the URL of the wrapper SWF (also live  here ).  Enter the wrapper SWF's URL, click the ""Apply"" button, and you'll see that the button now looks like an oversized radio button.  As you mouse over or click on the button, you'll notice that its appearance changes to display the appropriate skin.  If you create your own wrapper SWF which exposes a different set of symbols with the same class names (rbUpSkin, etc.), you could point the sample app at it and have it load and display a different set of skins.                                                                 So why would you want to do this?  Dynamic skinning gives you one incredibly powerful benefit:   you can let your users put their skins on your app .  Imagine an MP3 player like  Winamp built in Flex.  The developer doesn't need to create a library of skins for the app, he/she can just expose a UI for setting the skin SWF (perhaps in the Preferences dialog) and let the user pick and choose from whatever skins the community comes up with. Equally important, the developer has fine-grained control over which controls can be skinned and which should retain their original skins (by only calling setStyle on the desired controls).  And last but not least, keeping the skins outside of the application SWF will keep the application file size from exploding as the skins proliferate (with a minor but certainly-acceptable-to-the-user performance hit when the skins are loaded).                                                                                                                                                                 Posted by Brian Riggs at 04:05 PM   |   Permalink                                   |  Comments (14)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           July 11, 2006                                                                         Notetag in Depth                                                                                        File under:  notetag , kiwi , adobe , flex , architecture , mashup Brian Riggs has penned an in-depth article  entitled "" NoteTag: Anatomy of a Flex mashup "", now available on Flex DevNet site, that unifies many of the blog entries here to describe the architecture behind Notetag.

Custom APIs and  modern protocols  are increasingly being built on top of HTTP.  Just as it's  rarely a good idea to invent a new XML language , it's increasingly apparent that HTTP, and more broadly  REST , is almost always the most appropriate foundation upon which to build new web APIs.    So how does ActionScript 3 stack up in the area of HTTP support?  I'll (arbitrarily) give a score to AS3's support for the core elements of a minimal HTTP implementation.    Methods    AS3's  HTTPService  class supports the basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE), but doesn't allow custom methods.  The  WebDAV protocol  uses a handful of custom HTTP methods (PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, etc.) which HTTPService would be unable to invoke, so it may be a while before we see an AS3-based WebDAV implementation.    Score: 4/5  (Support for custom methods is missing, but few APIs use them anyhow)    Request headers    HTTPService has a headers property which can hold an arbitrary Array of name-value pairs.    Score: 5/5    Response headers    Unfortunately, there's no way to extract the headers from an HTTP response.  (If you're interested in verifying this, just make an HTTPService call to a bogus page and set a breakpoint in the fault handler.  When execution stops there, examine the FaultEvent in Flex Builder's Variables window -- there's no evidence anywhere that the error is indeed a 404.)  I had a conversation with  Matt Chotin  of the Flex team about this some months ago, and he indicated that not all browsers expose the headers.      This is a pretty significant limitation, especially since REST principles are motivating the designers of  more recent protocols  and APIs to leverage the HTTP status code vocabulary to define the semantics of method results, rather than invent new vocabularies in the form of custom responses.    Score: 1/5  (I'll give it one point, since at least it's possible to distinguish between  successful calls  and  unsuccessful calls .)    Authentication    HTTPService supports authentication against a remote endpoint via the setRemoteCredentials method.  Alternatively, the user's credentials can be specified in Flex Data Server's proxy-service.xml file.    Score: 5/5    Overall: 15/20    With the glaring exception of support for response headers, AS3's support for HTTP is full-featured enough to implement just about any REST-style protocol or API.  Let's hope the Flex and Apollo teams can fill this one remaining hole in a future release.

Sun announced the product family in October 2007. [ 1 ]  The first release of the management component, Sun xVM Ops Center, was available in February 2008. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Products     1.1   Sun xVM Server   1.2   Sun xVM VirtualBox   1.3   Sun xVM Ops Center   1.4   Sun VDI software       2   OpenxVM   3   References   4   External links               [ edit ]   Products     [ edit ]   Sun xVM Server       Main article:  Xen              xVM Server Logo       The xVM Server uses a bare-metal  hypervisor  based on the open source  Xen  under a  Solaris  environment on  x86-64  systems. On  SPARC  systems, xVM is based on Sun's  Logical Domains  and Solaris. Sun plans to support  Microsoft Windows  (on x86-64 systems only),  Linux , and Solaris as guest  operating systems .   Sun xVM Server provides various features from Sun's  OpenSolaris  underlying the guest OS, including Predictive Self Healing,  ZFS ,  DTrace , advanced network bandwidth management (from the OpenSolaris  Crossbow  project) as well as security enhancements. [ 3 ]   Instead of having its own disk image format, Sun xVM Server will import/export  VMDK   [ 4 ]  and  VHD  images to facilitate interoperation with  VMware ESX Server  and Microsoft's  Hyper-V .   On September 10, 2008, Sun announced [ 5 ]  the availability of xVM server source code on its project page  [ 6 ] .     [ edit ]   Sun xVM VirtualBox           VirtualBox           Main article:  VirtualBox       VirtualBox  is x86 virtualization software installed on an existing host operating system such as  Solaris ,  Windows ,  Linux  or  Mac OS X ; it allows running additional operating systems, each known as a ""Guest OS"", each with its own virtual environment.   VirtualBox inside the xVM product line is intended to be the starting point for developers to create and test their virtual machines before deploying them on the xVM Server environment, allowing them to be created on any of the supported ""Host OSes"". Also, since version 1.6.0, VirtualBox can run under the constrains of a  Solaris Container , expanding the number of operating systems that can be run inside each Container and manage the resources from each OS individually through the Container. Further integration is expected to arrive at a later version integrating better with the Crossbow project  [3] , enhancing the networking capabilities of the VirtualBox Container.  [ 7 ]   VirtualBox can also be used in a standalone fashion, allowing users of an operating system to use and develop software for other OSes by virtualizing. In this way, VirtualBox is comparable to  Microsoft Virtual PC ,  VMware Workstation  and  Parallels Workstation .     [ edit ]   Sun xVM Ops Center   The Sun xVM Ops Center is a datacenter automation tool that simplifies discovery and management of physical and virtualized assets. Among its features it can: [ 3 ]     Provide a single console for the management of both the physical and virtual infrastructure in a virtualized environment       Allow discovery of any existing infrastructure, including hardware that has just been unpacked and plugged in but has not been switched on       Power everything up and then provision this hardware with firmware, operating system  hypervisors  and other applications as required       Once operational, ensure that all the software on the servers, both physical and virtualized, can be automatically updated and patched       Enable custom reports to be generated for operational as well as compliance purposes.     The upcoming release includes a browser-based, platform-independent interface that uses  AJAX  for its rich interactivity.     [ edit ]   Sun VDI software   Sun VDI ( Virtual Desktop Infrastructure ) software is a connection broker that provides desktop virtualization to replace fully featured machines with virtual images on a server that are controlled remotely on a thin client such as Sun's  Sun Ray , or any other computer with  Java . [ 8 ] . Sun VDI supports lifecycle management and the ability to monitor resource usage and dynamically turn them [ clarification needed ]  off for each assigned virtual machine (guest OSes).   It can be used with Sun's thin clients using the  Appliance Link Protocol  (ALP) as its display protocol. ALP is comparable to  Citrix 's XenDesktop (previously known as Presentation Server) and Microsoft's  Remote Desktop Protocol  (RDP). [ 9 ] . In 2008 VMware announced a similar integrated solution consisting of VMware VDI and Sun Ray Software solution. [ 10 ]   VMware Infrastructure 3 Server (VI3) is supported, with plans for integration with Sun xVM Server. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OpenxVM   At this moment, OpenxVM consists of two core projects [ 12 ] :     xVM Server   xVM  VirtualBox     Source code for the  Common Agent Container  component is available from the OpenxVM.org community. Sun plans to release the rest of the Sun xVM Ops Center source code under the  GNU General Public License  version 3 (GPLv3).

Managing servers and storage in complex, heterogeneous environments is complex and expensive. Customers choosing to deploy  Sun N1 System Manager , Sun Management Center, and, now,  Sun xVM Ops Center  or other components in the Sun software management software stack will benefit from comprehensive system and virtualization management tuned for Sun systems. However, many customers have invested in existing processes, procedures, and tools that do not allow them to leverage Sun management software at this time. To date, customers have faced additional challenges in integrating Sun servers into their data center environment, such as:         Integration issues : Data center administrators might experience additional tasks when they attempt to integrate unfamiliar server management interfaces with their existing third party management interfaces. At a minimum, there are additional tasks, time, and cost involved in making the server and the management tool work together.      Functionality issues : The most immediate approaches to integrating new servers with third party management programs are not   necessarily the most functional, efficient, robust, or scalable. Even when data center administrators get their new Sun servers   working with a third party management program, achieving a consistent level of functionality can be difficult.      Support issues : When customers do the work to integrate a server with their existing management tool, there are no guarantees that the custom integration solution for a third party management program will work across future software and firmware updates. Every additional custom or unique integration solution increases the number of points of failure, maintenance issues, and IT management complexity.      Sun 3PMIs for Sun system hardware are a direct response to these customer challenges. They address the need to enable the rapid integration of Sun system hardware into a customer's larger data center management scheme. However, it should be noted that this strategy does not represent a departure from Sun's commitment to deliver the tools needed to effectively manage Sun products; it is a compatible and complementary extension to this commitment.    Customers can choose to use all Sun tools, all third party tools, or a combination of both in the following ways:        At the managed server level : Regardless of whether customers choose to monitor their Sun servers through operating system agents or service processors, the same industry-standard protocols, such as SNMP, IPMI, or the use of syslog, are available generally across the Sun server product line. Sun 3PMIs generally do not require that third party, specific management agents or services be installed on managed Sun servers, nor do they preclude this option; it is a customer's choice.      At the system management tool level : Customers can now deploy Sun servers into their heterogeneous data center management environments independent of composition.                Sun management tools : Sun xVM Ops Center, Sun Management Center, and Sun N1 System Manager provide a suite of end-to-end management, provisioning, virtualization management capabilities for customers who continue to leverage their investment in the Sun management software stack. These customers can continue to work in this environment without feeling that they cannot integrate their Sun servers with non-Sun systems management solutions if they choose to do so.          Third party tools : Customers running one or more of the management tools listed earlier can now deploy Sun servers with confidence, knowing that the integration with these tools is pre-tested, simpler to deploy, documented, and supported. Furthermore, the tools will continue to operate when Sun updates existing systems and adds new ones. Their investments in their data center management solutions and their investments in Sun servers are complementary; no tradeoffs or compromises are necessary.                Sun continues to be committed to customer choice in management and to enabling choice through open, industry-standard server management interfaces that work with both Sun's industry leading management tools and also with key third party tools that customers might have chosen to deploy.     The Sun 3PMI initiative is all about achieving alignment and consistency that customers can understand and trust. If Sun gets the management interfaces and services right (see Figure 1), Sun can deliver open, scalable, and reasonably simple solutions.                    Figure 1: Management Interfaces and Services           (Click to Enlarge)      With the introduction of 3PMIs, Sun follows through on its commitments to meet and exceed customer expectations for system management solutions wherever customers are with whatever they are running.     So why is Sun developing 3PMIs?  Unlike competitors that may require the use of their proprietary management tools, Sun believes in enabling customer choice when it comes to the deployment of Sun's world-class servers.    Not only does Sun offer best-of-breed Sun management tools, industry-standard server management interfaces, and service processor (SP) technology, but Sun has also taken the next step of pre-testing these interfaces with third party management tools, delivering them in usable packages, and supporting add-ons, when necessary, to make integration as simple as possible. Sun 3PMIs simplify and standardize the process of deploying Sun servers into data centers running third party management programs. As more Sun servers and more third party management programs get added to the support matrix, the costs of deploying Sun servers in these environments goes down and the demonstrated value and performance of Sun systems goes up.     3 Which Sun Servers and Third Party Management Programs Are Supported?    This section provides an overview of the Sun servers and third party management programs supported by Sun 3PMIs.    If one third party management program satisfied every customer requirement for data center management, there would not be 20-30 packages out there. The Sun 3PMI effort integrates the OS-level and SP-level management technologies in Sun servers with the various system management technologies and protocols implemented by the third party management program vendors. Sun 3PMIs adapt and integrate  what Sun has  to  what customers expect  and require. The following information explains the support matrix between Sun servers and the supported third party management programs.    Figure 2 and the  Integration with Third Party System Management ISV Tools web page  show the most complete and up-to-date listing of supported 3PMIs and supported servers.                Figure 2: Integration with Third Party System Management ISV Tools Web Page           (Click to Enlarge)       3.1 Which Sun Servers Are Supported?     This section provides an overview of the types of Sun servers that have been integrated with third party management programs.    To some extent, the product line names and model names for Sun servers do not provide much insight into how well they can be integrated with third party management programs. What really counts in the system management space is their support for industry-standard systems management protocols, such as SNMP and IPMI.    Next, Sun servers are categorized based on the systems management protocols and technologies they support, and then information is provided that shows how those categories of servers are supported by the third party management programs.     General Categories of Supported Servers     As shown in Table 1, all the Sun servers supported by the integration packs fall into four categories differentiated by architecture (x64 or SPARC) and by service processor type: Advanced Lights Out Manager (ALOM), Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM), or Embedded Lights Out Manager (Embedded LOM). Although Sun 3PMIs monitor these servers through SNMP, IPMI, and syslog interfaces, there are other types of management interfaces and services available in third party management programs. Sun 3PMIs attempt to simplify the process of managing the variables of supported servers, supported third party management programs, and supported management interfaces.           Table 1: General Categories of Supported Servers             Category   Description   Examples                x64 servers with ILOM             x64 servers and blade server modules with the ILOM service processor, hereafter referenced as x64/ILOM servers.         These servers are monitored at the service processor level.              Sun Fire X4100 M2 Server         Sun Fire X4600 M2 Server         Sun Blade X6220 Server Module          Sun Blade X8440 Server Module                  SPARC servers with ILOM             Solaris OS-based SPARC servers and blade server modules with the ILOM service processor, hereafter referenced as SPARC/ILOM servers.          These servers can be monitored at either the service processor level or at the operating system level through the Sun SNMP Management Agent for Sun Fire and Netra Systems.              Sun SPARC Enterprise T5120 Server         Sun SPARC Enterprise T5220 Server                 x64 servers with Embedded LOM             x64 servers and blade server modules with the Embedded LOM service processor, hereafter referenced as x64/ELOM servers.

Sun SPARC Enterprise T1000 Server          Sun SPARC Enterprise T2000 Server                      3PMI Support Matrix    In an ideal world, every possible combination of Sun server and 3PMI would be supported and updated continuously. Short of that, the good news is that most recent Sun servers and service processors are supported by the Sun 3PMIs.    Refer to this  complete and current listing of supported Sun servers, service processors, and service processor firmware  before installing the integration package. Table 2 shows the matrix of Sun server types to 3PMIs.

This section introduces the Sun 3PMIs. Each third party management program offers a different user interface and a different set of tools and services for monitoring Sun servers.         BMC Patrol Enterprise Manager Version 4.4.0        The Sun Servers Integration 2.0 for BMC PATROL Enterprise Manager provides integration between Sun x64/ILOM, SPARC/ILOM, and SPARC/ALOM servers and BMC Patrol Enterprise Manager 4.4.0. The Sun integration provides some value-adds, for example, an SNMP Heartbeat Module that periodically checks all the nodes registered with the integration. If a monitored node fails to respond, the heartbeat module generates an alert.         Once Sun events are integrated with a third party management program, all the available tools for viewing and analyzing become available. The tools shown in the BMC Patrol Enterprise Console (Figure 3) are representative of these analytic services.                Figure 3: BMC PATROL Enterprise Console           (Click to Enlarge)           CA Unicenter NSM Release 3.x and Release r11      The Sun Servers Integration 2.1 for CA Unicenter NSM provides integration between Sun x64/ILOM, x64/ELOM, SPARC/ILOM, and SPARC/ALOM servers and CA Unicenter Release 3.x and Release r11. CA Unicenter NSM displays Sun-specific SNMP traps in the WorldView (WV), Management Command Center (MCC), or Enterprise Management (EM) consoles. The Sun integration also uses SNMPget to poll the names and status of server sensors and to display that information in sensor tree diagrams or topological maps.        Figure 4 illustrates the way the 3PMI for CA Unicenter NSM polls Sun server sensors dynamically and builds a tree displaying the real-time status of each sensor.                 Figure 4: CA Unicenter NSM           (Click to Enlarge)           HP OpenView Operations 8.24 for UNIX        The Sun Servers Integration 1.1 for HP OpenView Operations for UNIX provides integration between Sun x64/ILOM, SPARC/ILOM, and SPARC/ALOM servers and HP OpenView Operations 8.24 for UNIX. The Sun integration provides both SNMP v1 and v2c trap-based monitoring, and it reports detailed information about Sun server sensor names and event severity for environmental and component-related events.        Figure 5 illustrates how Sun service processors and Sun servers can provide a summary picture of their overall health to a third party management program such as HP OpenView Operations for UNIX.                Figure 5: HP OpenView Operations for UNIX           (Click to Enlarge)           HP OpenView Operations 7.5 for Windows        The Sun Servers Integration 1.0 for HP OpenView Operations for Windows provides trap-based integration between Sun x64/ILOM, x64/ELOM, SPARC/ILOM, and SPARC/ALOM servers and HP OpenView Operations 7.5 for Windows. The Sun integration provides automatic acknowledgement of warning and error messages received from ILOM 2.0 service processors and the Solaris MASF Agent. A custom VB script provides automatic parsing of hardware sensor names from SNMP traps received from x64/ELOM servers.         Figure 6 illustrates how multiple Sun server types are integrated with HP OpenView Operations for Windows. Events from each of these Sun server types are displayed in the Microsoft Management Console that is integrated with HP OpenView Operations for Windows.                Figure 6: HP OpenView Operations for Windows           (Click to Enlarge)             HP Systems Insight Manager Version 5.0        The Sun integration for HP Systems Insight Manager does not depend on any integration files that Sun ships; it is entirely a configuration procedure that customers can perform for themselves. Once configured, HP Systems Insight Manager Version 5.0 uses SNMP and WBEM to monitor Sun x64/ILOM, x64/ELOM, and SPARC/ILOM servers.         Figure 7 illustrates how different types of Sun service processors can be monitored by HP Systems Insight Manager. Sun ILOM in particular provides robust information about sensors and indicators on both x64/ILOM and SPARC/ILOM servers.                 Figure 7: HP Systems Insight Manager           (Click to Enlarge)             IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console Version 3.9        The Sun Servers Integration 1.1 for IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console provides integration between Sun x64/ILOM, x64/ELOM, SPARC/ILOM, and SPARC/ALOM servers and IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console 3.9. The Sun integration identifies alerts by source (Sun server) and monitors the number and severity levels of those alerts. Sun-specific rules manage alerts received from multiple sources by providing automatic event clearing, event selection pruning (duplicate messages), and event severity marking (normalizing the status labels and colors for messages generated by multiple sources).         Figure 8 illustrates the first of many levels of event details that Sun service processors can provide a third party management program such as IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console.                 Figure 8: IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console           (Click to Enlarge)             IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.1        The Sun Servers Integration 1.0 for IBM Tivoli Monitoring provides integration between Sun x64/ILOM, SPARC/ILOM, and SPARC/ALOM servers and IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.1. Sun-specific rules in the Sun integration display and prioritize alerts received from multiple sources.         Figure 9 illustrates how IBM Tivoli Monitoring can build charts full of information about Sun-specific events.                Figure 9: IBM Tivoli Monitoring           (Click to Enlarge)            IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Version 7.2        The Sun Servers Integration 1.0 for IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus provides integration between Sun x64/ILOM, x64/ELOM, SPARC/ILOM, and SPARC/ALOM servers and IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Version 7.2. The Sun integration identifies alerts by source (Sun server) and provides Sun-specific rules for displaying and prioritizing alerts received from multiple sources. It automatically clears problem events received from supported Sun servers and service processors when a resolution event is received.         Figure 10 illustrates how IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus can display and categorize traps from several Sun MIBs: platform OS events, PET traps, and HW traps.                 Figure 10: IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus           (Click to Enlarge)             Microsoft Operations Manager 2005        The Sun Servers Integration 3.1 for Microsoft Operations Manager 2005 provides integration between Sun x64/ILOM and x64/ELOM servers and Microsoft Operations Manager 2005. The Sun integration also provides Task Wizards to support frequently performed tasks.         Figure 11 illustrates how the 3PMI for Microsoft Operations Manager 2005 provides information to the network topography view in Microsoft Operations Manager. Sun servers are identified, classified, and arranged appropriately. Detailed information about the model and configuration of each discovered Sun server is also available in this view.                 Figure 11: Microsoft Operations Manager           (Click to Enlarge)            4 How Do the Integrations Work?    This section provides an overview of the general theory of operation for Sun 3PMIs.    No single enterprise systems management package satisfies every data center requirement in the field. That's one reason why Sun competitors such as IBM and HP have multiple offerings in this space. If IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console is not a perfect match for a data center, perhaps IBM Tivoli Monitoring or IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus will fit the bill. Although most of the third party systems management packages depend on the SNMP protocol and varieties of logfile forwarding to monitor servers, their individual implementations of those technologies can be very, very different. Although the majority of 3PMIs use events as the medium for monitoring Sun servers, there are also 3PMIs, such as the Sun integration for CA Unicenter Network and Systems Management, that poll device properties and build custom views of those results. This section focuses on the common denominators: events.    At a  low level , 3PMIs must adapt to the architectures and technologies peculiar to each integration. At a  high level , there is a general consistency to the way the 3PMIs move events and other messages from Sun servers into each of the third party system management packages. Table 3 and Figure 12 provide an overview of 3PMI operation.          Table 3: Overview of 3PMI Operation             Processing   Process   Description         Sun server   SPARC/Solaris MASF Agent   The MASF Agent installed on a SPARC/Solaris server forwards events and messages from the Sun  ENTITY-MIB.mib  and  SUN-PLATFORM-MIB.mib  using the SNMP protocol through a network port. Management packages and agents listen for events forwarded from that same port.              ILOM or Embedded LOM Service Processor   ILOM and Embedded LOM service processors support their own embedded operating systems, so you can monitor your Sun server through its service processor regardless of whether you have installed Microsoft Windows, the Solaris OS, or Linux as its host operating system. Sun service processors forward events and messages from the  SUN-ILOM-PET-MIB.mib  or  SUN-HW-TRAP-MIB.mib  through a network management port. Management packages and agents listen for events forwarded from that same port.             SNMP or logfile events   The SNMP events forwarded by the MASF agent or by your service processor contain information about the Sun server generating the event, the sensor or service initiating the event, event severity, and other Sun-specific information. The third party management program uses a management agent or logfile adapter to process forwarded logfile events.         Data center   Third party management agents   Each third party management program uses a different set of agents, probes, or services running on a network server to collect and process all the events received from the MASF agent or Sun service processor.             Sun-specific event rules files   The format that each third party management program uses to store and display events is different. 3PMIs usually install and configure rule files or libraries that assist the third party management package in interpreting the raw events and messages and in structuring them correctly for the management database.              Third party management database   Once an event has been processed and structured by a management agent or probe, it gets added to a centrally managed database repository of events and messages.              Event console   Customers ultimately interact with the management database when they view events for particular Sun servers or respond to error or warning messages.                                   Figure 12: How Integrations Work           (Click to Enlarge)      Subsequent sections examine in more detail how each 3PMI operates.      4.1 What Kinds of Sun Server Events Are Monitored?    This section explains the types of events that can be sent to a third party management package from Sun servers.    The ultimate source of all information that appears in the event console of a third party management package is generated by sensors and management services running on individual Sun servers. 3PMIs add value when they interpret messages from Sun servers when those messages are received by the third party management package. 3PMIs do not create additional messages.     To understand what sorts of events a 3PMI and its third party management package can monitor on Sun servers, you need to look at the three types of information generated by Sun servers and service processors. The following examples describe the most sophisticated information source, the ILOM 2.x service processor. The MASF and Embedded LOM messages are comparable.    Here are the three categories of information generated by Sun servers and forwarded through to Sun 3PMIs:         Sensor readings : System component temperatures, current, voltage, speed, and presence. The complete list of sensors for a particular server is viewable in its ILOM graphical interface, as shown in Figure 13.                 Figure 13: Sensor Readings           (Click to Enlarge)          The detailed properties for each sensor are viewable as well. Figure 14 shows how ILOM displays detailed properties for the /SYS/MB/T_AMB temperature sensor on a Sun Fire X4200 server motherboard.                 Figure 14: Detailed Sensor Properties           (Click to Enlarge)            System indicators : Status (on, off, blinking, and so on). The complete list of system indicators for a particular server is viewable in its ILOM graphical user interface, as shown in Figure 15.                Figure 15: System Indicators           (Click to Enlarge)            System alerts : IPMI Platform Event Traps (PETs) and SNMP traps. The rules for sending system alerts for a particular server are configurable in the ILOM graphical user interface, as shown in Figure 16.                Figure 16: System Alerts           (Click to Enlarge)          For example, when the ILOM 2.0 service processor sends an SNMP trap with Alert ID1 to the management server at IP address 10.18.163.137, the 3PMI installed and configured on that management server interprets this raw trap for the third party management program running on that management server.         Customers receive accurately formatted, typed, and annotated messages when they view them in the event browser of the third party management program. For example, Figure 17 shows how IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console displays events from Sun servers that have been interpreted by the Sun Server Integration for IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console.                Figure 17: Events Displayed in IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console           (Click to Enlarge)            The more robust and consistent the sensor events, indicator events, and system alerts being generated across the Sun server product line, the more accurately the third party management programs provide a picture of the status and health of Sun servers.      5 Where Do I Get More Information?

Wichtiger erscheint mir folgender Eintrag:  O4 - HKLM\..\Run: [soundmanager] soundman.exe   Er knte auf  diesen Backdoor-Trojaner  hinweisen.

Aurdem ist Dein System nicht up to date.  SP2 fehlt!!  cacatoa                                                        __________________       Der Mensch sollte eine Hundeseele haben!

clueweb09-en0001-56-25614	              skip to main   |        skip to sidebar               Green's Opinion                                     Monday, September 8, 2008         Beyond Rich Text (Part 2): Displaying Images in an SWT StyledText        Recently  I wrote about a few simple tricks  that make it possible to display more than just text in a StyledText widget.  In this article I take it a step further: displaying images in an SWT StyledText widget. Normally a StyledText widget cannot display images.  Why would you want to display images in a text control, you might ask?  Well, there are cases where a rich text control is used to render text which may have embedded images.  Take for example the  Mylyn  task editor.  It displays bug descriptions and comments.  In some repositories (such as Trac or JIRA) it's possible to use markup to display rich text and images.  It's common to see screenshots or other visual data included in bug reports. To display images in a StyledText we use a small variation on the tricks from  my previous post .  Previously I used an annotation to mark the location of the thing I wanted to draw, and a painter to paint it.  This approach works well when we know the size of the thing we're about to draw (such as a character or horizontal rule).  In the case of images, it gets more complicated.  We need to know the size of the image so that we can create enough space for it in the text.   Since loading image data can be slow (over a network or from a busy disk) we must load the image asynchronously and render it when it becomes available.  We can get away with it since users are used to this experience -- that's how web browsers work. So here's a run-down of the technique I used: Mark the location of the image with an annotation Asynchronously download the image When the image becomes available, determine its height (in pixels) Determine the font in use at the annotated location Using font metrics compute the number of blank lines required to create enough vertical space (in pixels) to display the image without obscuring text Insert the required number of newlines into the text widget Adjust text presentation offsets (some styled regions may need to be translated by the same number of characters as we inserted in the previous step) Associate the image data with the annotation so that the painter will have access to it Cause the text widget to repaint Use the custom painter to paint the image in the empty space that we created Here's a screenshot demonstrating this technique in action: It works!  The SWT StyledText can now display images! Though the result is pleasing, there remain a few issues with this approach: Images don't flow with the text, that is we can't wrap text around the image on the left or right side, only above and below. Images aren't included in clipboard operations such as copy and paste. If you're interested in the code involved in this technique  you can find it here . The fact that we can do this using standard JFace and SWT APIs is a testament to the quality and completeness of the platform.  Thanks Eclipse!

Christian, The patch itself contains all of the relevant code.  I'm hoping to see the patch applied within a week or two.   If you'd like to see it working for now you'll need to  follow these instructions  to get the sources from CVS and then apply the patch.

I don't know why...  But the fix is simple.  Change the above line so that it checks to see if the logger is null (which it should probably be doing):    Base.logger.info ""Migrating to #{migration} (#{migration.version})"" unless Base.logger.nil?     Since this ""bug"" has persisted for years, I assume this is a problem that others are not hitting. Logging works in my development and production environments, so logger should not be null in this case.    *shrug*    Life goes on.    Anyone else hitting this problem with rake db:migrate?

Jan 16      2008                A Class Inspection Trick for Ruby                           Tags:             Programming                         Ruby on Rails                              I was struggling with SOAP for the first time today. No, today is  not  the first day I bathe! SOAP is some crazy XML communication protocol that seems like overkill to me.    Anyway, I was using Ruby to send and receive the request, and I was getting a baffling SOAP::Mapping::Object object, and I had no idea how to use it. It's a class with dynamically generated methods, and none of the ones I was expecting to see were there.     Blogosphere to the rescue!  Marty Haught's Weblog gave a simple trick  that saved the day and helped me narrow down my problem to let me see the solution within minutes.    To inspect the resulting object, I was looking at the output of this:  @results.public_methods.sort.join(' ')   Which gives a huge list of methods.    Thanks to Marty, I did this instead:  (@results.public_methods - Object.public_methods).sort.join(' ')   Subtracting Object.public_methods removes all the methods that all Ruby objects get, showing me only the methods that are different. I got this list:  [] []= __add_xmlele_value __xmlattr __xmlele out out=   Sure enough, the ""out"" method stood out, so I investigated it. A few minutes later, I had navigated through the class and found what I needed. Sweet!    I post this here so that others might discover this simple trick and solve whatever problem is keeping them up late at night.                                                     Comment on this article.                                 Sep 15      2007                Windows Search For All Files                           Tags:             Programming                         Rants                               Here's a tip that programmers might appreciate. Coders dealing with huge projects rely on search quite a bit, especially when they need to make project-wide changes.    Say you use a function named  do_something_that_crashes() . At some point in time you may need to find all instances of that function and remove it. It could be in dozens of files. Hundreds even!    On UNIX or using cygwin, you could find all files containing that function using the  find  command. On a Mac, it's even easier: you just use  Spotlight  (with plugins like  this one ). Why can't every operating system have Spotlight?? On Windows, you have the crappiest search capability of any operating system: that stupid orange dog that couldn't find a dead bird to save his life.    The problem is that Windows search ignores files with extensions that it doesn't understand. So, if you're a web programmer trying to search through all your  .php  files, Windows won't be able to do it. Ruby on Rails programmer? Windows will ignore all your  .rb ,  .rhtml , and  .rxml  files. And even better, it will make it look like it searched them but didn't find anything! It will proudly say, ""Nope, those files don't contain what you're looking for."" You can easily test this. Open one of your files, choose a word that you find in the file, and then tell that inept Windows search dog to find the word in the file. It will happily tell you that the file doesn't contain that word. Your eyes deceive you! Trust Windows!                Click to continue reading...                   This problem isn't limited to programming language files. It could affect anyone who doesn't use Microsoft software, or file types that Microsoft doesn't care about.    Well, I found  a Microsoft Support article that tells you how to fix this problem . You can tell Windows to look in every file, even the ones that Windows would rather ignore. You are warned that this will slow down Windows Search, because it means that Windows Search will actually be doing what you asked it to do! Wouldn't you rather that the search finish immediately and give you no results? I mean, why would you want to wait 30 seconds only to find what you're looking for?    Windows XP instructions:    1. Click  Start , and then click  Search .  2. Click  Change preferences  above the dog's ugly face, and then click  With Indexing Service (for faster local searches) .  3. Click  Change Indexing Service Settings (Advanced) .  4. In the ""Indexing Service"" window that pops up, click the third icon from the left with the tooltip that says  Show/Hide Console Tree .  5. In the left pane, right-click  Indexing Service on Local Machine , and then click Properties.  6. Yet another window will pop up. On the Generation tab, put a check mark in the  Index files with unknown extensions  check box.  7. Click OK. It is now done.  8. Close the ""Indexing Service"" window.    Here's an optional set of instructions, which is preferable for web programming:    1. Go buy a Mac.  2. Use your Windows PC for playing games.                                                              1 comments on this article.

In this blog, I have one page for every article I write. I also have a page for each month, and a page for each year. I also have a page for each tag which lists all the articles with those tags. It isnt too much, so  Google's web crawler  can keep up with it and get everything indexed.    But I have another site with hundreds of individual pages, and Googles crawler stops indexing the site after only a few dozen pages, missing the important ones. If one of my pages isn't in Google's index, then it isn't working for me! It's just wasting hard drive space. It was obvious that I needed to tell Google what to crawl by giving it a sitemap. Read  Google's docs about sitemaps , and be familiar with  Google's Webmaster Tools  in order to use submit sitemaps. Basically, a sitemap acts as a table of contents for Google, so it can understand which pages it should be looking at when it visits your site.    Because Rails is so awesome, theres an easy way to generate sitemaps using Ruby. It should only take you a few minutes to write your sitemap code once you have a look at how its done. Ill give a brief overview here.                Click to continue reading...                   In the same way that you can generate HTML files using .rhtml files, you can create XML files using .rxml. First, lets look at Googles sitemap format to see what kind of XML document we need to build. Heres an example sitemap:    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>  <urlset xmlns=""http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"">    <url>      <loc>http://www.geekskillz.com/tags/1</loc>      <priority>0.9</priority>      <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>    </url>    <url>      <loc>http://www.geekskillz.com/tags/2</loc>      <priority>0.8</priority>      <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>    </url>    ...  </urlset>   Each page you want Google to crawl is contained in a  url  element, which contains a mandatory  loc  element and a bunch of optional elements. I use the  priority  element so that the more important pages get crawled if Google is too lazy to crawl my entire site, which is usually what happens. Its like saying, Please index this one first, and if you have time, here are the other ones you should index.    Priority is a value between 0 and 1, and the values are compared with each other. So setting all your urls to a priority of 1.0 is pointless. 1.0 doesn't mean that your web pages are super important. It would mean that all your pages are equally important in relation to each other, which doesnt help the web crawler at all. It wants to know where it should start crawling, not how important you think your web page is compared to everyone else on the internet. We know your mom says you're special, but Google doesn't consider her to be credible on these matters.    The  changefreq  element is another hint to Google, suggesting how often it should return to find new content on your website. Its something that might get ignored, but its probably worth using. Googles sitemap documentation says that these hints may be ignored, so dont spend too much time thinking about them.    Now to the Ruby code. To create a sitemap that keeps up to date on your sites content, you can use a .rxml file. I named mine sitemap.rxml. The file is written in Ruby, and uses the  xml  object to create the XML elements in the output. Heres a small example that shows how it basically works:    xml.instruct! :xml, :version=>""1.0""   xml.outside{    xml.inside(""Hello World!"")  }    This creates this output XML file:    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>  <outside>    <inside>Hello World!</inside>  </outside>   So, you create an element by calling the  xml  object with the name of the element you want to create (""outside"" and ""inside"" in the above example). To put a value inside the element, you pass it in as an argument (like ""Hello World!"" in the example). Easy pickings!    And really, thats all you need to learn to start building your sitemap. So, heres an example .rxml file that creates a sitemap:    xml.instruct! :xml, :version=>""1.0""   xml.urlset(:xmlns => ""http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9""){    # High priority pages:    @important_tags.each do |tag|      xml.url{        xml.loc(""http://www.website.com"" + tag_path(tag))        xml.priority(0.9)        xml.changefreq(""weekly"")      }    end        # Low priority pages:    # We want the priority value to range from 0.2 to 0.8    @priority_multiplier = 0.6 / @low_pri_pages.size.to_f      @ low_pri_pages.each_with_index do |tag, i|      xml.url{        xml.loc(""http://www. website.com"" + tag_path(tag))        priority = 0.8 - (i * @priority_multiplier)        xml.priority( ""%.2f"" % priority )      }    end  }   This is doing something a bit fancy with the priority value. The @low_pri_pages array has been sorted (in the controller) in order of most important to least important (based on some criteria). Then the priority value is calculated based on the order of the array. So when this .rxml file is run, well get something like this:      ...    <url>      <loc>http://www.website.com/tags/10</loc>      <priority>0.72</priority>    </url>    <url>      <loc>http://www. website.com/tags/11</loc>      <priority>0.71</priority>    </url>    <url>      <loc>http://www. website.com/tags/12</loc>      <priority>0.70</priority>    </url>    ...   If that part of the example is unclear, forget about it. My point is this: You can use any Ruby code here to generate the sitemap with as much dynamicness (is that a word?) as you like. I chose to dynamically generate the priority value, just because that's how I get my kicks.    Note that I am using Rails 1.2, so I'm using resource helpers like tag_path to get the URLs. If you're not using these helpers, then you can generate your <loc> values using the url_for function like this:          xml.loc(""http://www.website.com""                + url_for(:controller => 'tags', :action => 'show', :id => tag))   Before you run off and create your own sitemap, you should think about where to put it. Which controller owns it? What does the  routes.rb  file look like?    Google recommends that sitemap.xml be placed at the root of your website. For example, http://www.website.com/sitemap.xml is how Google will look for it. So, your routes.rb file should setup a route to that location to tell your Rails app which controller to use to find the sitemap.rxml file. Heres what I added to the top of my routes.rb file:    map.connect 'sitemap.xml', :controller => 'products', :action => 'sitemap'   So, I created an action in my products_controller that is responsible for creating the sitemap. Done.    Let me know if you have any tips on using sitemaps with Rails apps. I didnt spend more than a day on it, so Im sure there are plenty of useful tips.                                                        Comment on this article.                                 Aug 14      2007                Rails 1.2 vs OmniFind Yahoo! Edition                           Tags:             Programming                         Ruby on Rails                              I'm back from vacation, back in the city, back in the workforce, and back with my MacBook on my lap. Time to show this blog some loving again.    I'll warm up with a quick programming article. My regular readers will leave now and not notice how rusty my writing is. People stumbling in will have low expectations. Perfect!    For some reason, I decided to install the long-named  IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition  search engine on my home web server that my web sites run on. I have a web site that could really benefit from a dedicated web crawler, since Google has been ignoring it and only indexing a few pages.    So I point it to the new website, and get this error: ""The URL does not have any pages available to crawl"". The site has almost 300 pages to crawl, so I scratched my head in confusion and dug deeper to find the root cause of the problem.    I found out that the OmniFind web crawler was requesting pages in XML format, rather than HTML. Since I had not set up the site to respond properly to XML requests, it was giving empty pages to the crawler. So of course, the crawler thought it was looking at an empty web site. From my testing, this will only happen with resources in Ruby on Rails 1.2. Older Rails apps received requests for HTML as I had expected. So, Rails 1.2 is interpreting the OmniFind crawler requests as being for XML, although I could not find anything in the request that indicated this. Could be a bug in Rails 1.2, or ambiguity in the requests.                Click to continue reading...                   This introduced me to the importance for web crawlers to identify themselves to the web sites they are crawling. The OmniFind docs strongly recommended users configure OmniFind so that it provides identification of itself, which is done in the  Crawl Web Sites > Manage Web Sites > Crawler Settings  section of the admin web app.    So, to identify the crawler, I used my e-mail address and a string I made up: ""mighty_omnifind"". Then, in my Rails app, I added the following to the application.rb controller helper:    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base    before_filter :hack_for_omnifind        def hack_for_omnifind      if @request.env[""HTTP_USER_AGENT""] == ""mighty_omnifind""        params[:format] = 'html'      end    end  end   So, if the HTTP request is coming from something that identifies itself as ""mighty_omnifind"", then I force the requested format to be HTML. Easy pickings.    I couldn't find any documentation about params[:format], but I'm getting used to the way Rails thinks, so made a guess that such a param exists. Lucky for me, it works!    I recommend IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition as an extremely easy-to-use, easy-to-install, and free search engine. The install is 3 clicks, and once you add your web site(s), it should run itself. However, since I have more than one web site running on this one box, it would be nice to be able to have a separate index for each web site. But there are ways to work around this, and it's hard to complain when the price is $0.                                                        2 comments on this article.                                 Jul 20      2007                The Ruby Is The Message                           Tags:             Programming                         Ruby on Rails                              I found an interesting presentation about Ruby aimed at Java programmers:  10 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby . It says it isn't trying to convince you that Java sucks and Ruby will make you a much happier programmer, but you might start to feel that way by the time you get to the last point.  I don't think Ruby can replace Java, but that doesn't stop me from wishing. Ruby is an object-oriented language, but differs from Java's implementation in some important ways.    Number 8 was new information to me, and I had to think about it for a while. It says that almost everything in Ruby is a message. When you call a class method, that call is a message. The method and its arguments are the message, and the class (or instance of the class) is the destination of the message. The class and the message are not joined to each other in any special way. The message could have just as easily been directed at another class object. I now think of Ruby classes this way: Classes are written to receive messages.    Is this only a distinction without a difference? I don't think so.  I'll try to illustrate with an example.                Click to continue reading...                   A while ago, I was working on a text-based MUD (multi-user dungeon, the ancestor to the modern MMORPG). I was philosophizing about where actions belonged in an object-oriented language. To unlock a door with a key in the game, how would the code be written? door.unlock(key)? key.unlock(door)? unlock(door,key)? use(door,key,unlock)? I argued against the first two examples, for reasons I can't remember. Looking at them side-by-side makes it clear that making one choice over the other may limit your design for any future features. But in practice, either one will probably work fine, so just make a choice.    Now I'm thinking about it again in terms of Ruby's messages. What if a game action was implemented as a message that could be sent to any game object? Would that solve anything? Does it give a level of abstraction that opens up a game's design? Let's see.    I made an example where we've got a ""Creature"" class, which represent any living thing, including the players, and a ""Door"" class, which is just a door. Then I implement an explosion in the room that is performed on everything in the room. Since explosions hurt, I will then apologize to everything in the room.    I'm not going to create an ""Explosion"" class, or an ""Apology"" class. I'm not even going to make it more abstract by making ""Attack"" or ""TextMessage"" classes. I'll just make one class to encapsulate them all: ActionRecorder. The ActionRecorder is like a proxy. You record the ""message"" (ie, the explosion and apology) into the ActionRecorder, and then perform the action on any other class. This creates an instance of the action that can be reused, serialized, stored, logged, or whatever you want. A game action can have multiple effects, so the ActionRecorder will store each effect as a Ruby message.    Enough blah blah blah, it's time to see some code.  Here's the ActionRecorder, the most interesting part of the code (this is taken from  the presentation ):    class ActionRecorder    def initialize      @messages = []    end        # Record all messages received, using this method:    def method_missing(method, *args, &block)      @messages << [method, args, block]    end        # Send the messages to an object    def perform_on(obj)      @messages.each do |method, args, block|        obj.send(method, *args, &block)      end    end  end  Note that method_missing is a built-in method that all Ruby classes have. It gets called automatically if you call a class for a method that it has not defined. More specifically, it catches the ""NoMethodError"" exception. Also, all Ruby classes have the send method, which receives all messages (aka, method invocations) and passes them to the methods. I assume that the send method is what throws the NoMethodError exception.    So, the ActionRecorder is taking advantage of method_missing to record all messages that an ActionRecorder instance receives. I'm not sure how you would do this in Java without getting compiler errors. It's probably possible, but won't be as elegant as this Ruby code.    Now let's create some game objects:    class Creature    # Creatures should have names:    def initialize( name )      @name = name    end        # Define some actions that can happen to Creatures:    def physical_damage(num_points)      puts ""#{@name} is hit for #{num_points} points!""    end        def fire_damage(num_points)      puts ""#{@name} is burned for #{num_points} points!""    end        def love_message(msg)      puts ""#{@name} feels the love.""    end        # Ignore actions that can't happen to Creatures:    def method_missing(method, *args, &block)      # Think carefully about using this method!    end  end    class Door    # Define some actions that can happen to Doors:    def physical_damage(num_points)      puts ""Door sustains #{num_points} points of damage.""    end        def fire_damage(num_points)      puts ""Door is burned for #{(num_points*1.5).to_i} points, and catches fire!""      self.apply_damage_over_time(1, 10) # not implemented    end        # Ignore actions that can't happen to Doors:    def method_missing(method, *args, &block)      # Think carefully about using this method!    end  end This implementation is a bit sloppy. I would probably implement a ""DamageEvents"" module and apply it to those two classes, from which they would get the physical_damage and fire_damage methods, but whatever. Also, the method_missing method should not just ignore all illegal methods. There are probably cases where you will want to raise an exception if an object receives an illegal method message. But let's just go with it for the example.    Now, how do you perform actions on the objects? Let's have some action!    # ------- Test the classes ----------------------    puts ""Start...""    # Populate the game with stuff:  human = Creature.new(""Neil"")  door = Door.new    # Put stuff in a room:  things_in_room = [human, door]    # An explosion happens in the room!  explosion = ActionRecorder.new  explosion.physical_damage 2  explosion.fire_damage 10    # See what happens to everything in the room:  things_in_room.each do |thing|    explosion.perform_on thing  end    # Apologize for the explosion  apology = ActionRecorder.new  apology.love_message ""Sorry!""    things_in_room.each do |thing|    apology.perform_on thing  end    puts ""Done"" And here's the output:    Start...  Neil is hit for 2 points!  Neil is burned for 10 points!  Door sustains 2 points of damage.  Door is burned for 15 points, and catches fire!  Neil feels the love.  Done  I definitely like this way of coding this example! The code is written almost in english. Look at the definition of the explosion. It doesn't get much more readable than that! Also, ""explosion.perform_on thing"" is very easy to read. This is the kind of code that makes a programmer smile.    I can see more ways that the ActionRecorder will facilitate new features.  Here are some thoughts about how to extend this type of proxy class:    - ActionRecorder can log all messages it receives, or send the messages to a Logger class that can choose which methods to log and which to ignore, in exactly the same way that we implemented the Creature and Door classes.  - A similar recorder can be used to execute scripted effects. A ScriptRecorder class. So, if your game's content developers write scripts in Lua or some home-grown script language, you can read them in and record them as ScriptRecorder objects that can be applied to game objects. You can write a Lua script that defines the explosion, read it in to a ScriptRecorder, and you've got the implementation of that script done. (Actually, I would use Ruby as the scripting language, so nevermind...)  - In-game chat messages that pass through a recorder (ChatRecorder?) could be parsed, logged, or blocked. Messages may need to go to some players, but not others. Whispers, guild chat, party chat, in-game languages, etc.  - Convert in-game chat messages to telnet protocol strings before sending them over the network.    What do you think? How would you take advantage of this?                                                        1 comments on this article.                                 Jul 05      2007                Using Indexes to Improve Rails Performance                           Tags:             Programming                         Ruby on Rails                               Heres another article about performance in Ruby on Rails apps. This one has information that is brutally obvious to anyone with database experience, but if youre more of a web developer than a database admin, then this article may be insightful for you. Check out my first article,  Using :select in Rails for Better Performance , for other tips.    I have looked at a lot of other peoples Rails code as I was learning, including their  database migrations , and have rarely seen indexes being created with the tables. For those who arent using database migrations, take the time to learn about them and youll never go back to writing CREATE TABLE statements yourself again! Seriously, migrations might be my favorite feature in Rails!    Anyway, a table without an index is not much of a table at all. Querying a table without an index is a performance problem waiting to happen.      Whats An Index?     In a database, you have a few different kinds of objects. Youve got tables, which are just big containers in which you put your data. The data is not sorted, so if you want to find something in a table, you need to look through everything until you find what you want.                Click to continue reading...                 You also have indexes. An index is a sorted list of rows in a table. It contains a small subset of the tables data, just enough to sort the data and point to the real data rows in the real table. So, when you want to find something in a table, you look at a suitable index, not the table. The index will point to the rows of the table that match what you are looking for.      A Cheeky Example     Heres the best example: a phone book. The phone book contains a lot of data, but we know how to find phone numbers very quickly because there is an index on the phone numbers. The phone book is indexed by last name, first name, and address, in that order. So when you want to find Cheeky McMonkeys phone number, you flip right to the part of the phone book that has last names starting with M, then find Mc, and so on.    Now imagine if the phone book did not have an index. How would you find Cheeky McMonkeys phone number? You would just start on the first page and look at all the names until you found Cheeky, one row at a time, one page at a time. A few days later, you might have found his phone number. Her phone number? Cheeky? No, its a him.  His  phone number. I should call him more often.      Cheeky in Rails     Lets do the Rails database migration for a phone book with its index.  Well create it with this command:    ruby script/generate migration PhoneBook   And heres what the database migration could look like:    class PhoneBook < ActiveRecord::Migration    def self.up      # Create the table:      create_table :phone_book do |t|        t.column :phone_number, :string, :null => false        t.column :last_name, :string, :null => false        t.column :first_name, :string, :null => false        t.column :address, :string, :null => false      end        # Create an index on the table:      add_index :phone_book, [:last_name, :first_name, :address]    end      def self.down      # Drop the index:      remove_index :phone_book, [:last_name, :first_name, :address]        # Drop the table:      drop_table :phone_book    end  end   Note that the order of the column names in the add_index statement is very important! This index will be used to find rows in the phone_book table when you do PhoneBook.find and your :conditions option specifies the last_name option (and possibly more). The last_name column is the most important column in the index. If a query (find) does not include last_name in the :conditions, then the index will not be used! The entire table will be searched instead.    The index is sorted, so the database can look at it just like we look at a phone book. It flips to the correct pages of the index just like we do when we flip open a phone book. When it finds the terms that match your :conditions, it can then look up the data (the phone_number) in the phone_book table.    Here are some find calls that will use the index and perform very quickly no matter how many millions of rows are in the phone_book table:    PhoneBook.find(:all,      :conditions => [last_name = ? AND first_name = ? AND address = ?,      McMonkey, Cheeky, 421 Monkey Banana Crescent])    PhoneBook.find(:all,      :conditions => [last_name = ? AND first_name = ?,      McMonkey, Cheeky])    PhoneBook.find(:all,      :conditions => [last_name = ?, McMonkey])    PhoneBook.find(:all,      :conditions => [last_name = ? AND address = ?,      McMonkey, 421 Monkey Banana Crescent])   Even if your :conditions dont include the entire column list of the index, the database can still use the index. If you limit your search with last_name, then the index can be used.    Here are queries that cannot use the index, and will perform very poorly:    PhoneBook.find(:all,      :conditions => [first_name = ? AND address = ?,      Cheeky, 421 Monkey Banana Crescent])    PhoneBook.find(:all,      :conditions => [address = ?, 421 Monkey Banana Crescent])    PhoneBook.find(:all,      :conditions => [phone_number = ?, 416-555-0880])   Going back to our phone book analogy, its easy to understand why these queries would perform horribly. If you knew a phone number but wanted to know who it belonged to, the phone book wont be able to help you very well unless you have a lot of time on your hands.      One Index Or Two?     So, what if you wanted to do reverse look-ups like that? If your web site needs to find peoples names based on their phone numbers, then you can just create another index on the table:        add_index :phone_book, :phone_number   Done. You can create as many indexes as you need on a table. Its like having multiple copies of the same phone book, but each of them sorted differently.    Note however that there is no advantage in having indexes with redundant column lists. For example, these indexes are redundant:        add_index :phone_book, [:last_name, :first_name, :address]      add_index :phone_book, [:last_name, :first_name]      add_index :phone_book, :last_name   Only the first index is needed. The last two are subsets of the first index, so they serve no purpose. The database might give you an error or warning if you try to create them, Im not sure. It depends on which database product you are using.      What Kind of Good Performance Does This Give Me?     By this point, you should imagine if you had multiple copies of the same phone book in your house. Its great to have phone numbers indexed in different ways, who wouldn't enjoy that? But they sure take up a lot of space on the coffee table. And when phone numbers get added, changed, and removed, youve got to replace all your phone books!    This is true in a database too. Having indexes improves query performance, but can hurt other kinds of database operations: inserts, updates, and deletes. If your app changes the data in your database frequently, then you need to consider the performance penalties of indexes on those operations. When table data changes, all the indexes need to be updated. Youll have to find a balance between query performance and transaction performance. Some testing and measurements may be needed. Once you create a fifth or sixth index on a table, you should really stop and think about it. What kinds of :conditions are you using in your queries? Can they be changed to use existing indexes?    If your database is almost entirely used for queries, not transactions, then have no fear. Indexes are what you want. In practice, indexes will have negligible impact on create, read, and delete operation performance. But I would be remiss if I didn't mention this point.      How Do I Know Which Indexes I Need?     To figure out which indexes you should create, I suggest you look at all the  find  calls that you make in your Rails code. The :conditions you use tell you which indexes you need. Heres an example of two separate queries:    @article_list = Article.find(:all,      :conditions => [created_at < ? AND comments_count > ?, Time.now, 0])    @article = Article.find(:first, :conditions => [created_at < ?, Time.now])   Both of those queries will benefit from an index on created_at (first) and comments_count (second):    add_index :articles, [:created_at, :comments_count]   Its that easy! This is why developers and database admins need to talk to each other. Database admins won't know which indexes to create if they don't know what queries the developers are using.      Final Cheeky Thoughts     If your Rails app is suffering from performance problems, the solution might be as easy as adding a missing index. With the right index, any query should run in a fraction of a second. If you measure your database performance in seconds rather than milliseconds, then it might be time to look at all your queries and indexes to see if youre missing something.    Also, the on-disk size of an index depends on the columns of that index. So, if youve got a string column that has a length measured in hundreds or thousands, than you should probably not include it in an index. Your VARCHAR(32000) columns are not the best candidates for indexes. Use them only if you have a very good reason.    Well, that was a long one.

Rails makes it very easy to use databases with your web sites, which is a great thing, but with a little problem. As I search for Rails info on the web, I find that a lot of writers dont seem to have the database background to understand performance issues. They let Rails deal with the database and think nothing more about it. I think its very important that if you use databases in your code, in whichever language and framework you choose, you should take time to learn about them in depth!    DISTINCT in Rails     I was looking into a way to list all the values that appear in one column of a table. I didnt want all the rows, just the unique values that appear in a column. In SQL, this is done with the DISTINCT keyword. For example, SELECT DISTINCT year FROM blog_posts would list all the years that are in the year column of the blog_posts table.                Click to continue reading...                 So, how do you do a SELECT DISTINCT query with Rails? Heres one solution that I found (I wont post a link to the site since the author ought to be embarrassed!):    @distinctlist = Item.find(:all).map{ |i| i.fieldname }.uniq   That would certainly work. But what if your item table has thousands of rows? Millions of rows? This single line of code could take a very, very long time to complete! I mean, minutes or hours! The programmer might look at that and think it is elegant and compact, but wont think so when it brings the server to its knees.    How does that statement work? First, it executes this:    Item.find(:all)   That will fetch all columns in all rows from the items table, without exception, and load it into memory. No query can perform more slowly than that, or use more memory. Once that horrendous step is done, all the data is passed to the map function. Once that step is done, all that data is then passed to the uniq function. If you do this on a table that will always have a few rows, then youre fine. Otherwise, your website visitors will leave your site before the query even completes.    The better solution is to use the :select parameter of the ActiveRecord find method. Heres an example:    Item.find( :all, :select => 'DISTINCT fieldname' )   The :select parameter is overriding part of Rails query to the database. Rather than letting Rails build the entire query, we are telling it which columns to select and how to query them. Rails will still generate most of the query, but use our select list instead.    The advantage of this method is that we pass all the work to the database. Databases are designed to be the very best at analyzing and retrieving data very quickly. Thats what they do! The database has indexes (which you should have created in the database migration) to perform the DISTINCT processing for us in sub-second time. This is far better than telling the database to give us all the data from the table so that we can deal with it using Ruby ourselves. Make the database work for you. Dont reproduce database functionality in your Ruby code.    Note that my example will only give you one column from the table: fieldname. In the Item objects that get instantiated, you wont be able to access the other attributes of the model. But that makes sense, given our query. We want to know the unique values of fieldname, so we dont need the other columns of the table. That wouldn't make sense. Which brings us to another benefit: minimal data is sent from the database to your Rails app, lowering memory usage.    Improving Performance with :select     What else can you do with the :select option? You can tailor your queries to give you only the information you need, which can improve performance greatly in some situations. For example, say I have a table of text articles (like I do with this blog). It could have these columns:    created_at (datetime)  title (string)  bodytext (string, containing the entire text of an article)  comments_count (integer)    The bodytext column will have a huge amount of data compared to the other three columns. After years of posting articles on my blog, there can be hundreds of rows in this table. If I want to fetch many of the rows in this table, but dont need to use the bodytext column, then I can improve performance and memory usage by excluding bodytext from the query, like this:    @articles = Article.find( :all, :select => created_at, title, comments_count )   This will use a tiny amount of memory and be very fast compared to the output of this query:    @articles = Article.find( :all )   Using :select means that you need to be mindful of how the query result is used. If a part of my code tries to do article.bodytext on an element, it will find that bodytext does not exist. But Im not suggesting that you use :select for general use queries. Youll use it for specific situations where you know what you need and when it will be used.    I hope this is useful to someone. In general, I think carefully whenever I use find(:all) in Rails. Do my :conditions limit the query enough? Is there an index for the :conditions? Can I use :limit? Is there something in the :select option that I should be using to improve performance and memory usage? Those are the kind of things that should pop into your mind too whenever you use ActiveRecords find method.                                                        10 comments on this article.

Everyone is entitled to change and redistribute GNU software; you need not pay attention to this file to get permission.  But if you want to maintain a version for widespread distribution, we suggest you follow these guidelines; if you would like to be a GNU maintainer, then it is essential to follow these guidelines.     In addition to this document, please read and follow the GNU Coding Standards (*note Contents: (standards)Top.).     Please send corrections or suggestions for this document to  .  If you make a suggestion, please include a suggested new wording for it, to help us consider the suggestion efficiently.  We prefer a context diff to the `maintain.texi' file, but if you don't have that file, you can make a context diff for some other version of this document, or propose it in any way that makes it clear.     If you have general questions or encounter a situation where it isn't clear what to do, you can ask  , which is a list of a few other GNU contributor who have offered to answer questions for new maintainers.     This document uses the gender-neutral third-person pronouns ""person"", ""per"", ""pers"" and ""perself"" which were promoted, and perhaps invented, by Marge Piercy in `Woman on the Edge of Time'.  They are used just like ""she"", ""her"", ""hers"" and ""herself"", except that they apply equally to males and females.  For example, ""Person placed per new program under the GNU GPL, to let the public benefit from per work, and to enable per to feel person has done the right thing.""     The directory `/gd/gnuorg' is found on the GNU file server, currently `fencepost.gnu.org'; if you are the maintainer of a GNU package, you should have an account there.  See `http://www.gnu.org/software/README.accounts.html' if you don't have one.  (You can also ask for accounts for people who help you a large amount in working on the package.)     This release of the GNU Maintenance Instructions was last updated January 1, 2009.  2 Stepping Down ***************  With good fortune, you will continue maintaining your package for many decades.  But sometimes for various reasons maintainers decide to step down.     If you're the official maintainer of a GNU package and you decide to step down, please inform the GNU Project ( ).  We need to know that the package no longer has a maintainer, so we can look for and appoint a new maintainer.     If you have an idea for who should take over, please tell   your suggestion.  The appointment of a new maintainer needs the GNU Project's confirmation, but your judgment that a person is capable of doing the job will carry a lot of weight.     As your final act as maintainer, it would be helpful to set up the package under `savannah.gnu.org' (*note Old Versions::).  This will make it much easier for the new maintainer to pick up where you left off and will ensure that the source tree is not misplaced if it takes us a while to find a new maintainer.  3 Recruiting Developers ***********************  Unless your package is a fairly small, you probably won't do all the work on it yourself.  Most maintainers recruit other developers to help.     Sometimes people will offer to help.  Some of them will be capable, while others will not.  It's up to you to determine who provides useful help, and encourage those people to participate more.     Some of the people who offer to help will support the GNU Project, while others may be interested for other reasons.  Some will support the goals of the Free Software Movement, but some may not.  They are all welcome to help with the work--we don't ask people's views or motivations before they contribute to GNU packages.     As a consequence, you cannot expect all contributors to support the GNU Project, or to have a concern for its policies and standards.  So part of your job as maintainer is to exercise your authority on these points when they arise.  No matter how much of the work other people do, you are in charge of what goes in the release.  When a crucial point arises, you should calmly state your decision and stick to it.     Sometimes a package has several co-maintainers who share the role of maintainer.  Unlike developers who help, co-maintainers have actually been appointed jointly as the maintainers of the package, and they carry out the maintainer's functions together.  If you would like to propose some of your developers as co-maintainers, please contact  .     We're happy to acknowledge all major contributors to GNU packages on the `http://www.gnu.org/people/people.html' web page.  Please send an entry for yourself to  , and feel free to suggest it to other significant developers on your package.  4 Legal Matters ***************  This chapter describes procedures you should follow for legal reasons as you maintain the program, to avoid legal difficulties.  4.1 Copyright Papers ====================  If you maintain an FSF-copyrighted package certain legal procedures are required when incorporating legally significant changes written by other people.  This ensures that the FSF has the legal right to distribute the package, and the standing to defend its GPL-covered status in court if necessary.     *Before* incorporating significant changes, make sure that the person who wrote the changes has signed copyright papers and that the Free Software Foundation has received and signed them.  We may also need an employer's disclaimer from the person's employer.     To check whether papers have been received, look in `/gd/gnuorg/copyright.list'.  If you can't look there directly,   can check for you.  Our clerk can also check for papers that are waiting to be entered and inform you when expected papers arrive.     The directory `/gd/gnuorg' is found on the GNU machines, currently `fencepost.gnu.org'; if you are the maintainer of a GNU package, you should have an account on them.  Contact   if you don't have one.  (You can also ask for accounts for people who help you a large amount in working on the package.)     In order for the contributor to know person should sign papers, you need to ask per for the necessary papers.  If you don't know per well, and you don't know that person is used to our ways of handling copyright papers, then it might be a good idea to raise the subject with a message like this:       Would you be willing to assign the copyright to the Free Software      Foundation, so that we could install it in PROGRAM?  or       Would you be willing to sign a copyright disclaimer to put this      change in the public domain, so that we can install it in PROGRAM?     If the contributor wants more information, you can send per `/gd/gnuorg/conditions.text', which explains per options (assign vs. disclaim) and their consequences.     Once the conversation is under way and the contributor is ready for more details, you should send one of the templates that are found in the directory `/gd/gnuorg/Copyright/'; they are also available from the `doc/Copyright/' directory of the `gnulib' project at `http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib'.  This section explains which templates you should use in which circumstances.  *Please don't use any of the templates except for those listed here, and please don't change the wording.*     Once the conversation is under way, you can send the contributor the precise wording and instructions by email.  Before you do this, make sure to get the current version of the template you will use!  We change these templates occasionally--don't keep using an old version.     For large changes, ask the contributor for an assignment.  Send per a copy of the file `request-assign.changes'.  (Like all the `request-' files, it is in `/gd/gnuorg/Copyright' and in `gnulib'.)     For medium to small changes, request a personal disclaimer by sending per the file `request-disclaim.changes'.     If the contributor is likely to keep making changes, person might want to sign an assignment for all per future changes to the program. So it is useful to offer per that alternative.  If person wants to do it that way, send per the `request-assign.future'.     When you send a `request-' file, you don't need to fill in anything before sending it.  Just send the file verbatim to the contributor.  The file gives per instructions for how to ask the FSF to mail per the papers to sign.  The `request-' file also raises the issue of getting an employer's disclaimer from the contributor's employer.     When the contributor emails the form to the FSF, the FSF sends per papers to sign.  If person signs them right away, the whole process takes about two weeks-mostly waiting for letters to go back and forth.     For less common cases, we have template files you should send to the contributor.  Be sure to fill in the name of the person and the name of the program in these templates, where it says `NAME OF PERSON' and `NAME OF PROGRAM', before sending; otherwise person might sign without noticing them, and the papers would be useless.  Note that in some templates there is more than one place to put the name of the program or the name of the person; be sure to change all of them.  All the templates raise the issue of an employer's disclaimer as well.     You do not need to ask for separate papers for a manual that is distributed only in the software package it describes.  But if we sometimes distribute the manual separately (for instance, if we publish it as a book), then we need separate legal papers for changes in the manual.  For smaller changes, use `disclaim.changes.manual'; for larger ones, use `assign.changes.manual'.  To cover both past and future changes to a manual, you can use `assign.future.manual'.  For a translation of a manual, use `assign.translation.manual'.     For translations of program strings (as used by GNU Gettext, for example; *note Internationalization: (standards)Internationalization.), use `disclaim.translation'.  If you make use of the Translation Project (`http://translationproject.org') facilities, please check with the TP coordinators that they have sent the contributor the papers; if they haven't, then you should send the papers.  In any case, you should wait for the confirmation from the FSF that the signed papers have been received and accepted before integrating the new contributor's material, as usual.     If a contributor is reluctant to sign an assignment for a large change, and is willing to sign a disclaimer instead, that is acceptable, so you should offer this alternative if it helps you reach agreement.  We prefer an assignment for a larger change, so that we can enforce the GNU GPL for the new text, but a disclaimer is enough to let us use the text.     If you maintain a collection of programs, occasionally someone will contribute an entire separate program or manual that should be added to the collection.  Then you can use the files `request-assign.program', `disclaim.program', `assign.manual', and `disclaim.manual'.  We very much prefer an assignment for a new separate program or manual, unless it is quite small, but a disclaimer is acceptable if the contributor insists on handling the matter that way.     If a contributor wants the FSF to publish only a pseudonym, that is ok.  The contributor should say this, and state the desired pseudonym, when answering the `request-' form.  The actual legal papers will use the real name, but the FSF will publish only the pseudonym.  When using one of the other forms, fill in the real name but ask the contributor to discuss the use of a pseudonym with   before sending back the signed form.     *Although there are other templates besides the ones listed here, they are for special circumstances; please do not use them without getting advice from  .*     If you are not sure what to do, then please ask   for advice; if the contributor asks you questions about the meaning and consequences of the legal papers, and you don't know the answers, you can forward them to   and we will answer.     *Please do not try changing the wording of a template yourself.  If you think a change is needed, please talk with  , and we will work with a lawyer to decide what to do.*  4.2 Legally Significant Changes ===============================  If a person contributes more than around 15 lines of code and/or text that is legally significant for copyright purposes, we need copyright papers for that contribution, as described above.     A change of just a few lines (less than 15 or so) is not legally significant for copyright.  A regular series of repeated changes, such as renaming a symbol, is not legally significant even if the symbol has to be renamed in many places.  Keep in mind, however, that a series of minor changes by the same person can add up to a significant contribution.  What counts is the total contribution of the person; it is irrelevant which parts of it were contributed when.     Copyright does not cover ideas.  If someone contributes ideas but no text, these ideas may be morally significant as contributions, and worth giving credit for, but they are not significant for copyright purposes.  Likewise, bug reports do not count for copyright purposes.     When giving credit to people whose contributions are not legally significant for copyright purposes, be careful to make that fact clear. The credit should clearly say they did not contribute significant code or text.     When people's contributions are not legally significant because they did not write code, do this by stating clearly what their contribution was.  For instance, you could write this:       /*       * Ideas by:       *   Richard Mlynarik   (1997)       *   Masatake Yamato   (1999)       */  `Ideas by:' makes it clear that Mlynarik and Yamato here contributed only ideas, not code.  Without the `Ideas by:' note, several years from now we would find it hard to be sure whether they had contributed code, and we might have to track them down and ask them.     When you record a small patch in a change log file, first search for previous changes by the same person, and see if per past contributions, plus the new one, add up to something legally significant.  If so, you should get copyright papers for all per changes before you install the new change.     If that is not so, you can install the small patch.  Write `(tiny change)' after the patch author's name, like this:       2002-11-04  Robert Fenk     (tiny change)  4.3 Recording Contributors ==========================  *Keep correct records of which portions were written by whom.* This is very important.  These records should say which files or parts of files were written by each person, and which files or parts of files were revised by each person.  This should include installation scripts as well as manuals and documentation files--everything.     These records don't need to be as detailed as a change log.  They don't need to distinguish work done at different times, only different people.  They don't need describe changes in more detail than which files or parts of a file were changed.  And they don't need to say anything about the function or purpose of a file or change-the Register of Copyrights doesn't care what the text does, just who wrote or contributed to which parts.     The list should also mention if certain files distributed in the same package are really a separate program.     Only the contributions that are legally significant for copyright purposes (*note Legally Significant::) need to be listed.  Small contributions, bug reports, ideas, etc., can be omitted.     For example, this would describe an early version of GAS:       Dean Elsner   first version of all files except gdb-lines.c and m68k.c.      Jay Fenlason  entire files gdb-lines.c and m68k.c, most of app.c,                    plus extensive changes in messages.c, input-file.c, write.c                    and revisions elsewhere.       Note: GAS is distributed with the files obstack.c and obstack.h, but      they are considered a separate package, not part of GAS proper.     Please keep these records in a file named `AUTHORS' in the source directory for the program itself.     You can use the change log as the basis for these records, if you wish.  Just make sure to record the correct author for each change (the person who wrote the change, _not_ the person who installed it), and add `(tiny change)' for those changes that are too trivial to matter for copyright purposes.  Later on you can update the `AUTHORS' file from the change log.  This can even be done automatically, if you are careful about the formatting of the change log entries.  4.4 Copying from Other Packages ===============================  When you copy legally significant code from another free software package with a GPL-compatible license, you should look in the package's records to find out the authors of the part you are copying, and list them as the contributors of the code that you copied.  If all you did was copy it, not write it, then for copyright purposes you are _not_ one of the contributors of _this_ code.     Especially when code has been released into the public domain, authors sometimes fail to write a license statement in each file.  In this case, please first be sure that all the authors of the code have disclaimed copyright interest.  Then, when copying the new files into your project, add a brief note at the beginning of the files recording the authors, the public domain status, and anything else relevant.     On the other hand, when merging some public domain code into an existing file covered by the GPL (or LGPL or other free software license), there is no reason to indicate the pieces which are public domain.  The notice saying that the whole file is under the GPL (or other license) is legally sufficient.     Using code that is released under a GPL-compatible free license, rather than being in the public domain, may require preserving copyright notices or other steps.  Of course, you should do what is needed.     If you are maintaining an FSF-copyrighted package, please verify we have papers for the code you are copying, _before_ copying it.  If you are copying from another FSF-copyrighted package, then we presumably have papers for that package's own code, but you must check whether the code you are copying is part of an external library; if that is the case, we don't have papers for it, so you should not copy it.  It can't hurt in any case to double-check with the developer of that package.     When you are copying code for which we do not already have papers, you need to get papers for it.  It may be difficult to get the papers if the code was not written as a contribution to your package, but that doesn't mean it is ok to do without them.  If you cannot get papers for the code, you can only use it as an external library (*note External Libraries::).  4.5 Copyright Notices =====================  You should maintain a proper copyright notice and a license notice in each nontrivial file in the package.  (Any file more than ten lines long is nontrivial for this purpose.)  This includes header files and interface definitions for building or running the program, documentation files, and any supporting files.  If a file has been explicitly placed in the public domain, then instead of a copyright notice, it should have a notice saying explicitly that it is in the public domain.     Even image files and sound files should contain copyright notices and license notices, if they can.  Some formats do not have room for textual annotations; for these files, state the copyright and copying permissions in a README file in the same directory.     Change log files should have a copyright notice and license notice at the end, since new material is added at the beginning but the end remains the end.     When a file is automatically generated from some other file in the distribution, it is useful for the automatic procedure to copy the copyright notice and permission notice of the file it is generated from, if possible.  Alternatively, put a notice at the beginning saying which file it is generated from.     A copyright notice looks like this:       Copyright (C) YEAR1, YEAR2, YEAR3  COPYRIGHT-HOLDER     The COPYRIGHT-HOLDER may be the Free Software Foundation, Inc., or someone else; you should know who is the copyright holder for your package.     Replace the `(C)' with a C-in-a-circle symbol if it is available. For example, use `@copyright{}' in a Texinfo file.  However, stick with parenthesized `C' unless you know that C-in-a-circle will work.  For example, a program's standard `--version' message should use parenthesized `C' by default, though message translations may use C-in-a-circle in locales where that symbol is known to work.     To update the list of year numbers, add each year in which you have made nontrivial changes to the package.  (Here we assume you're using a publicly accessible revision control server, so that every revision installed is also immediately and automatically published.)  When you add the new year, it is not required to keep track of which files have seen significant changes in the new year and which have not.  It is recommended and simpler to add the new year to all files in the package, and be done with it for the rest of the year.     Don't delete old year numbers, though; they are significant since they indicate when older versions might theoretically go into the public domain, if the movie companies don't continue buying laws to further extend copyright.  If you copy a file into the package from some other program, keep the copyright years that come with the file.     Do not abbreviate the year list using a range; for instance, do not write `1996--1998'; instead, write `1996, 1997, 1998'.     For files which are regularly copied from another project (such as `gnulib'), leave the copyright notice as it is in the original.     The copyright statement may be split across multiple lines, both in source files and in any generated output.  This often happens for files with a long history, having many different years of publication.     For an FSF-copyrighted package, if you have followed the procedures to obtain legal papers, each file should have just one copyright holder: the Free Software Foundation, Inc.  You should edit the file's copyright notice to list that name and only that name.     But if contributors are not all assigning their copyrights to a single copyright holder, it can easily happen that one file has several copyright holders.  Each contributor of nontrivial text is a copyright holder.     In that case, you should always include a copyright notice in the name of main copyright holder of the file.  You can also include copyright notices for other copyright holders as well, and this is a good idea for those who have contributed a large amount and for those who specifically ask for notices in their names.  (Sometimes the license on code that you copy in may require preserving certain copyright notices.)  But you don't have to include a notice for everyone who contributed to the file (which would be rather inconvenient).     Sometimes a program has an overall copyright notice that refers to the whole program.  It might be in the `README' file, or it might be displayed when the program starts up.  This copyright notice should mention the year of completion of the most recent major version; it can mention years of completion of previous major versions, but that is optional.  4.6 License Notices ===================  Every nontrivial file needs a license notice as well as the copyright notice.  (Without a license notice giving permission to copy and change the file, the file is non-free.)     The package itself should contain a full copy of GPL in plain text (conventionally in a file named `COPYING') and the GNU Free Documentation License (included within your documentation, so there is no need for a separate plain text version).  If the package contains any files distributed under the Lesser GPL, it should contain a full copy of its plain text version also (conventionally in a file named `COPYING.LESSER').     If you have questions about license issues for your GNU package, please write  .  4.6.1 Canonical License Sources -------------------------------  You can get the official versions of these files from several places. You can use whichever is the most convenient for you.     * `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.     * The `gnulib' project on `savannah.gnu.org', which you can access      via anonymous Git or CVS.  See      `http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib'.      The official Texinfo sources for the licenses are also available in those same places, so you can include them in your documentation.  A GFDL-covered manual should include the GFDL in this way.  *Note GNU Sample Texts: (texinfo)GNU Sample Texts, for a full example in a Texinfo manual.  4.6.2 License Notices for Code ------------------------------  Typically the license notice for program files (including build scripts, configure files and makefiles) should cite the GPL, like this:       This file is part of GNU PROGRAM.       GNU PROGRAM is free software: you can redistribute it and/or      modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as      published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the      License, or (at your option) any later version.       GNU PROGRAM is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but      WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU      General Public License for more details.       You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License      along with this program.  If not, see      `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.     But in a small program which is just a few files, you can use this instead:       This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or      modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as      published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the      License, or (at your option) any later version.

See the GNU      General Public License for more details.       You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License      along with this program.  If not, see      `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.  4.6.3 License Notices for Documentation ---------------------------------------  Documentation files should have license notices also.  Manuals should use the GNU Free Documentation License.  Following is an example of the license notice to use after the copyright line(s) using all the features of the GFDL.       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or      any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with the      Invariant Sections being ``GNU General Public License'', with the      Front-Cover Texts being ``A GNU Manual'', and with the Back-Cover Texts      as in (a) below.  A copy of the license is included in the section      entitled ``GNU Free Documentation License''.       (a) The FSF's Back-Cover Text is: ``You have the freedom to      copy and modify this GNU manual.  Buying copies from the FSF      supports it in developing GNU and promoting software freedom.''     If the FSF does not publish this manual on paper, then omit the last sentence in (a) that talks about copies from GNU Press.  If the FSF is not the copyright holder, then replace `FSF' with the appropriate name.     Please adjust the list of invariant sections as appropriate for your manual.  If there are none, then say ""with no Invariant Sections"".  If your manual is not published by the FSF, and under 400 pages, you can omit both cover texts.     *Note GNU Sample Texts: (texinfo)GNU Sample Texts, for a full example in a Texinfo manual, and see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-howto.html' for more advice about how to use the GNU FDL.     If the manual is over 400 pages, or if the FSF thinks it might be a good choice for publishing on paper, then please include the GNU GPL, as in the notice above.  Please also include our standard invariant section which explains the importance of free documentation.  Write to   to get a copy of this section.     When you distribute several manuals together in one software package, their on-line forms can share a single copy of the GFDL (see section 6).  However, the printed (`.dvi', `.pdf', ...) forms should each contain a copy of the GFDL, unless they are set up to be printed and published only together.  Therefore, it is usually simplest to include the GFDL in each manual.  4.6.4 License Notices for Other Files -------------------------------------  Small supporting files, short manuals (under 300 lines long) and rough documentation (README files, INSTALL files, etc) can use a simple all-permissive license like this one:       Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,      are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright      notice and this notice are preserved.     If your package distributes Autoconf macros that are intended to be used (hence distributed) by third-party packages under possibly incompatible licenses, you may also use the above all-permissive license for these macros.  4.7 External Libraries ======================  When maintaining an FSF-copyrighted GNU package, you may occasionally want to use a general-purpose free software module which offers a useful functionality, as a ""library"" facility (though the module is not always packaged technically as a library).     In a case like this, it would be unreasonable to ask the author of that module to assign the copyright to the FSF.  After all, person did not write it specifically as a contribution to your package, so it would be impertinent to ask per, out of the blue, ""Please give the FSF your copyright.""     So the thing to do in this case is to make your program use the module, but not consider it a part of your program.  There are two reasonable methods of doing this:    1. Assume the module is already installed on the system, and use it      when linking your program.  This is only reasonable if the module      really has the form of a library.    2. Include the module in your package, putting the source in a      separate subdirectory whose `README' file says, ""This is not part      of the GNU FOO program, but is used with GNU FOO.""  Then set up      your makefiles to build this module and link it into the      executable.       For this method, it is not necessary to treat the module as a      library and make a `.a' file from it.  You can link with the `.o'      files directly in the usual manner.     Both of these methods create an irregularity, and our lawyers have told us to minimize the amount of such irregularity.  So consider using these methods only for general-purpose modules that were written for other programs and released separately for general use.  For anything that was written as a contribution to your package, please get papers signed.  5 Cleaning Up Changes *********************  Don't feel obligated to include every change that someone asks you to include.  You must judge which changes are improvements--partly based on what you think the users will like, and partly based on your own judgment of what is better.  If you think a change is not good, you should reject it.     If someone sends you changes which are useful, but written in an ugly way or hard to understand and maintain in the future, don't hesitate to ask per to clean up their changes before you merge them.  Since the amount of work we can do is limited, the more we convince others to help us work efficiently, the faster GNU will advance.     If the contributor will not or can not make the changes clean enough, then it is legitimate to say ""I can't install this in its present form; I can only do so if you clean it up.""  Invite per to distribute per changes another way, or to find other people to make them clean enough for you to install and maintain.     The only reason to do these cleanups yourself is if (1) it is easy, less work than telling the author what to clean up, or (2) the change is an important one, important enough to be worth the work of cleaning it up.     The GNU Coding Standards are a good thing to send people when you ask them to clean up changes (*note Contents: (standards)Top.).  The Emacs Lisp manual contains an appendix that gives coding standards for Emacs Lisp programs; it is good to urge Lisp authors to read it (*note Tips and Conventions: (elisp)Tips.).  6 Platforms to Support **********************  Most GNU packages run on a wide range of platforms.  These platforms are not equally important.     The most important platforms for a GNU package to support are GNU and GNU/Linux.  Developing the GNU operating system is the whole point of the GNU Project; a GNU package exists to make the whole GNU system more powerful.  So please keep that goal in mind and let it shape your work. For instance, every new feature you add should work on GNU, and GNU/Linux if possible too.  If a new feature only runs on GNU and GNU/Linux, it could still be acceptable.  However, a feature that runs only on other systems and not on GNU or GNU/Linux makes no sense in a GNU package.     You will naturally want to keep the program running on all the platforms it supports.  But you personally will not have access to most of these platforms-so how should you do it?     Don't worry about trying to get access to all of these platforms. Even if you did have access to all the platforms, it would be inefficient for you to test the program on each platform yourself. Instead, you should test the program on a few platforms, including GNU or GNU/Linux, and let the users test it on the other platforms.  You can do this through a pretest phase before the real release; when there is no reason to expect problems, in a package that is mostly portable, you can just make a release and let the users tell you if anything unportable was introduced.     It is important to test the program personally on GNU or GNU/Linux, because these are the most important platforms for a GNU package.  If you don't have access to one of these platforms, please ask   to help you out.     Supporting other platforms is optional--we do it when that seems like a good idea, but we don't consider it obligatory.  If the users don't take care of a certain platform, you may have to desupport it unless and until users come forward to help.  Conversely, if a user offers changes to support an additional platform, you will probably want to install them, but you don't have to.  If you feel the changes are complex and ugly, if you think that they will increase the burden of future maintenance, you can and should reject them.  This includes both free or mainly-free platforms such as OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD, and non-free platforms such as Windows.  7 Dealing With Mail *******************  Once a program is in use, you will get bug reports for it.  Most GNU programs have their own special lists for sending bug reports.  The advertised bug-reporting email address should always be `bug-PROGRAM@gnu.org', to help show users that the program is a GNU package, but it is ok to set up that list to forward to another site for further forwarding.  The package distribution should state the name of the bug-reporting list in a prominent place, and ask users to help us by reporting bugs there.     We also have a catch-all list,  , which is used for all GNU programs that don't have their own specific lists.  But nowadays we want to give each program its own bug-reporting list and move away from using  .     If you wish, you can also have mailing lists such as `info-PROGRAM' for announcements (*note Announcements::), `help-PROGRAM' for general help and discussion (see below), or any others you find useful.     By far the easiest way to create mailing lists is through `savannah.gnu.org'.  Once you register your program, you can do this yourself through the `Mailing Lists' menu, without needing intervention by anyone else.  Furthermore, lists created through Savannah will have a reasonable default configuration for antispam purposes (see below).     If you are the maintainer of a GNU package, you should have an account on the GNU servers; contact `http://www.gnu.org/software/README.accounts.html' if you don't have one.  (You can also ask for accounts for people who help you a large amount in working on the package.)  With this account, you can edit `/com/mailer/aliases' to create a new unmanaged list or add yourself to an existing unmanaged list.  A comment near the beginning of that file explains how to create a Mailman-managed mailing list.     But if you don't want to learn how to do those things, you can alternatively ask   to add you to the bug-reporting list for your program.  To set up a new list, contact  .  You can subscribe to a list managed by Mailman by sending mail to the corresponding `-request' address.     You should moderate postings from non-subscribed addresses on your mailing lists, to prevent propagation of unwanted messages (""spam"") to subscribers and to the list archives.  For lists controlled by Mailman, you can do this by setting `Privacy Options - Sender Filter - generic_nonmember_action' to `Hold', and then periodically (daily is best) reviewing the held messages, accepting the real ones and discarding the junk.     When you receive bug reports, keep in mind that bug reports are crucial for your work.  If you don't know about problems, you cannot fix them.  So always thank each person who sends a bug report.     You don't have an obligation to give more response than that, though. The main purpose of bug reports is to help you contribute to the community by improving the next version of the program.  Many of the people who report bugs don't realize this--they think that the point is for you to help them individually.  Some will ask you to focus on that _instead of_ on making the program better.  If you comply with their wishes, you will have been distracted from the job of maintaining the program.     For example, people sometimes report a bug in a vague (and therefore useless) way, and when you ask for more information, they say, ""I just wanted to see if you already knew the solution"" (in which case the bug report would do nothing to help improve the program).  When this happens, you should explain to them the real purpose of bug reports.  (A canned explanation will make this more efficient.)     When people ask you to put your time into helping them use the program, it may seem ""helpful"" to do what they ask.  But it is much _less_ helpful than improving the program, which is the maintainer's real job.     By all means help individual users when you feel like it, if you feel you have the time available.  But be careful to limit the amount of time you spend doing this--don't let it eat away the time you need to maintain the program!  Know how to say no; when you are pressed for time, just ""thanks for the bug report--I will fix it"" is enough response.     Some GNU packages, such as Emacs and GCC, come with advice about how to make bug reports useful.  If you want to copy and adapt that, it could be a very useful thing to do.  8 Recording Old Versions ************************  It is very important to keep backup files of all source files of GNU. You can do this using a source control system (such as RCS, CVS, Git, ...) if you like.  The easiest way to use RCS or CVS is via the Version Control library in Emacs (*note Concepts of Version Control: (emacs)VC Concepts.).     The history of previous revisions and log entries is very important for future maintainers of the package, so even if you do not make it publicly accessible, be careful not to put anything in the repository or change log that you would not want to hand over to another maintainer some day.     The GNU Project provides a server that GNU software packages can use for source control and other package needs: `savannah.gnu.org'.  You don't have to use this repository, but if you plan to allow public read-only access to your development sources, it is convenient for people to be able to find various GNU packages in a central place. Savannah is managed by  .     All GNU maintainers are encouraged to take advantage of Savannah, as sharing such a central point can serve to foster a sense of community among GNU developers and help in keeping up with project management.  9 Distributions ***************  It is important to follow the GNU conventions when making GNU software distributions.  9.1 Distribution tar Files ==========================  The tar file for version M.N of program `foo' should be named `foo-M.N.tar'.  It should unpack into a subdirectory named `foo-M.N'. Tar files should not unpack into files in the current directory, because this is inconvenient if the user happens to unpack into a directory with other files in it.     Here is how the `Makefile' for Bison creates the tar file.  This method is good for other programs.       dist: bison.info              echo bison-`sed -e '/version_string/!d' \                -e 's/[^0-9.]*\([0-9.]*\).*/\1/' -e q version.c` > .fname              -rm -rf `cat .fname`              mkdir `cat .fname`              dst=`cat .fname`; for f in $(DISTFILES); do \                 ln $(srcdir)/$$f $$dst/$$f || { echo copying $$f; \                   cp -p $(srcdir)/$$f $$dst/$$f ; } \              done              tar --gzip -chf `cat .fname`.tar.gz `cat .fname`              -rm -rf `cat .fname` .fname     Source files that are symbolic links to other file systems cannot be installed in the temporary directory using `ln', so use `cp' if `ln' fails.     Using Automake is a good way to take care of writing the `dist' target.  9.2 Distribution Patches ========================  If the program is large, it is useful to make a set of diffs for each release, against the previous important release.     At the front of the set of diffs, put a short explanation of which version this is for and which previous version it is relative to.  Also explain what else people need to do to update the sources properly (for example, delete or rename certain files before installing the diffs).     The purpose of having diffs is that they are small.  To keep them small, exclude files that the user can easily update.  For example, exclude info files, DVI files, tags tables, output files of Bison or Flex.  In Emacs diffs, we exclude compiled Lisp files, leaving it up to the installer to recompile the patched sources.     When you make the diffs, each version should be in a directory suitably named--for example, `gcc-2.3.2' and `gcc-2.3.3'.  This way, it will be very clear from the diffs themselves which version is which.     If you use GNU `diff' to make the patch, use the options `-rc2P'. That will put any new files into the output as ""entirely different."" Also, the patch's context diff headers should have dates and times in Universal Time using traditional Unix format, so that patch recipients can use GNU `patch''s `-Z' option.  For example, you could use the following Bourne shell command to create the patch:       LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -rc2P gcc-2.3.2 gcc-2.3.3 | \      gzip -9 >gcc-2.3.2-2.3.3.patch.gz     If the distribution has subdirectories in it, then the diffs probably include some files in the subdirectories.  To help users install such patches reliably, give them precise directions for how to run patch. For example, say this:       To apply these patches, cd to the main directory of the program      and then use `patch -p1'.   `-p1' avoids guesswork in choosing      which subdirectory to find each file in.     It's wise to test your patch by applying it to a copy of the old version, and checking that the result exactly matches the new version.  9.3 Distribution on `ftp.gnu.org' =================================  GNU packages are distributed through directory `/gnu' on `ftp.gnu.org'. Each package should have a subdirectory named after the package, and all the distribution files for the package should go in that subdirectory.     *Note Automated FTP Uploads::, for procedural details of putting new versions on `ftp.gnu.org'.  9.4 Test Releases =================  When you release a greatly changed new major version of a program, you might want to do so as a pretest.  This means that you make a tar file, but send it only to a group of volunteers that you have recruited.  (Use a suitable GNU mailing list/newsgroup to recruit them.)     We normally use the FTP server `alpha.gnu.org' for pretests and prerelease versions.  *Note Automated FTP Uploads::, for procedural details of putting new versions on `alpha.gnu.org'.     Once a program gets to be widely used and people expect it to work solidly, it is a good idea to do pretest releases before each ""real"" release.     There are two ways of handling version numbers for pretest versions. One method is to treat them as versions preceding the release you are going to make.     In this method, if you are about to release version 4.6 but you want to do a pretest first, call it 4.5.90.  If you need a second pretest, call it 4.5.91, and so on.  If you are really unlucky and ten pretests are not enough, after 4.5.99 you could advance to 4.5.990 and so on. (You could also use 4.5.100, but 990 has the advantage of sorting in the right order.)     The other method is to attach a date to the release number that is coming.  For a pretest for version 4.6, made on Dec 10, 2002, this would be 4.6.20021210.  A second pretest made the same day could be 4.6.20021210.1.     For development snapshots that are not formal pretests, using just the date without the version numbers is ok too.     One thing that you should never do is to release a pretest with the same version number as the planned real release.  Many people will look only at the version number (in the tar file name, in the directory name that it unpacks into, or wherever they can find it) to determine whether a tar file is the latest version.  People might look at the test release in this way and mistake it for the real release. Therefore, always change the number when you release changed code.  9.5 Automated FTP Uploads =========================  In order to upload new releases to `ftp.gnu.org' or `alpha.gnu.org', you first need to register the necessary information.  Then, you can perform uploads yourself, with no intervention needed by the system administrators.     The general idea is that releases should be crytographically signed before they are made publicly available.  9.5.1 Automated Upload Registration -----------------------------------  Here is how to register your information so you can perform uploads for your GNU package:    1. Create an account for yourself at `http://savannah.gnu.org', if      you don't already have one.  By the way, this is also needed to      maintain the web pages at `www.gnu.org' for your project (*note      Web Pages::).    2. In the `My Account Conf' page on `savannah', upload the GPG key      you will use to sign your packages.  You can create a key with the      command `gpg --gen-key'.  (For full information about GPG, see      `http://www.gnu.org/software/gpg').    3. Send a message, preferably GPG-signed, to        with the following:         1. Name of package(s) that you are the maintainer for, and your           preferred email address.         2. An ASCII armored copy of your GnuPG key, as an attachment.           (`gpg --export -a YOUR_KEY_ID >mykey.asc' should give you           this.)         3. A list of names and preferred email addresses of other           individuals you authorize to make releases for which           packages, if any (in the case that you don't make all           releases yourself).         4. ASCII armored copies of GnuPG keys for any individuals listed           in (3).     The administrators will acknowledge your message when they have added the proper GPG keys as authorized to upload files for the corresponding packages.  9.5.2 Automated Upload Procedure --------------------------------  Once you have registered your information as described in the previous section, you will be able to do ftp uploads for yourself using the following procedure.     For each upload destined for `ftp.gnu.org' or `alpha.gnu.org', three files (a ""triplet"") need to be uploaded via ftp to the host `ftp-upload.gnu.org'.    1. The file to be distributed (for example, `foo.tar.gz').    2. Detached GPG binary signature for (1), made using `gpg -b' (for      example, `foo.tar.gz.sig').    3. A clearsigned ""directive file"", made using `gpg --clearsign' (for      example, `foo.tar.gz.directive.asc').     The names of the files are important. The signature file must have the same name as the file to be distributed, with an additional `.sig' extension. The directive file must have the same name as the file to be distributed, with an additional `.directive.asc' extension. If you do not follow this naming convention, the upload _will not be processed_.     Since v1.1 of the upload script, it is also possible to upload a clearsigned directive file on its own (no accompanying `.sig' or any other file) to perform certain operations on the server.  *Note FTP Upload Directive File - v1.1::, for more information.     Upload the file(s) via anonymous ftp to `ftp-upload.gnu.org'. If the upload is destined for `ftp.gnu.org', place the file(s) in the `/incoming/ftp' directory. If the upload is destined for `alpha.gnu.org', place the file(s) in the `/incoming/alpha' directory.     Uploads are processed every five minutes.  Uploads that are in progress while the upload processing script is running are handled properly, so do not worry about the timing of your upload.  Uploaded files that belong to an incomplete triplet are deleted automatically after 24 hours.     Your designated upload email addresses (*note Automated Upload Registration::) are sent a message if there are any problems processing an upload for your package. You also receive a message when your upload has been successfully processed.     One relatively easy way to create and transfer the necessary files is to use the `gnupload' script, which is available from the `build-aux/' directory of the `gnulib' project at `http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib'.  `gnupload' can also remove uploaded files.  Run `gnupload --help' for a description and examples.     `gnupload' uses the `ncftpput' program to do the actual transfers; if you don't happen to have the `ncftp' package installed, the `ncftpput-ftp' script in the `build-aux/' directory of `gnulib'. serves as a replacement which uses plain command line `ftp'.     If you have difficulties processing an upload, email  .  9.5.3 FTP Upload Directive File - v1.1 --------------------------------------  The directive file name must end in `directive.asc'.     When part of a triplet, the directive file must always contain the directives `version', `directory' and `filename', as described. In addition, a 'comment' directive is allowed.     The `version' directive must always have the value `1.1'.     The `directory' directive specifies the final destination directory where the uploaded file and its `.sig' companion are to be placed.     The `filename' directive must contain the name of the file to be distributed (item (1) above).     For example, as part of an uploaded triplet, a `foo.tar.gz.directive.asc' file might contain these lines (before being gpg clearsigned):       version: 1.1      directory: bar/v1      filename: foo.tar.gz      comment: hello world!     This directory line indicates that `foo.tar.gz' and `foo.tar.gz.sig' are part of package `bar'.  If you uploaded this triplet to `/incoming/ftp' and the system positively authenticates the signatures, the files `foo.tar.gz' and `foo.tar.gz.sig' will be placed in the directory `gnu/bar/v1' of the `ftp.gnu.org' site.     The directive file can be used to create currently non-existent directory trees, as long as they are under the package directory for your package (in the example above, that is `bar').     If you upload a file that already exists in the FTP directory, the original will simply be archived and replaced with the new upload.  Standalone directives ---------------------  When uploaded by itself, the directive file must contain one or more of the directives `symlink', `rmsymlink' or `archive', in addition to the obligatory `directory' and `version' directives.  A `filename' directive is not allowed, and a `comment' directive remains optional.     If you use more than one directive, the directives are executed in the sequence they are specified in.     Here are a few examples.  The first removes a symlink:       version: 1.1      directory: bar/v1      rmsymlink: foo-latest.tgz      comment: remove a symlink  Archive an old file, taking it offline:       version: 1.1      directory: bar/v1      archive: foo-1.1.tar.gz      comment: archive an old file; it will not be available through FTP anymore  Archive an old directory (with all contents), taking it offline:       version: 1.1      directory: bar/v1      archive: foo      comment: archive an old directory; it will not be available through FTP anymore  Create a new symlink:       version: 1.1      directory: bar/v1      symlink: foo-1.2.tar.gz foo-latest.tgz      comment: create a new symlink  Do everything at once:       version: 1.1      directory: bar/v1      rmsymlink: foo-latest.tgz      symlink: foo-1.2.tar.gz foo-latest.tgz      archive: foo-1.1.tar.gz      comment: now do everything at once  9.5.4 FTP Upload Directive File - v1.0 --------------------------------------  ""As of June 2006, the upload script is running in compatibility mode, allowing uploads with either version 1.1 or version 1.0 of the directive file syntax.  Support for v1.0 uploads will be phased out by the end of 2006, so please upgrade to v1.1.""     The directive file should contain one line, excluding the clearsigned data GPG that inserts, which specifies the final destination directory where items (1) and (2) are to be placed.     For example, the `foo.tar.gz.directive.asc' file might contain the single line:       directory: bar/v1     This directory line indicates that `foo.tar.gz' and `foo.tar.gz.sig' are part of package `bar'.  If you were to upload the triplet to `/incoming/ftp', and the system can positively authenticate the signatures, then the files `foo.tar.gz' and `foo.tar.gz.sig' will be placed in the directory `gnu/bar/v1' of the `ftp.gnu.org' site.     The directive file can be used to create currently non-existent directory trees, as long as they are under the package directory for your package (in the example above, that is `bar').  9.6 Announcing Releases =======================  When you have a new release, please make an announcement.  For official new releases, including those made just to fix bugs, we strongly recommend using the (moderated) general GNU announcements list,  .  Doing so makes it easier for users and developers to find the latest GNU releases.  On the other hand, please do not announce test releases on `info-gnu' unless it's an unusual situation.     Please also post release announcements in the news section of your Savannah project site.  It is fine to also write news entries for test releases and any other newsworthy events.  The news feeds from all GNU projects at savannah are aggregated at `http://planet.gnu.org'.  (You can also post items directly, or arrange for feeds from other locations; see contact information on the GNU Planet web page.)     You can maintain your own mailing list (typically  ) for announcements as well if you like.  For your own list, of course you can decide as you see fit what events are worth announcing.  (*Note Mail::, for more suggestions on handling mail for your package.)  10 Web Pages ************  Please write web pages about your package for installation on `www.gnu.org'.  They should follow our usual standards for web pages (see `http://www.gnu.org/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html').  The overall goals are to support a wide variety of browsers, to focus on information rather than flashy eye candy, and to keep the site simple and uniform.     The simplest way to maintain the web pages for your project is to register the project on `savannah.gnu.org'.  Then you can edit the pages using CVS.  You can keep the source files there too, but if you want to use `savannah.gnu.org' only for the web pages, simply register a ""web-only"" project.     If you don't want to use that method, please talk with   about other possible methods.  For instance, you can mail them pages to install, if necessary.  But that is more work for them, so please use CVS if you can.     Some GNU packages have just simple web pages, but the more information you provide, the better.  So please write as much as you usefully can, and put all of it on `www.gnu.org'.  However, pages that access databases (including mail logs and bug tracking) are an exception; set them up on whatever site is convenient for you, and make the pages on `www.gnu.org' link to that site.     Historically, web pages for GNU packages did not include GIF images, because of patent problems (*note Ethical and Philosophical Consideration::).  Although the GIF patents expired in 2006, using GIF images is still not recommended, as the PNG and JPEG formats are generally superior.  See `http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html'.     If you use a site other than `www.gnu.org', please make sure that the site runs on free software alone.  (It is ok if the site uses unreleased custom software, since that is free in a trivial sense: there's only one user and it has the four freedoms.)  If the web site for a GNU package runs on non-free software, the public will see this, and it will have the effect of granting legitimacy to the non-free program.     If you use multiple sites, they should all follow that criterion. Please don't link to a site that is about your package, which the public might perceive as connected with it and reflecting the position of its developers, unless it follows that criterion.     The web pages for the package should include its manuals, in HTML, DVI, Info, PostScript, PDF, plain ASCII, and Texinfo format (source). (All of these can be generated automatically from the Texinfo source using Makeinfo and other programs.)  When there is only one manual, put it in a subdirectory called `manual'; the file `manual/index.html' should have a link to the manual in each of its forms.     If the package has more than one manual, put each one in a subdirectory of `manual', set up `index.html' in each subdirectory to link to that manual in all its forms, and make `manual/index.html' link to each manual through its subdirectory.     See the section below for details on a script to make the job of creating all these different formats and index pages easier.     We would like to include links to all these manuals in the page `http://www.gnu.org/manual'.  Just send mail to `webmasters@gnu.org' telling them the name of your package and asking them to edit `http://www.gnu.org/manual', and they will do so based on the contents of your `manual' directory.  10.1 Invoking `gendocs.sh' ==========================  The script `gendocs.sh' eases the task of generating the Texinfo documentation output for your web pages section above.  It has a companion template file, used as the basis for the HTML index pages. Both are available from the Texinfo CVS sources:  `http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/texinfo/texinfo/util/gendocs.sh' `http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/texinfo/texinfo/util/gendocs_template'     There is also a minimalistic template, available from:  `http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/texinfo/texinfo/util/gendocs_template_min'     Invoke the script like this, in the directory containing the Texinfo source:       gendocs.sh --email YOURBUGLIST YOURMANUAL ""GNU YOURMANUAL manual""  where YOURMANUAL is the short name for your package and YOURBUGLIST is the email address for bug reports (typically `bug-PACKAGE@gnu.org'). The script processes the file `YOURMANUAL.texinfo' (or `.texi' or `.txi').  For example:       cd .../emacs/man      # download gendocs.sh and gendocs_template      gendocs.sh --email bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org emacs ""GNU Emacs manual""     `gendocs.sh' creates a subdirectory `manual/' containing the manual generated in all the standard output formats: Info, HTML, DVI, and so on, as well as the Texinfo source.  You then need to move all those files, retaining the subdirectories, into the web pages for your package.     You can specify the option `-o OUTDIR' to override the name `manual'.  Any previous contents of OUTDIR will be deleted.     The second argument, with the description, is included as part of the HTML ` ' of the overall `manual/index.html' file.  It should include the name of the package being documented, as shown. `manual/index.html' is created by substitution from the file `gendocs_template'.  (Feel free to modify the generic template for your own purposes.)     If you have several manuals, you'll need to run this script several times with different arguments, specifying a different output directory with `-o' each time, and moving all the output to your web page.  Then write (by hand) an overall index.html with links to them all.  For example:       cd .../texinfo/doc      gendocs.sh --email bug-texinfo@gnu.org -o texinfo texinfo ""GNU Texinfo manual""      gendocs.sh --email bug-texinfo@gnu.org -o info info ""GNU Info manual""      gendocs.sh --email bug-texinfo@gnu.org -o info-stnd info-stnd ""GNU info-stnd manual""     By default, the script uses `makeinfo' for generating HTML output. If you prefer to use `texi2html', use the `--texi2html' command line option, e.g.:       gendocs --texi2html -o texinfo texinfo ""GNU Texinfo manual""     The template files will automatically produce entries for additional HTML output generated by `texi2html' (i.e., split by sections and chapters).     You can set the environment variables `MAKEINFO', `TEXI2DVI', `TEXI2HTML' and `DVIPS' to control the programs that get executed, and `GENDOCS_TEMPLATE_DIR' to control where the `gendocs_template' file is found.     As usual, run `gendocs.sh --help' for a description of all the options, environment variables, and more information.     Please email bug reports, enhancement requests, or other correspondence to <bug-texinfo@gnu.org>.  10.2 CVS Keywords in Web Pages ==============================  Since `www.gnu.org' works through CVS, CVS keywords in your manual, such as `$Log: maintain.txt,v $ such as `Revision 1.40  2009/01/01 22:47:01  karl such as `gendocs.sh accepts --email such as `', need special treatment (even if you don't happen to maintain your manual in CVS).     If these keywords end up in the generated output as literal strings, they will be expanded.  The most robust way to handle this is to turn off keyword expansion for such generated files.  For existing files, this is done with:       cvs admin -ko FILE1 FILE2 ...  For new files:       cvs add -ko FILE1 FILE2 ...     *Note Keyword substitution: (cvs)Keyword substitution.     In Texinfo source, the recommended way to literally specify a ""dollar"" keyword is:       @w{$}Log$     The `@w' prevents keyword expansion in the Texinfo source itself. Also, `makeinfo' notices the `@w' and generates output avoiding the literal keyword string.  11 Ethical and Philosophical Consideration ******************************************  The GNU project takes a strong stand for software freedom.  Many times, this means you'll need to avoid certain technologies when their use would conflict with our long-term goals.     Software patents threaten the advancement of free software and freedom to program.  There are so many software patents in the US that any large program probably implements hundreds of patented techniques, unknown to the program's developers.  It would be futile and self-defeating to try to find and avoid all these patents.  But there are some patents which we know are likely to be used to threaten free software, so we make an effort to avoid the patented techniques.  If you are concerned about the danger of a patent and would like advice, write to <maintainers@gnu.org>, and we will try to help you get advice from a lawyer.     Sometimes the GNU project takes a strong stand against a particular patented technology in order to encourage society to reject it.     For example, the MP3 audio format is covered by a software patent in the USA and some other countries.  A patent holder has threatened lawsuits against the developers of free programs (these are not GNU programs) to produce and play MP3, and some GNU/Linux distributors are afraid to include them.  Development of the programs continues, but we campaign for the rejection of MP3 format in favor of Ogg Vorbis format.     A GNU package should not recommend use of any non-free program, nor should it require a non-free program (such as a non-free compiler or IDE) to build.  Thus, a GNU package cannot be written in a progra  "

Sign Up Discuss  in my Forum   UNC By  Bradley Mitchell , About.com    Filed In: Windows Networking                Definition:  UNC  is a naming convention used primarily to specify and map network drives in Microsoft Windows. Support for UNC also appears in other operating systems via technologies like  Samba . UNC names are most commonly used to reach file servers or printers on a  LAN .   UNC Name Syntax    UNC names identify network resources using a specific notation. UNC names consist of three parts - a server name, a share name, and an optional file path. These three elements are combined using backslashes as follows:        \\server\share\file_path     The  server  portion of a UNC name references the strings maintained by a network naming service such as  DNS  or  WINS . Server names are set by a system administrator.   The  share  portion of a UNC name references a label created by an administrator or, in some cases, within the operating system. In most versions of Microsoft Windows, for example, the built-in share name  admin$  refers to the root directory of the operating system installation (usually C:\WINNT or C:\WINDOWS).    The  file path  portion of a UNC name references the local subdirectories beneath the share point.   UNC Name Examples   Consider a standard Windows XP computer named  teela . In addition to the built-in admin$ share, say you have also defined a share point called  temp  that is located at C:\temp.  Using UNC names, you would connect to folders on  teela  as follows:      \\teela\admin$ (to reach C:\WINNT)   \\teela\admin$\system32 (to reach C:\WINNT\system32)   \\teela\temp (to reach C:\temp)     Using Windows Explorer or the DOS command prompt, and with proper security credentials, you can map network drives and remotely access folders on a computer by specifying the UNC names.

Got there from kissing ass or got lucky.  b) Dumb, overly nice 99% of the time, but blows up suddenly when things do not go well turning into dumb assholes  c) Dumb & Complete Assholes all the time  d) Smart and Complete Assholes all the time                   Vote up           Vote down                       31             0             1555             1028                                                 Save Share Send                                    Tags:  .net ,  agile ,  microsoft ,  opinion                                        Upcoming Links       See all the newest links                                              Office 14 Revealed: Part 1 - Integration of Volume Activation 2.0                        Windows 7 on older hardware: A Catch 22 for Microsoft                        If They Are Genuinely Defining Your Work Culture, You Probably Don't Even Know It.

Enabling your SVN account    Once you've got your Apache account working you need to enable SVN access; See this document for details of using  svnpasswd    http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html    Configuring SVN    You should follow  this guide  to setup your EOL settings.    Getting Karma in JIRA and Confluence    Mail the dev list and ask for karma for JIRA / Confluence giving them details of your username you used to register with them both. We can then grant the necessary karma so you can start grabbing JIRA issues or editing the wiki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Overview       Index    News    New Features    Getting Started    FAQ    Articles    Download       Search                                   Sub Projects       Camel    CMS    NMS       Community       Support    Contributing    Discussion Forums    Mailing Lists    IRC    IRC Log    Site    Sponsorship    Projects Using ActiveMQ    Users    Team       Features       Advisory Message    Clustering    Cross Language Clients    Enterprise Integration Patterns    JMX    JMS to JMS Bridge    MasterSlave    Message Groups    Networks of Brokers    Performance    Persistence    Security    Virtual Destinations    Visualisation    More ...

When a field is declared transient, it would not be  serialized  even if the class to which it belongs is serialized. It must be noted that in Java, methods, classes and interfaces cannot be declared as transient. [ 1 ]   In  Hibernate ,  transient  describes an object that has been instantiated, but is not associated with a Hibernate session, i. e. the object resides in memory but is not being persisted. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   X          A dialog box is an example of a transient window.       In the  X Window System , a window is said to be  transient   for  another window if it belongs to that other window and may not outlast it: a dialog box, such as an alert message, is a common example. This should not be confused with a window containing another window: contained windows lie entirely within their parents, but transients are separate windows which can generally be moved freely around the screen. Transient windows may be treated specially by the  window manager , and unlike top-level windows (which can require user placement, as in  twm ), must never require any user interaction on appearing.

(December 2006)       Transient  also refers to a module that, once loaded into main  memory , is expected to remain in memory for a short time. Today, the term is rarely used, and may be obsolete.   In the mid-to-late 1960s, mainframe computers, such as the  IBM System/360 , had memory sizes from 8  KB  to 512 KB. In order to conserve memory, transients were small modules that supported a specific task, and were swapped in and out of memory. The operating system for the 360 had two areas reserved for transients that supported input/output operations. These were referred to as the logical transient area, and the physical transient area. If an application program, for example, needed to use the printer, transients that supported printing were brought into the transient areas. If an application needed to use tape drives, transients that supported tape drive access were brought into the transient areas.       [ edit ]   Message Passing   At the level of  message passing , transient communication means the way by which the messages are not saved into a buffer to wait for its deliver at the message receiver. The messages will be delivered  only  if both the systems (sender and receiver) are running.

This task is easy in Cocoa/Objective-C, although it requires digging through a few class references in the documentation.  If you need a more complicated expansion of a string, at least this code will give you a starting point.

A left join contains all of the rows from the primary table plus related members of the second database if they exist. Using joins can significantly reduce the number of database queries required to render a web page.  This Tech-Recipe describes how to do a left join in Symfony using Propel.

If you’ve unintentionally created an application or no longer need an app and want to do housecleaning, this Tech-Recipe describes how to get it gone.

If you are running MySQL locally, this should work for you with no additional configuration.  If you are running MySQL on another server, as is common in shared web hosting and other environments, you’ll get an error.  In the past, I’ve just grunted and sent the SQL code to the database manually, but there is an easy fix to make things work as they should.

We have the very best of intentions to change this number right after the big ball drops in Times Square each year.  We’re also human and, all too often, I see websites with copyright notices that are years behind.  If your website is PHP-powered, this quick bit of code will put the current year in your copyright notice and off of your mind.

This is due to the default settings, as they keep the original structure and basic formatting of the originating application.  Fortunately, the defaults can be changed to better meet your main needs and using Paste Special can be used for situations that require different settings.

Usually, you can just avoid the extreme circumstances, and the bug isn't a problem. You could duplicate the effect of tickling the bug by writing your own program, if ...

You can use this feature to change the brightness of the entire screen.   The SetDeviceGammaRamp API function receive an array of 256 RGB values.  Increasing the values in this array will make your screen brighter, and decreasing these values will make your screen darker. You can also increase or decrease the intesity of the red/green/blue components. For example: Increasing the blue component in all RGB values will add more blue color  to the entire display.     The following class encapsulates the calls to GetDeviceGammaRamp and SetDeviceGammaRamp, and provides the SetBrightness function for setting the brightness of the screen.

Command Reference         2.1  gem build  -- Build a gem file from a specification      The build command is used by developers to package their Ruby software into a single gem file that can be distributed.  The build command requires a gemspec file to describe the metadata in the packge.  You can see a good example of using build in CreateAGemInTenMinutes.      A yaml file containing the Gem::Specification object built by a gemspec (instead of a gemspec file) may also be also be used with the build command.      Usage     Usage: gem build GEMSPEC_FILE [options]    Common Options:         --source URL                 Use URL as the remote source for gems     -p, --[no-]http-proxy [URL]      Use HTTP proxy for remote operations     -h, --help                       Get help on this command         --config-file FILE           Use this config file instead of default         --backtrace                  Show stack backtrace on errors         --debug                      Turn on Ruby debugging    Arguments:     GEMSPEC_FILE      name of gemspec file used to build the gem    Summary:     Build a gem from a gemspec      Examples      This example builds a the rake package from a gemspec file.     $ gem build rake.gemspec  Attempting to build gem spec 'rake.gemspec'   Successfully built RubyGem   Name: rake   Version: 0.4.0   File: rake-0.4.0.gem      Of course, rake isn’t normally built from a gemspec.  It uses a special gem building task to build the gem directly from the rakefile. See CreateAGemUsingRake for more details.     $ rake gem (in /home/jim/working/rubyforge/rake)   Successfully built RubyGem   Name: rake   Version: 0.4.0   File: rake-0.4.0.gem               2.2  gem cert  -- Support signing and managing signed gems      The cert command manages the certificates needed to sign gems.

See the  chapter on signing gems  in the :Ruby Users Guide”:http://docs.rubygems.org/read/book/1 for details.      Examples      Build a private key and certificate for gemmaster@example.com. Substitute your own email address for your own certificates.     $ gem cert --build gemmaster@example.com     Add a certificate to the list of trusted certificates.  The trusted certificate list will be consulted when installing signed gems.     $ gem cert --add gem-public_cert.pem     Sign a certificate with the specified key and certificate (note that this modifies client_cert.pem!)     $ gem cert \      -K /mnt/floppy/issuer-priv_key.pem \      -C issuer-pub_cert.pem \      --sign client_cert.pem               2.3  gem check  -- Check installed gems for problems      The check command is used to verify that a gem in is good working order.      Usage     Usage: gem check [options]    Options:     -v, --verify FILE                Verify gem file against its internal checksum     -a, --alien                      Report 'unmanaged' or rogue files in the gem repository     -t, --test                       Run unit tests for gem     -V, --version                    Specify version for which to run unit tests    Common Options:         --source URL                 Use URL as the remote source for gems     -p, --[no-]http-proxy [URL]      Use HTTP proxy for remote operations     -h, --help                       Get help on this command         --config-file FILE           Use this config file instead of default         --backtrace                  Show stack backtrace on errors         --debug                      Turn on Ruby debugging    Summary:     Check installed gems      The  verify  option checks a gem file for corruption.  If the file is not exactly like it was built, verify will complain.  (Note: This is a simple integrity check.  It is not checking for  PGP  like signatures).      The  alien  option checks an installed gem to see if any of the files have been tampered with.      Examples      The following check is run against a valid rake gem file.     $ gem check -v pkg/rake-0.4.0.gem  Verifying gem: 'pkg/rake-0.4.0.gem'      The following check shows that the rake gem file is invalid.     $ gem check -v pkg/rake-0.4.0.gem Verifying gem: 'pkg/rake-0.4.0.gem' ERROR:  pkg/rake-0.4.0.gem is invalid.
