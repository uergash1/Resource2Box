The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) created one of the first.  HUD's Reverse Mortgage is a federally-insured private loan, and it's a safe plan that can give older Americans greater financial security. Many Seniors use it to supplement social security, meet unexpected medical expenses, make home improvements, and more.  You can receive free information from HUD about Reverse Mortgages by calling 1-800-217-6970, toll-free.     Since your home is probably your largest single investment, it's smart to know more about reverse mortgages, and decide if one is right for you!       1.  What is a reverse mortgage?    A reverse mortgage is a special type of home loan that lets a homeowner convert the equity in his or her home into cash.  The equity built up over years of home mortgage payments can be paid to the homeowner:  in a lump sum, in a stream of payments, or as a supplement to Social Security or other retirement funds.  But unlike a traditional home equity loan or second mortgage, no repayment is required until the borrowers no longer use the home as their principal residence.  HUD's reverse mortgage provides these benefits, and it is federally-insured as well.    2. Can I qualify for a HUD reverse mortgage?    To be eligible for a HUD reverse mortgage, HUD's Federal Housing Administration requires that you are a homeowner 62 years of age or older; have a very low outstanding mortgage balance or own your home free and clear; and that you meet with a HUD-approved counseling agency -- to make sure you understand what a HUD Reverse Mortgage will mean for you.  Call 1-800-217-6970, toll free, for more information.    3.  Can I apply if I didn't buy my present house with FHA mortgage insurance?    Yes.  While your property must meet FHA minimum standards, it doesn't matter if you didn't buy it with an FHA-insured mortgage.  Your new HUD reverse mortgage will be a new FHA-insured mortgage loan.    4.  What if I own a condominium, not a single-family home?    You can still qualify for HUD's reverse mortgage program.  An eligible property must be your principal residence, but can be a single-family residence; a one- to four-unit dwelling with one unit occupied by the borrower; a manufactured home (mobile home); a unit in FHA-approved condominiums; and Planned Unit Developments.  Your property must meet FHA minimum property standards, but you can fund repairs from your reverse mortgage.    5.  What's the difference between a reverse mortgage and a bank home equity loan?     With a traditional second mortgage, or a home equity line of credit, you must have sufficient income to qualify for the loan, and you are required to make monthly mortgage payments.  A reverse mortgage works very differently.  The reverse mortgage pays you, and it is available regardless of your current income.  You don't make payments, because the loan is not due as long as the house is your principal residence.  Like all homeowners, you still are required to pay your real estate taxes and other conventional payments like utilities, but with an FHA-insured HUD Reverse Mortgage, you cannot be foreclosed or forced to vacate your house because you ""missed your mortgage payment.""    6.  Can the lender take my home away if I outlive the loan?     No! You cannot outlive the loan agreement, and no debt from a Reverse Mortgage will be passed along to the estate or heirs. You cannot be forced to sell your home to pay off the mortgage loan even if the loan balance grows to exceed the value of the property And, HUD's Federal Housing Administration guarantees that you'll receive all the payments that are owed to you.    7.  Will I still have an estate that I can leave to my heirs?     When you sell your home or no longer use it for your primary residence, you or your estate will repay the cash you received from the reverse mortgage, plus interest and other finance charges, to the lender.  All proceeds beyond what you owe belong to you or your estate.  This means the remaining equity in your home can be passed on to your heirs.  None of your other assets will be affected by HUD's reverse mortgage loan.  No debt will ever be passed along to the estate or heirs.  You retain ownership of your home, and may sell or move at any time.    8. How much money can I get from my home?    A borrower who uses an FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) will receive a reverse mortgage amount based on a formula which includes a Maximum Claim Amount. In general, this means the maximum amount you can receive will be determined by factors including the age of the borrower(s),  and the appraised value of the property (or the maximum FHA mortgage amount for your area, if lower). For example, based on a loan at recent interest rates, a 65-year-old could borrow up to 26 percent of the home's value, a 75-year-old could borrow up to 39 percent, and an 85- year-old could borrow up to 56 percent. You should discuss the formula with your lender and your HUD-approved housing counselor.    9.  What if I want to take out more equity from my home than the FHA-insured mortgage limits for my area?    Like FHA's home mortgage programs, HUD's reverse mortgage is primarily intended for low- and moderate-income families.   For instance, FHA maximum home mortgage amounts range from $78,660 to $155,250, depending whether the home is in a standard housing-cost area, or an area determined by FHA to be a high-cost area.  An owner with a property valued well beyond the FHA mortgage limits, and who has a large amount of equity, will not receive as much cash from a HECM as they might from another reputable private or public agency.  Reverse mortgage programs are available in most states of the nation, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, through HUD-approved lenders or highly regarded organizations like Fannie Mae.  However, anyone interested in a reverse mortgage is encouraged to speak with a HUD-approved housing counseling agency first.    10.  Should I use an estate planning service to find a reverse mortgage?  I've been contacted by a firm that will give me the name of a lender for a ""small percentage"" of the loan?    HUD does NOT recommend using an estate planning service, or any service that charges a fee just for referring a borrower to a lender!  HUD provides this information without cost, and HUD-approved housing-counseling agencies are available for free, or at minimal cost, to provide counseling and free referral to a list of HUD-approved lenders.     Before you agree to pay a fee for a simple referral, call 1-888-466-3487, toll-free, for the name and location of a HUD-approved housing counseling agency near you.

The program allows homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes.          Homeowners can receive payments in a lump sum, on a monthly basis (for a fixed term or for as long as they live in the home), or on an occasional basis as a line of credit.  Homeowners whose circumstances change can restructure their payment options.         Unlike ordinary home equity loans, a HUD reverse mortgage does not require repayment as long as the borrower lives in the home. Lenders recover their principal, plus interest, when the home is sold.  The remaining value of the home goes to the homeowner or to his or her survivors.  If the sales proceeds are insufficient to pay the amount owed, HUD will pay the lender the amount of the shortfall.  The Federal Housing Administration, which is part of HUD, collects an insurance premium from all borrowers to provide this coverage.         The size of reverse mortgage loans is determined by the borrower's age, the interest rate, and the home's value. The older a borrower, the larger the percentage of the home's value that can be borrowed.         For example, based on a loan at today's interest rates  of approximately 9 percent, a 65-year-old could borrow up to 26 percent of the home's value, a 75-year-old could borrow up to 39 percent of the home's value, and an 85-year-old could borrow up to 56 percent of the home's value.        There are no asset or income limitations on borrowers receiving HUD's reverse mortgages.        There are also no limits on the value of homes qualifying for a HUD reverse mortgage. However, the amount that may be borrowed is capped by the maximum FHA mortgage limit for the area, which varies from $81,548 to $160,950, depending on local housing costs.  As a result, owners of higher-priced homes can't borrow any more than owners of homes valued at the FHA limit.        HUD's reverse mortgage program collects funds from insurance premiums charged to borrowers.  Senior citizens are charged 2 percent of the home's value as an up-front payment plus one-half percent on the loan balance each year.  These amounts are usually paid by the lender and charged to the borrower's principal balance.         FHA's reverse mortgage insurance makes HUD's program less expensive to borrowers than the smaller reverse mortgage programs run by private lenders without FHA insurance.                                                                                                        Content updated October 28, 2003                                                                                                                                                                Back to Top                                                                                                    U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home

Can I qualify for a HUD reverse mortgage?                               To be eligible for a HUD reverse mortgage, HUD's Federal Housing                Administration (FHA) requires that the borrower is a homeowner,                62 years of age or older; own your home outright, or have a low                mortgage balance that can be paid off at the closing with proceeds                from the reverse loan; and must live in the home. You are further                required to receive consumer information from HUD-approved counseling                sources prior to obtaining the loan. You can contact the Housing                Counseling Clearinghouse on 1-800-569-4287 to obtain the name and                telephone number of a HUD-approved counseling agency and a list                of FHA approved lenders within your area.                                3. Can I apply if I didn't buy my present house with FHA mortgage                insurance?                               Yes. While your property must meet HUD minimum property standards,                it doesn't matter if you didn't buy it with an FHA-insured mortgage.                Your new HUD reverse mortgage will be a new FHA-insured mortgage                loan.                                4. What types of homes are eligible?                               Your home must be a single family dwelling or a two-to-four unit                property that you own and occupy. Townhouses, detached homes, units                in condominiums and some manufactured homes are eligible. Condominiums                must be FHA-approved. It is possible for condominiums to qualify                under the Spot Loan program. The home must be in reasonable condition,                and must meet HUD minimum property standards. In some cases, home                repairs can be made after the closing of a reverse mortgage.                                5. What's the difference between a reverse mortgage and a bank                home equity loan?                               With a traditional second mortgage, or a home equity line of credit,                you must have sufficient income versus debt ratio to qualify for                the loan, and you are required to make monthly mortgage payments.                The reverse mortgage is different in that it pays you, and is available                regardless of your current income. The amount you can borrow depends                on your age, the current interest rate, other loan fees, and the                appraised value of your home or FHA's mortgage limits for your area,                whichever is less. Generally, the more valuable your home is, the                older you are, the lower the interest, the more you can borrow.                You don't make payments, because the loan is not due as long as                the house is your principal residence. Like all homeowners, you                still are required to pay your real estate taxes and other conventional                payments like utilities, but with an FHA-insured HUD Reverse Mortgage,                you cannot be foreclosed or forced to vacate your house because                you ""missed your mortgage payment.""                                6. Can the lender take my home away if I outlive the loan?                               No! Nor is the loan due. You do not need to repay the loan as long                as you or one of the borrowers continues to live in the house and                keeps the taxes and insurance current. You can never owe more than                your home's value.                                7. Will I still have an estate that I can leave to my heirs?                               When you sell your home or no longer use it for your primary residence,                you or your estate will repay the cash you received from the reverse                mortgage, plus interest and other fees, to the lender. The remaining                equity in your home, if any, belongs to you or to your heirs. None                of your other assets will be affected by HUD's reverse mortgage                loan. This debt will never be passed along to the estate or heirs.                                8. How much money can I get from my home?                               The amount you can borrow depends on your age, the current interest                rate, other loan fees and the appraised value of your home or FHA's                mortgage limits for your are, whichever is less. Generally, the                more valuable your home is, the older you are, the lower the interest,                the more you can borrow.                                9. Should I use an estate planning service to find a reverse                mortgage?                 I've                been contacted by a firm that will give me the name of a lender                for a ""small percentage"" of the loan? HUD does NOT recommend using                an estate planning service, or any service that charges a fee just                for referring a borrower to a lender! HUD provides this information                without cost, and HUD-approved housing counseling agencies are available                for free, or at minimal cost, to provide information, counseling,                and free referral to a list of HUD-approved lenders. Before you                agree to pay a fee for a simple referral, call  1-800-569-4287 ,                toll-free, for the name and location of a HUD-approved housing counseling                agency near you.                                10. How do I receive my payments?                               You have five options:                                                             Tenure - equal monthly payments as long as at least one borrower                  lives and continues to occupy the property as a principal residence.                 Term                  - equal monthly payments for a fixed period of months selected.                 Line                  of Credit - unscheduled payments or in installments, at times                  and in amounts of borrower's choosing until the line of credit                  is exhausted.                 Modified                  Tenure - combination of line of credit with monthly payments for                  as long as the borrower remains in the home.                 Modified                  Term - combination of line of credit with monthly payments for                  a fixed period of months selected by the borrower.                                                                                                                                                                      Content updated October 1, 2002                                                                                                                                                 Back to top                                                                                                                U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home"

Utilities impose a disproportionate                burden on the poor. For single, elderly poor and disabled persons                living on Social Security Income (SSI), the average energy burden                was 19 percent of SSI. In selected States—Delaware, Illinois,                and Vermont—it was nearly 25 percent.               For Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the energy                burden was, on average, seven times greater than for families at                median income. AFDC families paid an average of 26 percent of their                income toward energy, while median income families spent an average                of less than 4 percent of their income on energy.

The  National                Energy Assistance Directors’ Association  released a study                on April 5, 2001, that finds "" Millions                at Risk for Energy Cutoff "". The results of a study showing                that as many as 3.6 million families in 18 states, plus the District                of Columbia, risk having their energy cut off because of the effects                of rapidly increasing energy costs. Some states have moratoria on                utility cutoffs during the cold months; some do not. Table 1 of                the study has a summary of arrearage and shutoff information.                             Utility                cutoffs cause homelessness. You can document this in your own communities                by following the example of Greg Copeland of the Energy Cents Coalition                in St. Paul, Minnesota. “FROM HEATLESS TO HOMELESS” is                a study based on research of 1997 St. Paul municipal records on                evictions due to condemnation. Energy Cents’ analysis revealed:                                                                     26                    percent of evictions were due to electric and gas termination.                                               40                    percent of evictions were due to water cutoffs.                                                                       The termination of service can threaten the home, health, safety,                and perhaps even the life of household members. The extent of the                problem can be documented in other communities and can be added                to the data on needs in a city’s Consolidated Plan.                                                                                                                                                   Content updated November 13, 2001                                                                                                                                    Back to top                                                                                                                U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home"

Purpose:                    The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program                (HECM) can enable an older home owning family to stay in their home                while using some of its built up equity. The program allows such                a household to get an insured reverse mortgage-a mortgage that converts                equity into income. Because older persons can be vulnerable to fraudulent                practices, the program requires that persons receive free reverse                mortgage housing counseling from a HUD-approved reverse mortgage                counseling agency before applying for a reverse mortgage. FHA insures                HECM loans to protect lenders against loss if amounts withdrawn                exceed equity when the property is sold.                   Type of Assistance:                    HECM can be used by homeowners                who are 62 years of age and older. The total income that an owner                can receive through HECM is the maximum claim amount, which is calculated                with a formula including the age of the owner(s), the interest rate,                and the value of the home. For example, on the basis of a loan at                recent interest rates, a 65-year-old could borrow up to 26 percent                of the home's value, a 75-year-old could borrow up to 39 percent,                and an 85-year-old could borrow up to 56 percent.                Borrowers may choose one of five payment options: (1) tenure,                which gives the borrower a monthly payment from the lender for as                long as the borrower lives and continues to occupy the home as a                principal residence; (2) term, which gives the borrower monthly                payments for a fixed period selected by the borrower; (3) line of                credit, which allows the borrower to make withdrawals up to a maximum                amount, at times and in amounts of the borrower's choosing; (4)                modified tenure, which combines the tenure option with a line of                credit; and (5) modified term, which combines the term option with                a line of credit.                The borrower remains the owner of the home and may sell it and                move at any time, keeping the sales proceeds that exceed the mortgage                balance. A borrower cannot be forced to sell the home to pay off                the mortgage, even if the mortgage balance grows to exceed the value                of the property. A HECM loan need not be repaid until the borrower                moves, sells, or dies. When the loan must be paid, if it exceeds                the value of the property, the borrower (or the heirs) will owe                no more than the value of the property. FHA insurance will cover                any balance due the lender.                Two mortgage insurance premiums are collected to pay for HECM:                an up front premium (2 percent of the home's value), which can be                financed by the lender, and a monthly premium (which equals 0.5                percent per year of the mortgage balance). The lender's loan origination                charge can vary, but only up to $1,800 in such charges may be financed                by HECM. Borrowers may be charged appraisal and inspection fees                set by HUD; these charges can also be financed.                As part of the HECM program, HUD has provided for free reverse                mortgage counseling (with training for the counselors) for persons                considering using such an instrument, and a toll-free information                line (1-888-466-3487).                   Eligible Grantees:                    Any lender authorized to make                HUD-insured loans- such as banks, mortgage companies, and savings                and loan associations-can participate in the HECM program.                   Eligible Customers:                    To be eligible for HECM, a                homeowner must (1) be 62 years of age or older, (2) have a very                low outstanding mortgage balance or own their home free and clear,                and (3) have received HUD-approved reverse mortgage counseling to                learn about the program.                An eligible property must be a principal residence, but it can                be a single-family residence, a one- to four-unit building with                one unit occupied by the borrower, a manufactured home (mobile home),                a unit in an FHA-approved condominium, or a unit in a planned unit                development. The property must meet FHA standards, but the owner                can pay for repairs using the reverse mortgage.                 Application:                    Homeowners who meet the eligibility                criteria above can apply through an FHA-approved lending institution,                which in turn submits the application to the local HUD Field Office                for approval. Borrowers can locate FHA-approved lenders through                HUD's  searchable listing .                Because there has been a problem of some senior citizens being                charged thousands of dollars for information on HECM that is available                free, HUD recently directed HECM lenders to stop doing business                with companies that charge such fees.                   Funding Status:                    In FY 1996, the HECM program insured                3,604 homes with a value of $369 million. Through September 30,                1996, approximately 16,000 HECM loans had been made.                   Technical Guidance:                    TECHNICAL GUIDANCE: This program                is authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987,                Section 417, Public Law 100-242 (12 U.S.C. 1715z-20). Program regulations                are in 24 CFR 200 and 206. This program is administered by the Office                of Single-Family Housing in HUD's Office of Housing-Federal Housing                Administration.                   For More Information:                    Homeowners who want to learn                more about this program, or who were charged for HUD approved reverse                mortgage counseling should call HUD's toll-free housing counseling                information line, 1-888-466-3487 or see the  searchable                list of HUD approved reverse mortgage housing counseling agencies                 or call 1-888-466-3487.

HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros said the legislation,  submitted to Congress today, is called The Older Americans Home Security Act of 1996.  It would allow the Federal Housing Administration's reverse mortgage program to continue beyond its scheduled expiration in the year 2000. The bill would also remove the cap that limits the program to insuring 50,000 reverse mortgages.       In addition, Cisneros said HUD will launch a major effort to make more older Americans aware of the reverse mortgage program and to provide counseling to help people determine if they would benefit from a reverse mortgage.       While a traditional mortgage requires a homeowner to make monthly payments to a lender, HUD's reverse mortgage program allows a homeowner age 62 and older to borrow against the value of his or her home. The homeowner receives payments from a lender on a monthly basis, in a lump sum, or as a line of credit. The lender recovers its loan plus interest when the home is sold.       FHA provides insurance on loans made by private lenders to elderly homeowners under the reverse mortgage program.       ""Reverse mortgages reward older Americans who've worked hard all their lives and want to stay in their homes,"" Cisneros said.  ""The cash provided by these innovative loans makes a crucial difference in the lives of elderly homeowners who are house-rich but cash-poor.""        Joseph S. Perkins, President-elect of the American Association of Retired Persons, said AARP supports HUD's legislation to expand its reverse mortgage program.        ""By allowing older people to stay in their homes, reverse mortgages add immeasurably to the quality of their lives,""         Perkins said.       More than 12 million homeowners age 62 and older would be eligible to participate in HUD's expanded reverse mortgage program, and the number eligible would grow as the Baby Boom generation ages.       To qualify for a reverse mortgage, older homeowners must have paid off their home mortgages or have only a small mortgage balance remaining.         A study by Cornell University estimated that over 620,000 poor elderly homeowners could raise their incomes above the poverty level with reverse mortgages. The study found that 87 percent of poor elderly homeowners have paid off their mortgages.       HUD's reverse mortgage program was capped at 50,000 loans and approved to run only until the year 2000 because it began as a demonstration program in 1989. More than 16,000 reverse mortgages have been issued so far under HUD's program.       The program's temporary nature, the loan cap, a shortage of counselors and limited outreach efforts to publicize reverse mortgages combined to hold down lender and borrower participation.        ""The demonstration phase for HUD's reverse mortgage program is over,"" Cisneros said. ""Our program is a success and we need to move ahead to extend its benefits to many more older Americans.""       About 125 lenders issue HUD's reverse mortgages everywhere in the United States except South Dakota (where statutory barriers exist) and Texas (where the State Constitution prohibits reverse mortgages).       Cisneros said the consumer outreach and counseling programs will be launched with $200,000 in HUD funds. He said HUD will ask Congress for permission in fiscal 1997 to shift $1 million in recaptured funds from other HUD programs to reverse mortgage counseling and outreach. HUD will use the funds to:        Expand counseling and education programs to help older homeowners decide if reverse mortgages would benefit them and to protect them from those who would take advantage of the elderly.  Telephone counseling will be offered to older people living in areas where there are shortages of counselors.       Produce brochures, public service announcements for the broadcast and print media, and videotapes explaining how the reverse mortgage program works. The brochures and videos will be distributed to lenders, senior citizen groups and individuals. Information will also be placed on the Internet.       Provide information about FHA reverse mortgage insurance on a toll-free telephone line and mail callers additional material. The toll-free line is 1-800-217-6970.        In addition, AARP will continue to do outreach to inform older Americans about reverse mortgages. HUD will work with other senior citizen organizations as well to also disseminate information to their members.       Among Americans 65 and older, 79.1 percent are homeowners -- the highest rate in history and up from 77.1 percent in 1992. A total of 83 percent of senior citizen homeowners have paid off their home mortgages.       HUD's reverse mortgage program is part of the Administration's National Homeownership Strategy. The strategy is designed to raise the national homeownership rate to an all-time high of 67.5 percent by the year 2000.        Since 1993 the number of American homeowners has increased by more than 3 million families.                                                                                                        Content updated December 5, 2000                                                                                                                                                                Back to Top                                                                                                    U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home"

GX268-91-7323284	"HOUSING  H O U S I N G   HOUSING What factors about my housing situation must I consider when having my grandchild live with me? Space, safety, and privacy needs of the whole family must be considered when a grandchild moves in. As a result, the grandparent may need to think about moving to another residence or making changes to his/her current residence.  What special factors must renters consider when a grandchild moves in?  When living in a rental unit, particularly a government-subsidized facility, the lease usually requires that you advise the rental manager if anyone moves into the dwelling other than those already on the lease. Otherwise, you risk eviction. In government-subsidized housing, adding a grandchild to your household may affect the amount of rent you pay in the future and whether your family can remain in the same rental unit. Any income the child receives is added to the total household income. Also, there are federal guidelines on the number of children who may occupy a given size apartment.  What kind of housing assistance is available for low-income renters?  The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) operates several rental assistance programs to assist lowincome persons and families: Public housing is operated by the local housing authority. ""Section 8"" is a program in which the local housing authority gives the tenant a certificate stating that the government will pay part of the tenant's monthly rent; then the resident locates his/her own housing. Not all counties offer both public and Section 8 housing. Call: 410 396-5548 or 410 396-5594 about public or Section 8 Housing in Baltimore City.  See # 13 in Other Helpful Telephone Numbers for housing offices in Maryland's 23 counties.  44   HOUSING Privately-owned subsidized rental housing is a program in which the government provides subsidies directly to the owner of the housing; then the owner applies those subsidies to the tenant's rent. Applications can be taken by the individual apartment managers. Waiting lists for HUD programs can be lengthy. However, the urgency of a situation can sometimes give an applicant priority for housing, particularly if a social worker from the local Department of Social Services manages your grandchild's case. Ask the social worker about getting priority for housing. To obtain a listing of privately owned subsidized apartment buildings in Maryland, contact the numbers below: Call: Washington HUD Office (Montgomery & Prince George's Counties) 1-202-708-1112 Baltimore HUD Office (Baltimore City and other Maryland Counties) 410 962-2520 and ask for ""The Locator""  Where can I get help in resolving a dispute with my landlord?  Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc., promotes fair housing through education and legal action. This agency provides information on landlord/tenant law, writes letters to landlords and prepares clients for small claims court. Call: 410 243-6007 or 1-800-487-6007  Where can low-income families get information about home ownership, home improvement, and home repair loans?  Call:   410 396-4151 (in Baltimore City) See # 13 under Other Helpful Telephone Numbers for housing offices in Maryland's 23 counties.  45   HOUSING What is a reverse mortgage? Can it help with my family's needs? Seniors who are at least 62 years old and own their home have an alternative not available to renters or to younger homeowners: the ""reverse mortgage."" The reverse mortgage can enable senior homeowners to turn their home into a source of income and thus be in a better position to provide for their grandchildren. Under a reverse mortgage, a lender advances an amount of money, based on the value of the home, to the current owner. A lien is placed on the house, but the senior continues to own it. The lender is paid back the full amount of the loan plus interest when the senior moves permanently or dies. The loan is repaid in one payment, usually through the sale of the house. Generally, the older you are and the more your home is worth, the more money you can borrow. Reverse mortgages can be complicated arrangements. Do not enter into a reverse mortgage agreement without exploring more than one lender's plan and thoroughly understanding the conditions.  Who can I call to learn more about reverse mortgages?  Your local Area Agency on Aging may know the names of lending institutions offering the reverse mortgage in Maryland.  See # 2 under Other Helpful Telephone Numbers The AARP Foundation (American Association of Retired Persons) offers a Home Equity Conversion Information Kit and videotape to help homeowners decide if a reverse mortgage may be right for them.

Purpose:      This initiative plays a key supportive role for Habitat for Humanity projects because Habitat's self-help philosophy prohibits it from accepting Government funds for housing construction.  SHOP funds pay for land and infrastructure, allowing Habitat to use volunteer labor for homebuilding.  Habitat then sells the homes at no profit with an affordable mortgage.      Type of Assistance:      HUD awards SHOP funds as grants.      Eligible Grantees:      Before fiscal year (FY) 1999, Habitat for Humanity International, based in Americus, Georgia, was allocated SHOP funds through Congressional appropriations, separate from other SHOP funding.  Beginning in FY 1999, Habitat must apply for funds under the  SHOP (Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program) .      Eligible Customers:      SHOP benefits low-income families that cannot afford to buy homes but that will volunteer their time to build homes.      Eligible Activities:      Habitat uses SHOP funds to buy land and to make infrastructure improvements (including utility hookups and connections, waste disposal systems, roads, and sidewalks).  The use of SHOP funds cannot exceed an average of $10,000 of assistance per dwelling unit.      Application:      Because Habitat for Humanity International is the only eligible grantee, no application process exists        Funding Status:      Funds were provided for fiscal year (FY) 1996, $25 million and FY 1998, $10.4 million.      Technical Guidance:      This program is authorized by the Housing Opportunity Extension Act of 1996, Section 11.  No separate program regulations exist.  The Office of Affordable Housing Programs at HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) administers the program.

Success Stories:      A 40-unit Habitat project in Jacksonville, Florida, and a 28-home Habitat development in Blount County, Tennessee, are among the new homeownership opportunities supported through this program.

This study is the first to present systematic information collected       from Habitat homeowners and their experiences with homeownership.              Habitat affiliates were successful in making first-time homeowners of       many families with low incomes.  According to the study, Habitat       assisted families are predominantly low income and very low-income       with some families formerly residing in public housing.  Annual       incomes averaged $24,251 for an average 4.1-person household while the       median income was $21,480.  The survey showed that approximately 43%       earned less than 50% of median household income in their respective       areas.  Another 34% earned between 50% and 80% of the median.            Habitat affiliates made homeownership affordable by controlling the       mortgage amount and sales price of the home.  Without       zero-interest-rate loans and very low purchase prices, few program       participants would be able to afford home ownership. The units being       produced through HFHI affiliates are affordable to target buyers as       defined by HUD program guidelines---the sum of principal, interest,       taxes and insurance (PITI) for the surveyed households was below 30       percent of income with a mean ratio of 23.9 percent.  The average       sales price for a Habitat home was $37,782 and the median sales price       set by HFHI affiliates is approximately $33,478.

GX238-13-4700627	"STRATEGIC PLAN FY 2003FY 2008  HUD   HUD STRATEGIC PLAN FY 2003FY 2008  ""I believe there is such a thing as the American Dream. And I believe those of us who have been given positions of responsibility must do everything we can to spotlight the dream and to make sure the dream shines in all neighborhoods, all throughout our country."" -President George W. Bush  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development March 2003   HUD STRATEGIC PLAN MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY MEL MARTINEZ We have worked hard at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to aggressively implement President Bush's housing agenda and to fulfill our obligations to the American people. Our mission is to expand homeownership, increase access to affordable housing free from discrimination, support community development and address the housing needs of society's most vulnerable. For many families, the American Dream means owning their own home. HUD is dedicated to helping more families--especially minorities--realize the dream for themselves. We are breaking down the barriers that lock too many families out of homeownership. We have taken significant steps to make the homebuying process itself less confusing and less expensive. In this way, we are empowering families to know the security of self-sufficiency, helping communities benefit from increased homeownership in their neighborhoods and strengthening the nation as a whole in many measurable ways. While we are passionate about our mission to increase the ranks of America's homeowners, HUD's agenda is broad and covers every aspect of single-family and multifamily housing, the special needs of vulnerable citizens and urban and economic development. Each year, millions of Americans--including low-income families; the elderly; individuals with disabilities; homeless men, women and children; and persons with AIDS-- turn to the Department for assistance in meeting their housing needs. State and local governments depend upon HUD and its system of grants to support community development projects that revive troubled neighborhoods and spark urban renewal. Responding to such a multitude of needs demands an effective management plan that outlines specific strategic goals and provides a yardstick for measuring progress. This Strategic Plan provides the long-term goals and objectives that will guide HUD through FY 2008 and the means by which we will determine our progress. This Plan underscores the commitment I brought to HUD to improve the Department's performance, and to produce these improvements in a manner consistent with the President's Management Agenda and the highest standards of ethics and accountability. Only by continually reassessing its strategic goals can an agency with HUD's size and scope know whether its resources are being properly allocated--and whether the people who depend upon the Department are, in fact, being served.   HUD's mission of service to others is built upon compassion, and yet compassion can be difficult to measure. And so in addition to setting goals and quantifying results, we will continue to ask ourselves the following questions: How many minority families who dreamed the American Dream of homeownership have taken out their first mortgage? How many people experiencing chronic homelessness have taken a step up the ladder of self-sufficiency? How many neighborhoods once cloaked in despair have new hope? How many faith-based and community organizations that had been denied the opportunity to compete for federal funding are today using HUD grants to expand their reach? How many neighborhoods once facing a shortage of affordable housing have homes enough for all? The answers to these questions are the measurements by which we will judge our success as a department guided by compassionate service to others. As the face of HUD and the helping hands that guide those who turn to us for help, our employees are integral to our success. An organization can have the best-planned programs, processes and structures in place, but if it lacks a dedicated, skilled and ethical workforce to carry them out, the work is ultimately meaningless. I am proud of the men and women of HUD and their commitment to our mission. The American Dream is an attainable goal. I know this because I see it achieved every day, so often by families and individuals who never imagined owning their own home or reaching economic self-sufficiency. Through HUD's work in the coming years, our communities and the entire nation will grow even stronger as more families experience the American Dream.

The Strategic Plan describes HUD's newly realigned strategic goals and objectives for the next six years and its plan of action for achieving these objectives and measuring results. It outlines the challenges facing the Department and its programs, and describes its commitment to overcoming these challenges. It highlights the effective working relationships HUD has developed with other federal agencies and branches, and its renewed emphasis on creating partnerships with local governments, faith-based and community organizations and the private sector. It also describes the policies, means and strategies needed to ensure that HUD is a high-performing agency that fulfills its mission to increase homeownership, support community development and increase access to affordable housing free from discrimination. Secretary Martinez has made a commitment to improve HUD's performance and to produce these improvements in a manner that reflects the highest standards of ethics, management and accountability. This is in keeping with President Bush's Management Agenda, which HUD is implementing actively to resolve chronic management weaknesses. This introductory section presents a brief overview of the Strategic Plan and its development. The following section explains in detail the six strategic goals, providing a template for measurement of results. The final section links resources with results, putting forth a vision for how HUD's budget and human capital can best be utilized to achieve its strategic goals. As a reference, the appendix to this Strategic Plan contains greater detail about HUD; its strategic planning and management processes; key statutes that direct its work; and an assessment of major economic, social, demographic or other trends that may impact the direction and success of HUD's efforts. documents reflect HUD's new realigned strategic goals and objectives, and, taken together, they provide substantial information on HUD's long-term objectives and strategies for achieving those objectives. In preparing its new Strategic Plan, the Department obtained stakeholder feedback by meeting with representatives of Congress; consulting with staff of the Office of Management and Budget; and conducting regional stakeholder consultation meetings in Albuquerque, Cincinnati, Providence and Los Angeles and a meeting with national stakeholder groups in Washington, DC. The Department also solicited comments from citizens, stakeholders and HUD employees by publishing a draft of this plan on its Web site. The Department's leadership engaged in extensive deliberations about appropriate strategic goals, objectives and policies. This Strategic Plan reflects HUD's efforts to balance its priorities with input received from stakeholders.  HUD's New Strategic Framework HUD's Strategic Framework consists of a ""mission statement"" supported by strategic goals and objectives that summarize the Department's aims over the next six years. This new strategic framework includes three programmatic strategic goals and three cross-cutting strategic goals. Programmatic goals reflect the program areas where HUD's efforts benefit families and communities. Cross-cutting goals reflect HUD priorities with a wide cross-cutting impact that affect each of HUD's program areas. Under each goal are the key strategic objectives that HUD will use to guide its performance. Mission Statement: Increase homeownership, support community development, and increase access to affordable housing free from discrimination. Programmatic Strategic Goals  Increase homeownership opportunities   Promote decent affordable housing Strengthen communities  Development of this Strategic Plan In 2002, Secretary Mel Martinez tasked HUD leadership with fully assessing HUD's strategic mission, goals and objectives and determining how HUD's work substantively contributes to these aims. All principal areas of HUD contributed to this effort. The Secretary also requested an expedited submission of this Strategic Plan six months prior to the statutory due date, so that the Strategic Plan aligns with the FY 2004 Budget and Annual Performance Plan. These  Cross-cutting Strategic Goals  Ensure equal opportunity in housing   Embrace high standards of ethics, management and accountability Promote participation of faith-based and community organizations  The Department's new framework of strategic goals and objectives is shown in the following table.

Homeownership generates wealth for families and provides stability for children. Homeownership is the American Dream."" -Secretary Mel Martinez  Overview From the early days of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) in the 1930s to the present, Congress and the President have repeatedly charged HUD with opening doors to homeownership for more Americans. Through homeownership, an individual or family makes an investment in the future. A home is an asset that can grow in value and provide capital to finance future needs of a family, such as college educations or retirement. Homeownership helps stabilize neighborhoods, strengthen communities and stimulate economic growth. Holding other factors equal, homeownership improves outcomes for children on a number of dimensions, including school achievement and dropout rates. This strategic goal focuses on HUD's activities to expand homeownership opportunities for minorities, low-income families and other Americans. HUD's activities under this strategic goal will help to make homeownership more accessible and less expensive for millions of families. Six strategic objectives support this goal.  While the overall homeownership rate for 2002 was 67.9 percent, the homeownership rate for lowand moderate-income families was only 52.0 percent. While recognizing that homeownership is not an option for everyone, HUD will focus on ensuring that the benefits of homeownership are made available to more American families.  Objective H2: Increase minority homeownership. The President has charged HUD with creating an unprecedented public/private partnership to eliminate barriers to minority homeownership and add 5.5 million more minority homeowners by 2010. This unique partnership will bring together government, the real estate and mortgage finance industry, affordable housing groups and advocacy organizations on a nationwide campaign to increase homeownership opportunities for minority families. The homeownership rate for minorities in 2002 was 49.2 percent, more than 25 percentage points below the 74.5 percent homeownership rate for nonminority households.  Objective H1: Expand national homeownership opportunities. This objective reflects HUD's goal of helping more families, particularly low- and moderateincome families, attain homeownership. Since its creation in 1934, FHA has insured almost 32 million single-family mortgages totaling $1.6 trillion, and has served as a model for housing finance around the world.  Objective H3: Make the homebuying process less complicated and less expensive. Under this strategic objective, HUD is pursuing major reform of Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) regulations that provide basic consumer protections in the homebuying process. HUD's efforts will require better disclosure of settlement costs, allow consumers more choices, limit excessive settlement fees and HUD Strategic Plan 5   Increase Homeownership Opportunities  encourage innovation and competition in the marketplace. ""At closing, too many American families sit down at the settlement table and discover unexpected fees that can add thousands of dollars to the cost of their loan.... They are not told who is getting their money, or what services they are receiving in return. Because this is thrust upon the buyers at the last moment, they have no opportunity to determine whether these extra costs are at all reasonable."" -Secretary Mel Martinez  Objective H5: Help HUD-assisted renters become homeowners. HUD is committed to helping more HUD-assisted renters become homeowners through expanded use of Housing Choice Vouchers for homeownership. Homeownership vouchers cover the cost of a downpayment or the ongoing costs of a mortgage. Other policies designed to help HUD-assisted renters make progress toward selfsufficiency also contribute to the achievement of this objective.  Objective H6: Keep existing homeowners from losing their homes. It is not enough to help more families become homeowners; HUD is also increasing the focus on assisting new homeowners in maintaining their homeownership status through housing counseling, foreclosure prevention activities and better monitoring of appraisals. In particular, the loss mitigation HUD requires of lenders has proven successful. In FY 2002, of the 73,000 loss mitigations claim payments made by HUD, 69,000 resulted in families being able to remain in their homes.  HUD's efforts are founded upon a set of consumer-driven principles that guide the settlement process. These principles mandate that homebuyers have several rights:  To receive settlement cost information early in the process, allowing them to shop for the mortgage product and settlement services that best meet their needs; To have the disclosed costs be as firm as possible, thereby avoiding surprises at settlement; To benefit from new products, competition and technological innovations that could lower settlement costs; To have access to better borrower education and simplified disclosure; To know they are protected through vigorous RESPA enforcement and a level playing field for all industry providers.      Means and Strategies HUD brings a wide variety of tools to bear on the goal of increasing homeownership opportunities. The overall strategy is to carefully apply publicsector dollars, whether through mortgage insurance, grants, loans, or direct subsidies, to leverage the private market and make it easier for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy and keep their own homes.     Objective H4: Fight practices that permit predatory lending. Recognizing the harm that predatory lending causes to neighborhoods and families---in particular low-income families--this new strategic objective is specifically devoted to eliminating practices that permit predatory lending. HUD is committed to work with other federal and state agencies and to vigorously enforce RESPA. Predatory lending may be undertaken by creditors, brokers, or even home improvement contractors. It involves deception or fraud, manipulating the borrower through aggressive sales tactics, or taking unfair advantage of a borrower's lack of understanding of loan terms.  Increase homeownership opportunities for minorities, HUDassisted renters and other families. Among other efforts to increase homeownership opportunities, HUD plans to:  Provide increased funding for downpayment assistance, thereby addressing one of the principal barriers to homeownership. Increase funding for housing counseling and the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunities Program (SHOP). Housing counseling plays a particularly important role in helping minority families access homeownership. The increase in SHOP funds will help meet the needs of very-low-income families for whom homeownership is only possible through the contribution of sweat equity, the signature characteristic of SHOP.    6  HUD Strategic Plan   Increase Homeownership Opportunities    Expand the use of Housing Choice Vouchers for homeownership. These vouchers can help low-income families purchase homes by covering the ongoing costs of a mortgage or, under recent legislation, by allowing the use of one year's worth of Section 8 assistance for the downpayment on a home. HUD plans to take steps to substantially increase participation in the program, including: publishing a handbook for the Section 8 homeownership program; using incentives through HUD's funding competitions; proposing legislation to eliminate the requirement that the use of Housing Choice Vouchers for downpayment assistance be contingent on advance approval in annual appropriations acts; and exploring strategies to help housing agencies obtain the resources they may need to launch these programs and provide homeownership counseling. Work with the Department of Treasury to enact a tax credit for developers of affordable single-family housing.  million homes, including multifamily units. The total volume of single-family mortgagebacked securities with Ginnie Mae guarantees was $568.4 billion on September 30, 2002.  Programs for Native American communities expand homeownership opportunities for these disadvantaged groups. Through SHOP, HUD engages faith-based and community-based organizations in creating new homeowners. HUD funds housing counseling programs to help its partners break through the noneconomic barriers to homeownership. Among American households, low incomes and distressed central-city locations are strongly associated with minority status. Therefore, HUD programs that focus on lower income groups and distressed communities work effectively to expand homeownership opportunities for minorities. HUD promotes homeownership for minority families and persons with disabilities by enforcing the Fair Housing Act and through special marketing, outreach and education efforts of FHA. The Department will promote the use of FHA's new mortgage scorecard, Technology Open To All Lenders (TOTAL) Scorecard, by mortgage lenders. When used in an automated underwriting system, the scoring system will ensure that mortgage applications are evaluated fairly and uniformly. HUD also regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to ensure that they fulfill their public purposes as mandated by Congress.2 Both GSEs are required to meet three housing goals each year, which are intended to expand affordable housing opportunities for people and communities traditionally underserved by the mortgage markets, including areas with a higher proportion of racial minorities. In addition to serving targeted markets, both GSEs--as well as Ginnie Mae--create liquidity in the mortgage markets to ensure an uninterrupted flow of mortgage funds on a nationwide basis.            In addition, many of HUD's core programs help low- and moderate-income families, including many minority families, to achieve the goal of homeownership.1 For example:  FHA insurance helps first-time homebuyers and other families who could have difficulties obtaining a mortgage. About one million households obtain FHA-insured mortgages in an average year. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program provided $1.7 billion for housing activities, including rental housing, during FY 2002. Grantees used HOME funds to provide critical assistance to an average of 25,604 new homebuyers annually during FYs 19992001 and also assisted existing homeowners. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provided $1.35 billion for housing activities, including rental housing, during FY 2002. Ginnie Mae keeps mortgages affordable by attracting capital into the residential mortgage market. Ginnie Mae's mortgage-backed securities program guaranteed the issuance of $174.9 billion in securities during FY 2002, thereby providing capital to finance the purchase or refinance of approximately 1.5              1  See ""Aligning Resources with Results"" for a comprehensive table of budget and staff resources allocated by program and strategic goal.  2  The financial safety and soundness of the GSEs is regulated by the independent Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.  HUD Strategic Plan  7   Increase Homeownership Opportunities  Keep existing homeowners from losing their homes.  FHA recently implemented its Loss Mitigation Program, under which lenders have more options to help some homeowners keep their homes. In FY 2003, the Department is implementing an accelerated claim disposition demonstration program. Under this demonstration, loans that are almost certain to be foreclosed will be sold to a joint venture partnership that will be managed by a privatesector entity. This entity will decide on the most financially viable option to dispose of and/or restructure the loans, which may allow some families to remain in their homes. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies are available to provide information on services and programs that can help homeowners, with or without FHA insurance, avoid foreclosure. HUD's full implementation of the RESPA rule, discussed above, will foster a better understanding of the home mortgage process, thereby reducing the likelihood of a homeowner entering into a mortgage contract with unfavorable terms and increasing the likelihood that borrowers will be able to maintain their homeownership status.   all costs associated with obtaining a home loan prior to the payment of nonrefundable fees. HUD also is clarifying the rules regarding disclosure of yield spread premiums and removing regulatory barriers to allow the offering of guaranteed mortgage packages.        To address the problem of predatory lending, FHA is building on the results of a predatory lending pilot designed to provide relief to borrowers already in distress and to strengthen FHA endorsement and fraud detection procedures to prevent predatory practices from occurring in the first place. Based in part on the experience with the predatory lending pilot program, FHA plans to take a number of steps to eliminate practices that permit predatory lending. FHA will:  Strengthen licensing and certification requirements for appraisers on the FHA appraiser roster. Strengthen FHA policies and procedures for endorsing single-family mortgages for insurance, including prohibitions on the quick resale known as ""property flipping."" Enhance FHA's ability to identify and discipline perpetrators of fraud and predatory lending practices. Enforce RESPA in coordination with the Fair Housing Act. Ensure field offices implement consistent policy relative to identification and reporting of potentially predatory lending activity, customer response and public education and awareness.           Simplify the homebuying process and counter predatory lending.  To empower homebuyers to shop for the best mortgage and make the best decision for their families, HUD is modifying the RESPA rules to require better, clearer upfront disclosure of  8  HUD Strategic Plan   Increase Homeownership Opportunities  Performance Measures  3  Long-Term Performance Measures HUD will assess its long-term success in achieving this goal by measuring the following outcomes discussed below:  An additional 5.5 million minority households will become homeowners by 2010.  The average closing cost of FHA-insured single-family mortgages will decrease by FY 2006.  The share of FHA-insured home-purchase mortgages for first-time homebuyers remains above 80 percent in each year through 2008.  Between FY 2004 and FY 2008, approximately 400,000 claims will be submitted under the Loss Mitigation Program.  Between FY 2004 and FY 2008, 3.5 million families will receive HUD housing counseling.  Through the Section 601 Accelerated Claims Disposition demonstration, enhance policy objectives, such as savings to the government and homeownership retention.  Implement regulatory changes to combat predatory lending.  Implementation of RESPA regulatory changes will reduce consumer confusion with the mortgage financing process.  Between FY 2004 and FY 2008, 240,000 families will have purchased homes through the HOME Downpayment Assistance Initiative, Housing Choice Homeownership Vouchers, the SelfHelp Opportunities Program and other targeted initiatives.  An additional 5.5 million minority households will become homeowners by 2010. This goal reflects a Presidential commitment to significantly increase minority homeownership. Although homeownership rates can fluctuate yearly due to many external factors, over the long term, they should increase considerably as part of targeted HUD policies and programs. This indicator reflects HUD's expectation that, over the long term, its policies will contribute to an increase in minority homeownership. The national minority homeownership rate rose from 43 percent in March of 1994 to 49.1 percent in March of 2002. This measure projects a similar rate of increase through 2010. Achieving this challenging goal despite the changed economic circumstances will depend on a continued focus of HUD policies and resources on making homeownership opportunities available for minorities and on the significant cooperation of the private sector.  The average closing cost of FHA-insured single-family mortgages will decrease by FY 2006. Reforming RESPA and increasing enforcement will prevent additional closing costs from being added and will increase competition for lending services. As a result, the costs of obtaining a mortgage should decrease. HUD is preparing a closing cost database based on a representative sample of HUD1 forms from loans endorsed by FHA during FY 2001. HUD1 forms, which are required by RESPA for all residential mortgages, list closing costs associated with loans, title insurance, attorneys, settlement agents, taxes, escrow accounts and other payments in the transaction. This database will facilitate statistical analysis of closing costs. The Department will replicate this study in five years (FY 2006), allowing assessment of changes in closing costs. The projected outcome is a reduction in closing costs.  3 Two sets of performance indicators are specified for each strategic goal. The first set of measurements, discussed in the main text, reflects the projected long-term outcomes of the policies employed to achieve the goal. The second set of measurements, listed in the text boxes titled ""Intermediate Measures Supporting this Goal,"" reflects shorter term results that HUD plans to track closely over the next year or two to determine if progress is being made in achieving the goal. Both sets of measures will be included in the Annual Performance Plan.  HUD Strategic Plan  9   Increase Homeownership Opportunities  The share of FHA-insured home-purchase mortgages for first-time homebuyers remains above 80 percent in each year through 2008. FHA is a major source of mortgage financing for firsttime buyers as well as for minority and lower income buyers. HUD supports the overall homeownership rate through FHA endorsements for first-time homebuyers. This performance measure tracks the share of first-time homebuyers among FHA endorsements for home purchases--thus excluding refinanced loans made for home improvements or other reasons. This performance goal of 80 percent is HUD's benchmark that reflects the continued high performance achieved since FY 1998.  Through the Section 601 Accelerated Claims Disposition (ACD) demonstration, enhance policy objectives, such as savings to the government and homeownership retention. Under authority from Section 601 of the National Housing Act in 1999, HUD has implemented a demonstration program to reform the single-family claims and property disposition process and maximize recoveries on claims paid. Under the demonstration, FHA takes assignment of notes and transfers them to private parties for servicing, foreclosure avoidance, property management and asset disposition. FHA utilizes a structured financing, retaining an equity interest in the property, but will not take ownership of property. HUD aims to shorten the time in which servicers can file a claim for default, address defaults by aligning private sector interests with HUD's objectives, reduce its real estate owned (REO) portfolio and increase the value of single-family assets and recovery to FHA. In addition, delinquent borrowers with mortgages included in the sale will have a greater range of options to remain in their homes. To the extent possible, this public/private partnership will help borrowers retain homeownership by reinstating or restructuring existing loans and then packaging them for resale. In FY 2003, FHA will conduct an evaluation of the ACD demonstration to determine, among other things, the extent to which it enhances HUD's ability to achieve policy objectives, such as savings to the government and homeownership retention.  Between FY 2004 and FY 2008, approximately 400,000 claims will be submitted under the Loss Mitigation Program. This measure tracks the success of FHA loan servicers in implementing statutorily required loss-mitigation techniques when borrowers default on their FHA mortgages. A borrower can resolve a default (90-day delinquency) in several ways short of foreclosure: by paying down the delinquency (cure), by a pre-foreclosure sale with FHA perhaps paying an insurance claim in the amount of the shortfall, or by surrendering a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Better loss-mitigation efforts, such as enhanced borrower counseling, help borrowers keep their current homes or permit them to buy another home sooner. Avoidance of foreclosure also reduces FHA's insurance losses, making FHA financially more sound and enabling it to help more borrowers. For both reasons, by achieving this goal HUD will help increase the overall homeownership rate.  Implement regulatory changes to combat predatory lending.  Between FY 2004 and FY 2008, 3.5 million families will receive HUD housing counseling. The Department is placing more emphasis on housing counseling, and counseling is a requirement for several programs such as Section 8 homeownership. An increase in housing counseling funding in FY 2003 will not only increase the number of homebuyers and homeowners counseled but also allow the Department to provide technical assistance to improve the capacity of its housing counseling agencies. Those counseled include homebuyers, homeowners, homeless clients and families seeking affordable rental housing. In particular, new counseling resources will help more members of minority and other underserved groups to build the knowledge to become homeowners and to sustain their new tenure by meeting the ongoing responsibilities of homeownership. 10  HUD will publish in FY 2003 regulations to help reduce predatory lending, including a rule that prohibits quick resales, or ""flipping,"" of FHA-insured properties. Other rules will govern lender accountability for appraisals, limitations on nonprofit participation, revisions to Credit Watch, changes to the Section 203(k) rehabilitation loan insurance program, lender compliance and accountability enhancements, duties and responsibilities of loan correspondents and sponsors and appraiser qualifications. HUD will continue to review and analyze the long-term impact of these strengthened regulations. Once implemented, the impact of these rules is expected to grow over time.  Implementation of RESPA regulatory changes will reduce consumer confusion with the mortgage financing process. The complexity of the mortgage process and the confusion it causes among borrowers places an enormous burden on families shopping for mortgage loans. The proposed RESPA regulation addresses the need for more consumer understanding of the mortgage process, simpler  HUD Strategic Plan   Increase Homeownership Opportunities  disclosures at the shopping stage and more reliable estimates of settlement costs. A study will be undertaken in 2006 to analyze the extent to which consumer confusion is still a problem and indicate whether further action is needed.  Between FY 2004 and FY 2008, 240,000 families will have purchased homes through the HOME Downpayment Assistance Initiative, Housing Choice Homeownership Vouchers, the Self-Help Opportunities Homeownership Program and other targeted initiatives. This measure tracks the number of homeowners assisted with Housing Choice Homeownership Vouchers, the  HOME Downpayment Assistance Initiative, SHOP and other homeownership funds. Over five years, HUD expects to assist 200,000 new homeowners through the HOME Downpayment Initiative, 26,000 new homeowners through SHOP and 12,000 new homeowners with Housing Choice Homeownership Vouchers. These projections assume funding levels equivalent to those in the Administration's FY 2003 budget request.  Intermediate Measures Supporting this Goal  By the end of FY 2003, FHA will: o prevent the issuance of FHA mortgage insurance on properties that have been transferred within three months. o publish regulations for FHA mortgage insurance programs that increase lender compliance and accountability, codify the responsibilities of loan correspondents and sponsors and strengthen appraiser qualifications. o publish regulations designed to reduce defaults by limiting nonprofit participation in FHA programs and strengthening the Section 203(k) rehabilitation loan program. Beginning in the third quarter of FY 2003, field offices will report a consolidated listing of all activities related to predatory lending to HQ through the regional directors on a quarterly basis. Eighty percent of FHA-endorsed home-purchase mortgages each year will be for first-time homebuyers. In FY 2003, 78,000 claims will be submitted under the Loss Mitigation Program. In FY 2004, 700,000 families will receive housing counseling. In FY 2003, FHA will conduct an evaluation of the Accelerated Claims Disposition demonstration. The number of minority households assisted in becoming homeowners through the HOME program increases. National and regional economic conditions have a strong impact on the homeownership rate and on several performance measures related to HUD homeownership programs. State and local grantees under the CDBG program have discretion about whether to use funds for homeownership, rental housing, or other community and economic development activities. In some cases, economic growth supported by community development activities results in higher, unaffordable housing costs. Historical patterns of discrimination and differences in schooling and income levels make it more difficult for minorities to secure the income and credit history needed to become homeowners.  With respect to predatory lending, a variety of state and federal authorities regulate home mortgage lending, and none have a formal definition of predatory lending. Therefore it is difficult to quantify the scope of predatory lending practices, whether market-wide or specific to FHA. The impacts of HUD efforts may be limited by structural, economic and social influences on neighborhood housing markets. These include the lack of financial sophistication of disadvantaged households, language barriers to understanding the intricacies of the American real estate finance and lending markets and the numerous actors and inherent complexity of the home purchase and mortgage processes.         External Factors          HUD Strategic Plan  11   12  HUD Strategic Plan   Strategic Goal  Promote Decent Affordable Housing ""We will measure success by the number of Americans who have moved out of assisted housing and are climbing the ladder of self-sufficiency. At the same time, we acknowledge that HUD provides a vital safety net for many in society; we take this obligation seriously, and will continue to fulfill it."" -Secretary Mel Martinez  Overview Promoting decent affordable housing is a central part of HUD's mission. To this end, HUD seeks to expand access to affordable rental housing, improve the physical quality and management accountability of public and assisted housing, increase housing opportunities for the elderly and persons with disabilities and help HUDassisted renters make progress toward self-sufficiency. Success in achieving the goal of promoting decent affordable housing will require the cooperation, support and initiative of local communities. Clearly, the federal government has a role in helping to address the challenges of housing affordability in America. The government provides tax credits to stimulate rental housing construction and rehabilitation, block grants that can be used for housing production, rental assistance to low-income citizens and insurance and guarantee programs. But success in meeting the nation's affordable housing needs cannot be achieved without devolving decision-making authority to the state and local level. No one is in a better position to address a community's specific affordable housing concerns than the community leaders themselves. and through the HOME program provides states and localities with flexible funding they can use to produce affordable rental housing. Within the constraints of its budget, HUD seeks to provide affordable housing opportunities to as many families as possible. HUD also will work to develop creative solutions to the problems presented by local regulatory barriers and other obstacles to the development of affordable rental housing.  Objective A2: Improve the physical quality and management accountability of public and assisted housing. HUD is committed to improving the quality of HUDassisted housing and ensuring that all subsidized families live in units that meet basic quality standards. Through the use of management tools that track the housing quality of public and assisted housing, the Department will continue to work with its partners toward meeting this objective. The Department also plans to focus on improving the management accountability of public and assisted housing. Public and assisted housing programs have suffered from a number of serious management weaknesses, including: the lack of a comprehensive evaluation system; the failure to accurately calculate tenant incomes and rents, leading to subsidy overpayments; the failure to maintain subsidized developments in adequate condition; and, in extreme cases, severe mismanagement or even fraud. As part of the effort to preserve affordable housing through the Mark-to-Market program, HUD sets  Objective A1: Expand access to affordable rental housing. To help low-income families afford the costs of rental housing, HUD provides rental assistance to more than four million households through public and assisted housing programs. HUD also funds a number of rental assistance programs geared to special populations, such as the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program and homeless assistance programs,  HUD Strategic Plan  13   Promote Decent Affordable Housing  appropriate market-level rents for HUD-assisted housing--thereby eliminating subsidy overpayments-- and incorporates policies and procedures to ensure good management and good physical condition at properties that have gone through the program.  Means and Strategies Expand access to affordable rental housing.  HUD has three major rental assistance programs that collectively provide rental subsidies to more than four million households nationwide: the Housing Choice Voucher program (also known as Section 8 voucher program), the project-based Section 8 program and public housing. A substantial share of HUD's budget is devoted to renewals of Housing Choice Voucher and project-based Section 8 contracts, as well as the operating and capital funds that support public housing. In addition, the Office of Housing continues to preserve affordable housing through the Mark-to-Market and Mark-Upto-Market programs. A number of HUD's programs and initiatives help to annually increase the number of families that obtain access to affordable rental housing. These programs include: o o Incremental housing vouchers, The HOME Investment Partnerships program; since 1992, participating jurisdictions have spent more than 55 percent of HOME on rental housing, The Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) program, The Supportive Housing for the Disabled (Section 811) program, The HOPWA program, The Native American Housing Block Grant program, The CDBG program and FHA multifamily insurance.  Objective A3: Increase housing opportunities for the elderly and persons with disabilities. Elderly households and persons with disabilities have special needs that require flexible housing strategies. HUD's strategies supporting this objective are intended to maximize the independence of these households. These strategies should focus on promoting communitybased living opportunities for the elderly and persons with disabilities where appropriate and making supportive services available to residents of rental housing, enabling them to live as independently as possible in the most integrated setting. One way HUD supports independence for persons with disabilities is to promote visitability in all HUD-funded projects. HUD's Section 202 and 811 programs for elderly households and persons with disabilities are unique among HUD programs in providing the only construction financing program for affordable supportive rental housing for the target populations.    Objective A4: Help HUD-assisted renters make progress toward self-sufficiency. This objective, together with Objective H5, ""Help HUD-assisted renters become homeowners,"" reflects the Department's intention to maximize public and assisted housing's role as a springboard that helps low-income families progress toward self-sufficiency and homeownership. Efforts to promote self-sufficiency among residents of public and assisted housing serve four core objectives:  By helping increase the capacity for family earnings, improving the quality of life for families in subsidized housing; Assisting families in subsidized housing to acquire sufficient assets and incomes high enough to buy a home; By helping families in subsidized housing to become homeowners or afford the costs of unsubsidized rental housing, freeing up space for other needy families; Helping to achieve a mix of incomes in public housing and project-based assisted housing.   o o o o o o      In addition to the programs administered by HUD, other federal programs play a significant role in expanding access to affordable rental housing. These include the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and tax-exempt bonds--both of which were significantly expanded in recent years--as well as programs of the Rural Housing Service at the Department of Agriculture.  To further expand the number of residents that benefit from the existing supply of subsidized rental housing, HUD will work to:  Expand the number of households that receive HUD rental assistance by improving the utilization of Housing Choice Vouchers (see below for specific steps);    14  HUD Strategic Plan   Promote Decent Affordable Housing    Make it easier for families to successfully use Housing Choice Vouchers. Among other recentlyadopted policies, HUD has taken steps to improve the accuracy of Fair Market Rents (FMRs) by increasing funding for the rent surveys used to calculate FMRs; allowing housing authorities experiencing difficulties using vouchers to adopt a higher 50th percentile FMR; publishing a Housing Choice Voucher handbook to help local housing authorities improve their programs; and implementing the Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) that gives incentives to public housing authorities (PHAs) to improve the performance of their voucher programs; Improve the utilization of public housing capital funds by local PHAs that have large amounts of unobligated and unspent capital funds; Revitalize and transform public housing projects to retain them as affordable housing in decent neighborhoods.  refinancing to recapitalize a property for rehabilitation or other purposes.  HUD will ensure that, as a result of changes in the stock of public and assisted housing, all eligible lowincome tenants are protected from increases in rents and all project-based units lost are replaced with housing vouchers or new units.  Finally, HUD plans to continue its efforts to expand families' access to affordable private-market housing through activities such as:    Multifamily mortgage insurance. Research that seeks to reduce the construction and operating costs of housing. The maintenance of a regulatory barriers clearinghouse for sharing information on how to address local regulatory barriers to the development of affordable housing.      HUD also will work to ensure that the stock of assisted housing is not diminished as a result of opt-outs, prepayments and other changes in the housing stock, and that the extent to which these events adversely affect tenants is minimized. In particular, the expiration of long-term Section 8 project rental subsidies (Housing Assistance Payments or HAP contracts) can leave properties vulnerable to being removed from the nation's stock of affordable housing. HUD will continue the following affordable housing preservation activities:  Subject to the availability of appropriations, HUD will offer to renew HAP contracts on all subsidized units that meet housing quality standards. The Mark-to-Market program's alignment of owner incentives will continue to preserve the privately owned HUD-assisted affordable housing stock. To maintain the supply of affordable housing that already exists, HUD will increase rents in certain areas through the Mark-Up-to-Market program to preserve assisted multifamily units where an owner might otherwise opt out of a housing assistance contract. In some cases, HUD will execute and enforce use agreements as part of the sale of HUD-owned property and/or as a condition of prepayment of FHA multifamily insurance. HUD will use other available incentives to encourage owners of multifamily assisted rental housing to maintain affordability. These incentives can include increased distributions, increased rents to facilitate a transfer to a nonprofit and structured  Improving physical conditions and management accountability. Improving the performance of housing intermediaries in meeting HUD's physical standards for public and multifamily housing is a high priority for this administration and was, therefore, included in the President's Management Agenda (PMA) for HUD. In 2000, only 70 percent of public housing units and 85 percent of privately owned, multifamily assisted housing met these standards. In the PMA, HUD set 2005 goals of 84 percent for public housing and 92 percent for multifamily assisted housing. In February 2002, public housing units met the 2005 standard, well before the original target date. As a result, a new goal was established, and HUD expects to raise the proportion of all public and assisted units meeting HUD's physical standards to 92 percent by 2005. The Department has several current tools and is developing others to improve the physical quality and management accountability of public and assisted housing. HUD plans to:  Continue to monitor privately assisted multifamily housing through Section 8 contract administrators who perform management and occupancy reviews, and through physical inspections on 100 percent of their portfolios. More fully develop the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) so that it will assess multiple dimensions of public housing management and conditions, and identify PHAs that are troubled in order to improve their operations. Fully implement and improve the SEMAP, used to objectively measure PHA performance related to HUD Strategic Plan 15               Promote Decent Affordable Housing  their Housing Choice Voucher programs, and identify troubled agencies for remedial measures.  Use the Mark-to-Market program to ensure that the management of HUD-assisted, privately-owned housing meets its operating obligations, resulting in the ongoing maintenance of proper physical standards at these properties. To date, repairs and rehabilitation of over 45,000 units have been accomplished with over $60 million in repair escrows funded through the Mark-to-Market program. HUD estimates an increase of $100 million in repair escrow funds through the life of the Mark-to-Market program. Additionally, significant increases in reserve for replacement account deposits and 30-year use agreements will ensure the maintenance of this resource. Use data from the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) on the financial soundness of providers of assisted multifamily housing, physical quality of the stock, and satisfaction of the residents to refer substandard properties to the Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC). The DEC is responsible for working with multifamily properties that have been identified as substandard in one or more areas by REAC. For some noncompliant multifamily development owners, the DEC makes civil referrals to the Department of Justice or criminal referrals to HUD's Inspector General. HUD has recently instituted a system of referrals to the DEC for multifamily properties with REAC scores between 30 and 60. For those properties, HUD will require repairs to be completed within 60 days. If property conditions do not meet HUD requirements, HUD will force compliance or take appropriate enforcement action. Require assessments of lead-based paint risk for all pre-1960 multifamily housing that receives over $5,000 per unit in project-based Section 8 assistance, and complete lead hazard assessments by the end of FY 2003 for assisted multifamily housing constructed between 1960 and 1977.    Assess opportunities to simplify current laws and regulations regarding income and rent determinations to improve program compliance; Expand local efforts to match income data against state records.    Several means were employed, beginning in FY 2002, to improve the utilization of Housing Choice Vouchers by PHAs:    Give substantial weight to utilization rates in determining PHAs' ratings under SEMAP; Allocate new incremental vouchers to PHAs with utilization rates above 97 percent; Implement a new tracking system to measure current utilization rates, so that underutilizers can be identified earlier and corrective actions taken; and Provide remediation services to PHAs with troubled Section 8 programs, which generally have low rates of Section 8 utilization.      HUD also will provide resources to PHAs to improve their conditions and protect the nation's investment in the public housing stock. HUD plans to:  Ensure effective and timely use of the Public Housing Capital Fund, which provides formula grants to PHAs to address new modernization requirements and reduce the backlog of rehabilitation and modernization requirements. Establish a new Capital Financing Program to attract private capital to address the backlog in public housing capital improvement needs and put public housing developments on sound financial footing in the future by focusing on property-based planning and management. Authorization for the program was requested as part of the FY 2003 budget request. Support the completion of HOPE VI projects, which fund the demolition and revitalization of severely distressed public housing. Changes have been made to ensure project readiness and timely use of funds that will speed up the production of units.        HUD is implementing the Rental Housing Integrity Improvement Project (RHIIP) to reduce error in income and rent determinations. RHIIP comprises a number of efforts:  Develop tools to assist housing agencies and assisted housing owners in the determination of income and calculation of rent; Introduce a quality control program to monitor the performance of housing intermediaries;  Increase housing options for the elderly. HUD is implementing a number of new policies designed to assist the elderly. These policies, which were authorized in the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 and the FY 2001 VA-HUD Appropriations Act, will:  Expand eligibility for the Assisted Living Conversion Program to include not only Section    16  HUD Strategic Plan   Promote Decent Affordable Housing  202 projects but all HUD multifamily projects with project-based Section 8 and with Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) insurance.  Allow nonprofit sponsors of Section 202 developments to form limited partnerships with forprofit entities to compete for low-income housing tax credits and give sponsors greater discretion in how funds are used to meet the needs of the elderly. Make prepayment and refinancing of Section 202 projects more attractive to owners, and ensure that at least 50 percent of the annual savings are used in a manner that directly benefits the residents. Encourage service coordinators to assist low-income elderly families living near, as well as those residing in, multifamily assisted housing designated for the elderly and people with disabilities.  26 projects predating 1997 that have not reached initial closing. This represents only 1.3 percent of the 2,058 projects that were funded during that timeframe. Funds recaptured from these cancelled projects are available and used for new grants.  Increase housing opportunities for persons with disabilities. President Bush launched the New Freedom Initiative in 2001, with an executive order charging HUD and five other federal agencies to improve access to services and opportunities for community integration of persons with disabilities. HUD has several key initiatives to implement the President's order:  Revising HUD's Section 8 rent subsidy program to permit people with disabilities to use vouchers to make mortgage payments to purchase their own homes. Implementing a pilot program in 11 states called Project Access, a joint effort between HUD and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), designed to ease the transition of nonelderly persons with disabilities from nursing homes into community living. Expanding rental choices and ensuring that housing vouchers are being used effectively by offering technical assistance to PHAs and nonprofit organizations having difficulty in utilizing housing vouchers. Preference is given in the awarding of general-purpose vouchers to housing authorities that agree to use a specified percentage for persons with disabilities. Signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service to ensure that multifamily properties within the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, the number-one producer of low-income housing, comply with federal accessibility standards.      In addition to implementing these new provisions, HUD will continue to use core programs to help low-income seniors obtain suitable and affordable living environments that support independence:  Provide mortgage insurance to finance the construction and rehabilitation of assisted living facilities through the Section 232 program. Permit housing rental vouchers to be used for the housing costs in assisted living facilities. Provide affordable housing and rental subsidies for older renters through Section 202, and convert elderly housing to assisted living or creating new assisted living facilities. Provide Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), or ""reverse"" mortgages, to allow senior homeowners to convert accumulated equity in their homes to income in the form of monthly payments, a lump sum or a line of credit. HECMs can help elderly homeowners adapt their homes to accommodate changing physical needs, or simply pay medical and living expenses to maintain their quality of life. Through HUD's public housing and Section 8 programs, provide substantial numbers of affordable housing units for elderly households. More closely monitor the use of Section 202/811 grant funds. The Section 202 and 811 programs are unique in providing the only construction-financing programs for affordable supportive rental housing. Through close monitoring, the Department has substantially reduced the number of grants outstanding where there was no evidence of progress. Less than two years ago, there were more than 100 of these projects in the development pipeline. As of the end of FY 2002, there are only               In addition, HUD is continuing to vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act and other federal laws prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities.  Through voluntary compliance agreements between HUD and the housing authorities in the District of Columbia and Boston, an additional 1,200 fully accessible housing units will become available in those cities. In FY 2003, HUD will award more than $16 million in Fair Housing grants to fund organizations leading the fight against housing discrimination. HUD recently entered into an historic partnership with the National Association of Home Builders        HUD Strategic Plan  17   Promote Decent Affordable Housing  aimed at ensuring that multifamily housing complies with the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements.  HUD has launched two major education and outreach initiatives to make certain that more apartments and condominiums are built to be accessible to people with disabilities. HUD's Shelter Plus Care program provides $100 million a year in grants to help provide rental assistance and supportive services to homeless individuals living with disabilities.  HUD plans to work to significantly expand participation in the FSS program by:   Reaching out and providing technical assistance to housing agencies; Using the performance measures of the SEMAP to support incentives for active FSS participation for housing agencies in HUD's funding competitions; Examining program rules to determine if additional changes are needed to increase participation.      Promote self-sufficiency. The Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program is HUD's primary tool for helping families in the Housing Choice Voucher and public housing programs build assets and increase their incomes.  To help families achieve their goals, FSS families work with a service coordinator who provides referrals for appropriate supportive services in the community such as childcare, transportation, education, or job training. FSS has an escrow component that helps families build savings. As a family's earnings increases, an amount equal to the increase in the family's rent is deposited in an escrow account that they can use to purchase a home, obtain higher education, or achieve other personal goals.  A number of additional programs help families in public and assisted housing make progress toward selfsufficiency. These include:  Continuing to support the creation of Neighborhood Networks centers and other computer centers in assisted multifamily housing developments. These multiservice community technology centers help low- and moderate-income residents gain knowledge and skills through the use of computer learning to prepare themselves for the job market and attain self-sufficiency. Expanding enforcement of Section 3 of the HUD Act of 1968, which ensures that HUD-funded construction, rehabilitation, or other public construction expands employment and training opportunities for low-income residents. HUD will further ensure that contract opportunities are awarded to Section 3 Business Concerns for all nonexempt contracts. The Department will focus on education and outreach to its internal and external clients.      18  HUD Strategic Plan   Promote Decent Affordable Housing  Performance Measures Long-Term Performance Measures HUD will assess its long-term success in achieving this goal by measuring the following outcomes discussed below:      Improve the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS). The average SEMAP score increases. Among households living in assisted multifamily properties, the share living in developments that have substandard financial management decreases by 2.5 percent per year. The utilization rate of Housing Choice Vouchers increases to 98 percent by 2006 and stays above 98 percent through 2008. By FY 2008, increase the proportion of those entering HUD's housing assistance programs who ""graduate"" from assistance within five years (or receive continuing assistance as homeowners) because their income is sufficient to pay for adequate housing. Increase the amounts of leveraged private capital in public housing. Increase the timely performance of HOPE VI grants. Continue to enhance the quality of life of the elderly and persons with disabilities through developments funded under Sections 202 and 811 that meet their physical needs and provide supportive services. Between FY 2004 and FY 2008, over 1.2 million households will receive housing assistance with CDBG, HOME, HOPWA and Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBG).        Improve the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS). In FY 2003, an improved and simplified assessment system will enable HUD to enhance the livability, management, accountability and resident satisfaction of the nation's public housing system. The new PHAS will track HUD's progress toward increasing the capability and accountability of PHA partners. HUD will, for the first time, perform extensive quality reviews of 350 housing agencies on an annual basis to ensure that PHAs are accurately certifying their management performance. HUD will also continue to step up its efforts to identify and root out poor performing audit firms that audit PHAs. As measured through the new PHAS, HUD expects PHA scores to increase through FY 2008.  Choice Voucher program. SEMAP tracks housing agency performance on a broad range of indicators of program administration, including voucher utilization, compliance with housing quality standards and correct calculation of rental subsidy.  Among households living in assisted multifamily properties, the share living in developments that have substandard financial management decreases by 2.5 percent per year. The REAC evaluates the financial management of privately owned multifamily properties based on generally accepted accounting principles. The REAC Financial Assessment Subsystem involves Internet-based submission of audited financial information in a standardized format. Data are validated, reviewed and scored, resulting in standard and substandard designations. Multifamily financial scores are determined at the project level for every subsidized development-- meaning properties that have Section 8 contracts, HUD Strategic Plan 19  The average SEMAP score increases. The SEMAP was fully implemented in 2002. SEMAP provides HUD with an essential tool for measuring the quality of housing agency administration of the Housing   Promote Decent Affordable Housing  outstanding mortgages with interest subsidies, or both-- and are household-weighted to focus attention on the greatest problems nationally. For the reporting period in 2001, the share of households living in subsidized multifamily properties that had substandard financial management was 29.5 percent.  Increase the amounts of leveraged private capital in public housing. By 2008, HUD will increase the amount of leveraged private-sector financing by over three times the amount leveraged in FY 2001. This leveraging promises to improve physical conditions for public housing residents by increasing the amount of capital improvements to a level that is considerably greater than that supported by Public Housing Capital Fund appropriations. This leveraging will increase the livability and sustainability, as well as greatly help to preserve the nation's supply of affordable housing. By FY 2008, HUD will be attracting at least $150 million of private capital for public housing on an annual basis.  The utilization rate of Housing Choice Vouchers increases to 98 percent by 2006 and stays above 98 percent through 2008. The Housing Choice Voucher program is one of HUD's best tools for providing affordable housing to renters with very low or extremely low incomes, including those with worst case housing needs. While most Housing Choice Vouchers are currently being used to assist lowincome families, some PHAs are not fully utilizing all allocated funds and vouchers, reducing the number of vouchers available to help families. For 2001, the national lease-up rate for units was 89.6 percent, and the funding utilization was 91.3 percent. This indicator reflects HUD's expectation that its policies will substantially increase the utilization of Housing Choice Vouchers such that, by 2006, the rates for both funding and units reach 98 percent.  Increase the timely performance of HOPE VI grants. By 2008, HUD will ensure that 100 percent of all HOPE VI affordable housing units funded through FY 2001 will be built. The Department is more closely monitoring the performance of existing HOPE VI grantees. Program reforms geared toward tracking projects, streamlining processing, monitoring and assisting housing authorities and ensuring completion of the existing projects will result in the replacement of severely distressed public housing projects with mixed-income, mixed-finance developments in revitalized neighborhoods. This policy affects 68,700 affordable housing units.  By FY 2008, increase the proportion of those entering HUD's housing assistance programs who ""graduate"" from assistance within five years (or receive continuing assistance as homeowners) because their income is sufficient to pay for adequate housing. A key role of HUD's public and assisted housing programs is to provide low-income families with housing stability that can help them make progress to selfsufficiency. In FY 2004, HUD will establish the baseline proportion of those families who have been assisted for fewer than five years that are leaving federally assisted housing because they can afford adequate housing on their own. This will include determining the duration of tenancy and changes in their employment, and homeownership since they first received housing assistance. In FY 2008, HUD will determine whether a later sample group of entrants into housing assistance fared better with regard to achieving self-sufficiency than the initial group. Success in this measure will also allow HUD to serve more people with housing assistance needs. This performance measure excludes the elderly persons HUD serves but includes disabled persons who can work.  Continue to enhance the quality of life of the elderly and persons with disabilities through developments funded under Sections 202 and 811 that meet their physical needs and provide supportive services. HUD's Section 202 and 811 programs for elderly households and persons with disabilities provide construction financing for affordable supportive rental housing for target populations. These properties can enhance the resident's quality of life by providing physical improvements such as wheelchair accessibility and grab-bars and services that support their daily activities. In its survey of residents of multifamily properties, HUD will include a subset of questions specially designed to measure how well these programs are meeting the physical and supportive service needs of the elderly and persons with disabilities. The results of this survey will be used to analyze the benefits of Section 202/811 housing.  20  HUD Strategic Plan   Promote Decent Affordable Housing  Between FY 2004 and FY 2008, over 1.2 million households will receive housing assistance with CDBG, HOME, HOPWA and NAHBG. Because of shortages of affordable housing and the need to maintain existing housing units, it is desirable to increase the number of households aided with housing  assistance, including rental housing production. The level of these housing outputs is subject to appropriations as well as economic conditions and local discretion. Grantees use their discretion to decide what types of housing assistance to provide with HOME and NAHBG funds. In the case of CDBG and HOPWA funds, housing assistance is one of several eligible activities from which grantees may choose.  Intermediate Measures Supporting this Goal The Department will track:  The number of households who have accumulated assets through the FSS program, and the average escrow amount of FSS graduates.  The share of households living in FHA multifamily developments that have substandard financial management.  The average PHAS score.  The average SEMAP score.  The utilization of Housing Choice Vouchers.  The percentage of HOME project funds and number of units of rental production.  The number of households receiving housing assistance with CDBG, HOME, HOPWA, and NAHBG. In addition:  In FY 2004, HUD will establish the baseline proportion of those families who have been assisted for fewer than five years that graduate from HUD assistance because they can afford adequate housing on their own. For FY 2003, Section 202/811 tenants will continue to have an overall satisfaction rate above 80 percent. During FY 2004, Section 202/811 tenant satisfaction rates shall be compared to similar survey data for the low-income elderly as reported in the American Housing Survey. In FY 2003, all Section 202/811 projects initially funded in FY 1997 and earlier, with the exception of projects that are the subject of litigation, shall go to initial closing or be cancelled. Use FY 2002 results, based on projects funded in FY 2000, to provide a baseline for improving the timely completion of Section 202/ 811 projects. For FY 2004, close 75 percent of projects funded in FY 2002 within 24 months of funding. By the end of FY 2003, 95 percent of the active inventory of substandard assisted multifamily properties inspected are repaired or are subjected to the appropriate enforcement action. The share of HUD-assisted multifamily properties observed with exigent health and safety or fire safety deficiencies decreases by 0.6 percent by the end of FY 2003. In 2005, the share of public and assisted housing units that meet HUD's physical standards will exceed 92 percent.           HUD Strategic Plan  21   Promote Decent Affordable Housing  External Factors Many external factors affect the supply of affordable rental housing for low-income families and for the elderly and persons with disabilities. These include local rental markets, building codes and land use regulations, state and local program decisions and the actions of HUD's many other partners. The continued growth in the number of elderly persons, fueled in part by the  baby-boom generation, will continue to challenge those working to ensure access to diverse housing opportunities for this population. Finally, broad economic factors that affect opportunities for low-income workers will directly affect HUD's ability to assist HUD-assisted renters as they make progress toward self-sufficiency.  22  HUD Strategic Plan   Strategic Goal  Strengthen Communities ""Communities flourish when they have the freedom to put local solutions to work solving local problems. HUD has its most positive impact on the local level when we empower communities--through new tools and resources--to chart their own destinies."" -Secretary Mel Martinez  Overview Through the programs of HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD), HUD supports the community and economic development efforts of states, local communities and other HUD partners. For nearly 30 years, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds have built and rehabilitated homes, fueled business development to create jobs and improved the overall health of our nation's communities. Instead of trying to impose a one-size-fits-all program on every locality, CDBG-funded programs are designed by each community to best meet unique local needs. Additionally, the HOME program helps strengthen communities by expanding the availability of homeownership and affordable rental housing. CPD also is responsible for administering HUD's homeless programs, which are an essential component of the Administration's bold strategy for eliminating chronic homelessness in ten years. Other HUD Offices contribute to this goal through maintaining and promoting quality affordable housing in neighborhoods, reaching out to communities through University Partnerships and fostering international exchanges on housing, community development and urban planning. This strategic goal has four objectives: well as education, training and services that strengthen the workforce. Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of l968 requires that, to the greatest extent feasible, HUD will ensure that jobs, training and contracts are given to low- and very-low-income persons residing in the economic distressed areas where federal financial assistance is provided to HUD's recipient agencies.  Objective C2: Help organizations access the resources they need to make their communities more livable. Helping communities become more ""livable"" means addressing quality-of-life issues as well as economic factors. Livability reflects the positive impacts of public services and improvements that result from funds spent to revitalize poor neighborhoods, along with intangible benefits such as community volunteerism. Many communities use HUD resources for projects designed to improve livability. For example, CDBG funds are used for roads, sewers and other infrastructure investments, or for community centers, parks and other assets that help to strengthen and revitalize low-income communities. HUD also funds housing development and rehabilitation through CDBG, HOME, Youthbuild and Lead Hazard Control grants.  Objective C1: Provide capital and resources to improve economic conditions in distressed communities. A key objective of HUD's community and economic development programs is to help improve economic conditions in distressed communities. Economic development is a key activity under the CDBG program. Funded activities include job creation and retention, as  Objective C3: End chronic homelessness and move homeless families and individuals to permanent housing. HUD is committed to ending chronic homelessness within ten years--by 2011. HUD's working definition of a person experiencing chronic homelessness is an unaccompanied individual with a disabling condition HUD Strategic Plan 23   Strengthen Communities  who has been continuously homeless for a year or more or has had recurring episodes of homelessness. Even when housing is available, their disabilities sometimes make it difficult for them to remain in that housing for long periods unless they also have supportive services including case management and regular health care. Although there are no reliable counts, the Millennial Housing Commission Report ""Meeting Our Nation's Housing Challenges"" estimates the number of persons experiencing chronic homelessness to be between 150,000 and 200,000. ""For too many years, Washington waited until a person became homeless before taking action. Today we come together to commit the combined resources of the federal government as we move beyond managing homelessness toward a more holistic approach, including a greater emphasis on preventing individuals from becoming homeless in the first place."" -Secretary Mel Martinez, July 2002 Meeting of the Interagency Council for the Homeless  addresses hazards in unassisted private housing. The Department is committed to eliminating the poisoning of children by lead-based paint in older homes. Along with the Environmental Protection Agency, HUD regulates the disclosure of lead paint when homes are rented or sold. HUD provides financial resources for communities to address their own lead paint hazards through the Lead Hazard Control Grant program. HUD's Healthy Homes program conducts research, demonstrations, and public education on how other housing conditions are related to other preventable children's diseases and injuries, such as asthma and carbon monoxide poisoning. The CDBG program also provides resources to communities for a wide range of community development and housing activities, including for lead hazard control separately or as part of housing rehabilitation, counseling and health services. Through innovative research, HUD is also advancing the safety of the nation's housing. In addition to the evaluation of lead hazard reduction programs, HUD supports research and development of housing construction that resists natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornados and firestorms. In addition, for persons with HIV and other chronic health challenges, the risks of homelessness pose a direct threat to their health, stability and relative wellness. The Department's homeless assistance programs and the HOPWA program are vital tools in reducing the health consequences for persons who are homeless or at severe risk of homelessness.  While those experiencing chronic homelessness are often the most visible of the homeless population, there is also a substantial problem of families and individuals who experience a more temporary crisis, such as loss of employment or eviction, and become homeless. HUD will forge a three-pronged attack that will focus on:   The prevention of homelessness; The development of needed permanent and transitional housing for both those persons experiencing chronic homelessness and the growing numbers of homeless families; The coordination of housing and supporting services.  Means and Strategies Supporting community and economic development. HUD funds a variety of programs that support the community and economic development efforts of state and local communities. HUD's strategy focuses on providing and coordinating resources for neighborhood revitalization and other community development efforts by local partners. By employing these resources for building local economies and developing community assets, communities can leverage local contributions to address their priority problems:  The CDBG program is HUD's most important community development program and is one of the most flexible grant programs provided to localities by the federal government. A significant proportion of CDBG funds supports improving conditions in lower income and distressed communities.    Given the variety of individual needs and locally available resources, each community can best design its own strategies to help each homeless person and family achieve permanent housing and self-sufficiency. HUD's homeless assistance programs will continue to foster local initiatives by providing flexibility while providing incentives to meet important national objectives including ending chronic homelessness.  Objective C4: Mitigate housing conditions that threaten health. A safe housing stock is a critical precondition for safe, livable communities. Along with responsibility for HUDassisted private housing and public housing, HUD  24  HUD Strategic Plan   Strengthen Communities    Under the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act,4 HUD has designated 40 areas of pervasive poverty, unemployment and general distress as Renewal Communities (RCs). Businesses in Renewal Communities will be eligible for federal tax incentives as well as tax relief and regulatory streamlining provided by state and local jurisdictions. HUD also has designated a third round of Empowerment Zones (EZs), which will receive all the tax benefits of current EZs even though grants will not be available. HUD's multifamily Neighborhood Networks centers will continue to strengthen communities by: (1) Providing services for adults, youth and seniors. Adults receive job training and placement, education and supportive services. Youth improve their academic achievement. Seniors become connected to their community and on-line services and information, and often youth in the community become involved with seniors through the center. (2) Helping to reduce property crime and vandalism, thereby producing safer communities. (3) Providing local employers with skilled workers. (4) Supporting service providers. And (5) benefiting taxpayers, as residents of HUD housing become more economically self-sufficient and rely less on government subsidies. Under the Section 242 program, HUD helps hospitals access affordable financing for capital projects. Uses for HUD hospital loans include new construction, modernization and refinancing. Since the program began in 1968, 311 hospital mortgages have been insured for approximately $9 billion. Clients range from small rural hospitals to major urban medical centers. These hospitals serve as community anchors, providing not only needed healthcare services, but also jobs that range from entry level to professional. Many of the hospitals are in distressed communities and in areas designated as medically underserved. Often, they are the largest employers in their communities. Without access to capital through HUD-insured loans, some hospitals would not have been able to afford the repairs, renovations and equipment to remain open. Through the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction and the Healthy Homes Program, HUD funds local organizations to eliminate the residential lead-based paint hazards that threaten low-income children. By establishing suitable goals for the governmentsponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac, HUD ensures that more housing capital is available to promote homeownership and affordable rental housing in underserved areas.  HUD encourages use of FHA loan programs and purchase of HUD homes in distressed neighborhoods to improve housing conditions and raise homeownership rates. Through the proposed Colonias Gateway Initiative, help rural communities and neighborhoods along the 1,500-mile Mexican border meet their substantial community development needs. Encourage grantees to certify Section 3 residents and businesses and provide more permanent job opportunities in fields other than construction. This will be done through monitoring and compliance reviews and technical assistance, encouraging grantees to enter into training agreements with universities and state- and locally funded training agencies. HUD will require that Section 3-related grievances are processed and settlements are generated as a result of noncompliance. HUD also supports the redevelopment of distressed communities through the University Partnership programs and the Indian Community Block Grant program.            Streamline the consolidated planning process, making it more results-oriented and useful to communities. While the diversity of community development efforts makes them difficult to measure and quantify, HUD is working with local stakeholders to identify performance measures that make the consolidated planning process more results-oriented and useful to communities in assessing their own progress toward addressing the problems of low-income areas. Streamlining the consolidated planning process was identified in the PMA as an important area for HUD's focus. The Department issued guidance clarifying current consolidated planning requirements in November 2002. The reform initiative is based on the conviction that community revitalization efforts are most effective if they are tailored to local circumstances and reflect the views of local stakeholders. HUD also is looking at how technology can play a larger role in making improvements in the consolidated planning process.  Input from city, county and state representatives from around the country suggested some streamlining changes would enhance the usefulness of the consolidated planning and reporting process.      4  Incorporated by reference in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 (P.L. 106554).  HUD Strategic Plan  25   Strengthen Communities  These changes include: 1) integration with existing plans and reporting documents, 2) use of standardized templates, 3) replacement of the Community 2020 mapping software with a Webbased system, 4) decreasing narrative required, 5) receiving more guidance from HUD on reporting performance and 6) a more flexible Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) that allows simple adjustments in performance measurements and easy collection and organization of data.  Performance measures for broad formula programs such as CDBG are best when tailored to local circumstances and reflective of local visions of success. HUD will build on local efforts in demonstrating performance by designing performance measurement strategies that link goals and objectives to annual reporting of projects while maintaining local flexibility. HUD will be sharing these models with grantees and pilot testing performance measures in selected communities during 2003. Other steps will include the development of standardized measures that grantees can use and improved use of benchmarks.    As homeless families and individuals better access needed mainstream services, and as the coordination between HUD and other federal agencies coalesces, it is HUD's goal to work to concurrently reduce the proportion of HUD homeless funds used for the provision of social services and to increase the proportion used for housing. A key tool for ending chronic homelessness will be to provide permanent supportive housing--housing combined with services. The Department has and will continue to ensure that at least 30 percent of all available homeless funding is awarded for permanent housing. Providing permanent supportive housing will significantly reduce the cost of medical, mental health and criminal justice resources that are used for persons experiencing chronic homelessness. In fact, recent research has demonstrated that providing permanent supportive housing costs about the same as leaving an individual on the streets and having him or her cycle through the various disconnected health care, correctional, mental health and substance abuse treatment institutions. HUD will carefully scrutinize the policies of its mainstream housing programs to determine whether additional mainstream housing resources can be brought to bear on the problem of homelessness, including both persons experiencing chronic homelessness and homelessness among families. HUD's internal task force to reduce barriers to persons with special needs in accessing HUD's housing and community development resources has identified numerous initiatives that HUD program offices will pursue with providers of assistance to persons who are homeless and persons with HIV/AIDS. Two examples include an initiative by Ginnie Mae that will provide the right of first refusal to homeless service organizations on the purchase of Ginnie Mae manufactured housing inventory, and a new FHA requirement that 10 percent of all HUD-owned multifamily units conveyed to state and local governments with right of first refusal will be designated for homeless persons. HUD is also collaborating with other federal agencies in efforts to better connect HUD program recipients with resources made available to address health, human services, job development, education and other services that are needed by persons with special needs. The results of these efforts should help ensure that HUD recipients achieve their housing mission with improved access to the related social services provided by other federal programs.      End chronic homelessness and move homeless families and individuals to permanent housing. The primary focus of HUD's efforts to end chronic homelessness and address the needs of other homeless households is to provide both flexible and targeted resources to communities as well as to encourage planning and coordination to maximize the impact of these resources.  HUD's FY 2001 Appropriations Act reauthorized the Interagency Council on the Homeless (ICH) through FY 2005. The Secretaries of HUD, HHS and Veterans Affairs (VA) have created an interagency working group to both identify the obstacles to enrollment of homeless people in mainstream service programs and recommend specific changes--legislative, policy and procedural--that would make federal mainstream supportive service programs (e.g., Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Substance Abuse Block Grants, Mental Health Block Grant, Food Stamps) more accessible to homeless people. One tangible result of this interagency effort is a $35 million joint venture by the three federal agencies to help weave together housing and social services for homeless people with addictions, mental illnesses, prison histories and other root causes of persistent homelessness.     26  HUD Strategic Plan   Strengthen Communities  Finally, HUD will continue to:  Assist communities in developing the Congressionally mandated Homeless Management Information Systems (HMISs) to track homeless persons moving through emergency shelter, transitional housing and into permanent housing. HMISs will identify the characteristics of homeless persons and track milestones, including access to benefits, educational opportunities and employment. Encourage states and communities to improve discharge planning from their health care, foster care, youth facilities and criminal justice programs, so that, upon discharge, people move to stable permanent housing rather than becoming homeless. Provide extensive technical assistance to applicants and potential applicants for the Department's homeless assistance programs. In addition to a continuation of the local, regional and national technical assistance resources already in place, HUD will inaugurate targeted technical assistance specifically tailored to faith-based organizations and organizations serving homeless persons living in Colonias areas. Existing targeted technical assistance efforts under way to veteran service organizations will also be expanded.  International exchanges about urban issues. The Housing Act of 1957 gives broad latitude to the Secretary to ""...exchange data relating to housing and urban planning and development with other nations and assemble such data from other nations, through participation in international conferences and other means, where such exchange or assembly is deemed by him to be beneficial."" Such exchanges can improve the knowledge base related to strengthening communities in the United States and abroad. In coordination with the White House and the Department of State, HUD's Office of International Affairs, part of HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research, supports the diverse international interests of the Secretary, implements cooperative exchange programs with foreign governments and international organizations and promotes research collaboration between governments in housing finance, building technology, community planning and development and national urban policy. Over the next few years, it is likely that the Department will enter into other bilateral and multilateral cooperative programs as it identifies common urban policy research interests with foreign governments and international organizations.      Performance Measures Long-Term Performance Measures HUD will assess its long-term success in achieving this goal by measuring the following outcomes discussed below:        The share of CDBG entitlement funds that benefit low- and moderate-income persons remains at or exceeds 92 percent. The share of state CDBG funds that benefit low- and moderate-income persons remains at or exceeds 96 percent. Neighborhoods in which significant CDBG investments have been made will demonstrate increases in measurements of neighborhood health. By FY 2008, over 400,000 jobs will be created or retained through CDBG. The number of communities that have implemented HMIS is maximized. The number of persons experiencing chronic homelessness declines by up to 50 percent by FY 2008. The number of children who have elevated blood lead levels will be less than 260,000 by 2004 and less than 56,000 by 2008.  HUD Strategic Plan  27   Strengthen Communities  The share of CDBG entitlement funds that benefit low- and moderate-income persons remains at or exceeds 92 percent. Entitlement communities are required to use at least 70 percent of their CDBG funds for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income residents. CDBG grantees historically have exceeded this requirement, and HUD has an interest in encouraging continuing strong performance in this area so the greatest local needs are met. Of the approximately $3.5 billion in CDBG entitlement funds spent during FY 2001, 94.9 percent were spent on activities that had benefit for low- and moderate-income households, up from 93.7 percent in FY 2000.  indicator(s) to measure improvements in neighborhoods in which significant CDBG investments have been made. The ACS will begin collecting rolling samples in 2003 and beginning in 2008 will have sufficient data for tractlevel estimates for 2005. In the interim, HUD will continue to work with stakeholders to develop a viable methodology for assessing neighborhood health and CDBG investment over time. Implementation is dependent on anticipated improvements to IDIS.  By FY 2008, over 400,000 jobs will be created or retained through CDBG. Many communities choose to use a significant portion of their CDBG grants to improve the local economy and help their citizens find productive work. In FY 2001, entitlement communities used $283 million--8.3 percent of their funds--for economic development, and states used $206 million or 18.9 percent. The estimates for CDBG are the expected number of jobs created or retained during the fiscal year, based on the average job creation or retention per grant dollar as reported by grantees and projected outlays.  The share of state CDBG funds that benefit low- and moderate-income persons remains at or exceeds 96 percent. Whereas the prior measure relates to the targeting of CDBG grants by entitlement communities, this measure relates to the targeting of CDBG funds by states. Like entitlement communities, states are required to use at least 70 percent of their CDBG funds for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income residents. CDBG grantees historically have exceeded this requirement, and HUD has an interest in encouraging continuing strong performance in this area so the greatest local needs are met. States used 96.4 percent of the roughly $1.5 billion of CDBG funds they spent in FY 2001 on activities that had benefit for low- and moderate-income persons.  The number of communities that have implemented HMIS is maximized. Counting homeless individuals and families is both difficult and expensive. Rather than relying on special national surveys to measure progress in achieving this goal, HUD will instead utilize the evolving infrastructure of HMISs. Although at present only a small percentage of all jurisdictions have HMISs, the number will increase significantly in the coming years. HUD is working toward attaining a nationally representative sample of jurisdictions through HMISs to measure progress under this goal. This performance measure will estimate the incidence of homelessness in HMIS jurisdictions to see if the expected outcome--a decline in homelessness--is achieved. Initially, the measure will use data from all valid HMIS systems. Once a nationally representative sample of jurisdictions has HMISs, this measure will utilize data from that sample.  Neighborhoods in which significant CDBG investments have been made will demonstrate increases in measurements of neighborhood health. This performance measure will help the Department assess the contribution of CDBG and other HUD economic development programs that are intended to improve conditions in distressed communities. Neighborhood health will be measured at the census tract level based on indicators such as median housing prices, income levels, number of new businesses, housing vacancy rates, crime, labor force participation, overcrowding of housing units, the incidence of singleparent households and the incidence of households receiving public assistance. Since grantees make the key choices on priorities to pursue, which activities to fund and how to design them, HUD will seek their input. Consolidated Plan Initiative pilots will help inform options for this measure. HUD will use data from the American Community Survey (ACS) as well as other sources such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Dun and Bradstreet, for which there is a positive correlation between CDBG expenditure and the 28 HUD Strategic Plan  The number of persons experiencing chronic homelessness declines by up to 50 percent by FY 2008. While there is currently no way to accurately measure the number of persons who experience chronic homelessness, HUD is working with other federal agencies and communities to develop definitions and methods for estimating the extent of chronic homelessness and progress under this goal. The targeted reduction of 50 percent represents substantial progress toward the ten-year goal of eliminating chronic   Strengthen Communities  homelessness. HUD will develop an estimate of the total number of persons experiencing chronic homelessness in the United States by December 2003. This estimate will serve as the baseline for this performance measure.  The number of children who have elevated blood lead levels will be less than 260,000 by 2004 and less than 56,000 by 2008. Approximately 890,000 children under the age of six were estimated to have elevated blood lead levels (EBL) in the period from 199194. These children, especially those less than three years old, are vulnerable to permanent developmental problems because of the wellunderstood effect of lead on developing nervous systems. This indicator reflects an aggressive goal of reducing the number of children with EBL to 260,000 by 2004 and 56,000 by 2008. While substantial progress has been made in reducing the number of children with EBL, additional progress is needed to address this significant health threat. Local data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 19 states showed that the proportion of children under the age of six who tested with EBL decreased from 10.5 percent in 1996 to 7.6 percent in 1998. By 1999, preliminary results indicated that the mean blood lead level had declined 26 percent from the 199194 period. The CDC is expected to release updated estimates of children with EBL in 2004 and annually thereafter through its National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Blood lead level estimates are the best performance measure of the HUD lead hazard control program. HUD's recentlycompleted national Survey of Lead-Based Paint in Housing shows that the number of housing units with lead-based paint declined from 64 million in 1990 to 38 million in 2000. HUD will repeat this survey in 2004. EBL is more common among low-income children living in older housing. In addition to HUD's lead-based paint hazard control grant program and regulations concerning federally-assisted housing, other factors causing the decrease in the number of children with EBL are demolition, substantial rehabilitation and hazard control financed by the private sector or local and state government and ongoing public education.  HUD Strategic Plan  29   Strengthen Communities  Intermediate Measures Supporting this Goal        During FY 2004, a total of 84,000 jobs will be created or retained through CDBG. During FY 2004, the share of CDBG funds that qualify as benefiting low- and moderate-income persons remains or exceeds 96 percent for states and 92 percent for entitlement communities. By 2004, 300 Continuums of Care will report to HUD the institutional discharge activities that will help to prevent homelessness. By December 2003, HUD will develop an estimate of the total number of persons experiencing chronic homelessness in the United States. The proportion of HUD homeless funding spent on housing activities increases and the proportion spent on social services declines. The number of communities with at least 75 percent of their beds covered by HMIS will increase by 50 during FY 2004. Of those in HUD's homeless projects, 45,000 will become employed and 80,000 will become permanently housed in 2004; from 200408, a total of 175,000 people will become employed, and a total of 250,000 will move into permanent housing. Achievement of milestones for reforming the consolidated planning process: o o o Design pilot of alternative planning procedures and identify communities prepared to test them by March 31, 2003; Evaluate the pilots to inform policy, legislative and regulatory changes needed to implement this initiative by March 31, 2004; Review needed changes to grants management system requirements to support local setting and tracking of performance and aggregation of results relative to national program goals by September 30, 2004.    External Factors Community and economic development The success of distressed communities in improving their economic conditions depends heavily on broad macro-economic trends in their region and the nation. The recent economic slowdown also has led to higher unemployment rates, reduced revenues and lower spending on public services by states and localities. A rapidly changing global economy has made it challenging for Americans to compete when capital is highly mobile, markets for goods and services are widely dispersed and wages for low-skilled employment are much lower in many locations abroad. Local shortages of low-skilled jobs are compounded by mismatches between the locations of available jobs and the residences of the unemployed. Many older urban communities have adopted aggressive strategies to 30 HUD Strategic Plan  alleviate these mismatches, but they face numerous barriers including tax rates, scarcity of land, scattered and/or absentee ownership, large concentrations of poor residents, blighted/vacant properties and schools with fewer resources. Rural communities often face additional challenges because of the changing structure of the farming industry, underinvestment, weak infrastructure, limited services and few community institutions. CDBG, HUD's primary source of community and economic development funding, helps ensure that greater resources continue to flow toward poorer, slowgrowing, distressed areas. While HUD can encourage certain uses of funds, and while funds are targeted to low- and moderate-income residents as the primary beneficiaries, each jurisdiction makes its own decision about how to use CDBG funds.   Strengthen Communities  Homelessness Success in helping the homeless achieve housing stability is affected by a variety of factors beyond HUD's control. The incidence of homelessness is driven by macroeconomic forces such as unemployment levels, the supply of low-skilled jobs and the availability of low-cost housing. Personal factors such as domestic violence, mental illness, substance abuse, disabilities, HIV/AIDS, other chronic health issues and the extent of a person's educational or job skills also contribute to homelessness. Discrimination against persons with disabilities can also lead to homelessness. The Department's success in achieving this objective also depends critically on the efforts of a wide variety of community partners.  HUD Strategic Plan  31   32  HUD Strategic Plan   Strategic Goal  Ensure Equal Oppor tunity In Housing ""Housing discrimination is not only illegal, it contradicts in every way the principles of freedom and opportunity we treasure as Americans. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is committed to ensuring that for everyone seeking a place to live, all housing is Fair Housing."" -Secretary Mel Martinez  Overview Part of HUD's core mission has always been to help families find affordable and decent housing. This mission will be fulfilled when all Americans have an equal opportunity to buy or rent housing that matches their individual needs. Unfortunately, discrimination against minorities and persons with disabilities exists. These include architectural barriers, refusals to rent or sell, denials of financing and a lack of housing options. These barriers have resulted in an exclusion of some individuals from the diverse housing opportunities that should be available to them. HUD is committed to ending the practice of discrimination through enforcement of fair housing laws as well as through educating lenders, housing providers, developers, architects, homeseekers, landlords and tenants about rights and obligations in complying with the laws. Working with state and local partners--as well as the private sector--the Department is involved in a cooperative effort to increase access to the nation's housing stock so that more Americans can afford to live where they want to live. Over the past three years, HUD has conducted several key studies to determine the levels of fair housing awareness and the types of discrimination that people experience. HUD's Housing Discrimination Study 2000 (HDS 2000) provides the most rigorous nationwide estimates of housing discrimination since HUD's 1989 Housing Discrimination Study. HDS 2000 found that African-American renters and homebuyers and Hispanic homebuyers experienced significant declines in discrimination between 1989 and 2000, while the discrimination rate against Hispanic renters remained virtually unchanged during the same period. Nonetheless, the overall level of housing discrimination experienced by African Americans and Hispanics remains high.  HUD's 2002 Housing Awareness Study ""How Much Do We Know?"" measured the general public's knowledge of fair housing laws and their prohibitions against rental and sales discrimination. Although the study indicated that fair housing education and enforcement had greatly increased awareness, it also found that many Americans still do not recognize unlawful discrimination when it occurs. For example, 46 percent of people surveyed did not know that it is illegal for real-estate agents to limit a home search to certain neighborhoods based on the race of the home seeker and the racial composition of the neighborhood. When asked about differential treatment of families with children, an alarming 62 percent of those surveyed were not aware that such different treatment was illegal. In 2001, HUD studied pre-application lending discrimination in two major metropolitan areas. The ""All Other Things Being Equal"" study found that while minorities and whites receive equal treatment in the majority of cases, there are patterns of unequal treatment that systematically favor whites. For example, African Americans received less information about the loans and less follow-up than white homebuyers with similar economic histories. In one city, Hispanic borrowers were quoted a loan amount that was on average $10,000 less than the amount quoted to whites with identical economic profiles. These differences in treatment, even at the pre-application stage, influence a family's decision about what home to choose and the amount of the loan and type of loan they can afford. These studies provide HUD with important information to fulfill its mission and ensure equal opportunity in housing.  HUD Strategic Plan  33   Ensure Equal Opportunity in Housing  Objective FH1: Resolve discrimination complaints on a timely basis. HUD is responsible for enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and for ensuring that HUD programs promote fair housing and comply with civil rights laws. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing against persons based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status. Unfortunately, discrimination is still a reality for many Americans--including racial and ethnic minorities, families with children and persons with disabilities. The Department investigates all complaints filed by individuals who believe they have experienced discrimination in housing. Resolving these complaints on a timely basis reflects HUD's commitment to continuing and improving this important aspect of its work.  Means and Strategies HUD and its office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity will promote fair housing through a number of continuing and expanded programs, activities and strategies.  Resolve discrimination complaints on a timely basis and promote public awareness of fair housing laws.  Investigate and resolve (as appropriate) housing discrimination complaints under the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 109 of Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Encourage, support and expand the network of state and local agencies that enforce laws that are ""substantially equivalent"" to the federal Fair Housing Act. Encourage, support and expand private fair housing groups in unserved and underserved areas such as those not already served by substantially equivalent agencies. Educate homeowners and renters, the housing industry, lenders, recipients, grantees and project sponsors about fair housing laws. Work with the Department of Justice to enforce the Fair Housing Act, to aggressively handle criminal acts of housing discrimination (e.g., hate crimes) and cases that involve either a pattern and practice of discrimination or discriminatory zoning and land use activities. Work with the Departments of Treasury and Justice to ensure that Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects are in compliance with the Fair Housing Act. Administer two primary grant programs that help to reduce the incidence of housing discrimination--the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) and the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP). o FHAP provides grants to state and local agencies to enforce laws that are substantially equivalent to the federal Fair Housing Act. FHIP provides funds to public and private fair housing groups, as well as to state and local agencies, to educate the public and housing industry about fair housing laws, investigate allegations of discrimination and help combat predatory lending practices.  Objective FH2: Promote public awareness of fair housing laws. This strategic plan is the first to make increasing public awareness of fair housing law a strategic objective. To raise public awareness of fair housing laws, HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) works in a cooperative effort with builders, landlords, tenants and other stakeholders to ensure the right of equal housing opportunity and free and fair housing choice without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or family composition. The ""How Much Do We Know?"" study, described above, suggests that prior efforts to boost awareness of fair housing laws may have been successful but that more work is needed to increase public awareness of these basic protections.        Objective FH3: Improve housing accessibility for persons with disabilities. The Department has a series of programs that help to improve the accessibility of housing to persons with disabilities, including rental housing programs and fair housing enforcement activities. As a result of HUD's enforcement efforts under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination in federally assisted programs or activities, HUD anticipates an increase in accessible housing. HUD also has a statutory responsibility to ensure that individuals are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving HUD assistance. HUD engages in educational efforts to acquaint the public and building community with the rules regarding accessibility and enforces compliance with the Fair Housing Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act.      o  34  HUD Strategic Plan   Ensure Equal Opportunity in Housing    Monitor the government-sponsored enterprises' (GSEs') compliance with fair housing requirements and the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act (FHEFSSA).  with Disabilities; and other rental assistance of nonelderly persons with disabilities.  Track the number of building professionals such as architects, builders and code officials who are educated through training events, seminars and workshops sponsored by HUD and the industry regarding Fair Housing Act accessibility guidelines and requirements for new construction or who otherwise learn of these requirements.  Improve the accessibility of housing to persons with disabilities.   Provide more homeownership opportunities to persons with disabilities through FHA. Administer housing programs for the disabled, including the Section 811 rental housing program; Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS; Mainstream Housing Opportunities for Persons  Performance Measures Long-Term Performance Measures HUD will assess its long-term success in achieving this goal by measuring the following outcomes discussed below:      Awareness of fair housing laws increases from the 2001 baseline. The number of newly accessible HUD-assisted housing units, as a result of HUD's efforts to enforce Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, increases by 7,500 by 2008. By the end of FY 2008, no more than 20 percent of the open fair housing complaints, excluding pattern and practice and systemic complaints, will be aged over 100 days. By the end of FY 2008, no more than 35 percent of FHAP aged complaints, excluding pattern and practice and systemic complaints, will be aged over 100 days. From FY 2003 through FY 2008, the percentage of architects and builders indicating awareness of the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act increases.  Awareness of fair housing laws increases from the 2001 baseline. Broader awareness of fair housing laws is critical to reducing discriminatory actions. HUD completed a national survey of fair housing awareness in 2001 that found relatively widespread knowledge of some core fair housing protections and prohibitions, yet a more limited understanding of others. The baseline survey showed that, while almost half of the general public can correctly identify as unlawful six or more of eight scenarios describing illegal conduct, almost one-quarter of persons surveyed knew the law in two or fewer of the eight scenarios. This indicator tracks the effect of HUDconducted or funded fair housing public information campaigns on public understanding of their rights and responsibilities under the law. HUD plans a similar survey in FY 2006 to determine whether awareness of the fair housing laws has improved. By 2006, HUD's goal is to increase awareness so the number of persons correctly identifying six or more of the eight scenarios will increase from 51 percent to 55 percent. The number of persons getting two or less correct would decrease from 16 percent to 12 percent.  HUD Strategic Plan  35   Ensure Equal Opportunity in Housing  The number of newly accessible HUDassisted housing units, as a result of HUD's efforts to enforce Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, increases by 7,500 by 2008. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination because of disability in federally assisted programs. HUD's implementing regulations generally require that a minimum of 5 percent of housing units be accessible to persons with disabilities. An additional 2 percent must be accessible to persons with hearing or vision impairments. HUD conducts compliance reviews of recipients of HUD assistance to determine if they are complying with Section 504. When recipients are found to be in apparent noncompliance with Section 504, HUD may enter into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the recipient to correct the noncompliance. As a result of these efforts, HUD expects to have legally binding agreements to create 1,500 newly accessible units per year, or an additional 7,500 units by 2008.  expects the percentage of HUD aged fair housing complaints will decrease annually by 2 percent.  By the end of FY 2008, no more than 35 percent of FHAP aged complaints, excluding pattern and practice and systemic complaints, will be aged over 100 days. The FHAP provides grants to state and local agencies to enforce laws that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act. This measure tracks the processing time for complaints handled by HUD, including time for determination of jurisdiction and for conducting investigations and conciliation. Complaints alleging either pattern and practice or systemic violations (either geographically or throughout an industry) are excluded because they typically require broader and more complex investigations. HUD expects the proportion of FHAP complaints that are aged, excluding pattern and practice complaints, to decrease by 2 percentage points annually. At the end of FY 2001, 69.3 percent of these fair housing complaints were aged. At the end of FY 2002, 48 percent were aged. By the end of FY 2008, no more than 35 percent of open FHAP complaint inventory will be aged.  By the end of FY 2008, no more than 20 percent of the open fair housing complaints, excluding pattern and practice and systemic complaints, will be aged over 100 days. Efficient enforcement of processing is an important dimension of the fair housing performance of HUD. Speedy processing encourages victims of discrimination to file complaints and increases the likelihood that violations will be punished. This measure tracks the processing time for complaints handled by HUD, including time for determination of jurisdiction and for conducting investigations and conciliation, excluding pattern and practice and systemic complaints. Complaints alleging either pattern and practice or systemic violations (either geographically or throughout an industry) are excluded because they typically require broader and more complex investigations. At the end of FY 2001, 37 percent of fair housing complaints in the HUD inventory were aged. At the close of FY 2002, the percent of aged complaints fell to 29 percent. HUD  From FY 2003 through FY 2008, the percentage of architects and builders indicating awareness of the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act increases. HUD will work with housing industry associations such as the National Association of Home Builders and other federal agencies such as the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service to devise methods for sampling the multifamily housing industry to measure the impact of HUD training, technical guidance and marketing initiatives on the awareness level of architects, builders and others regarding the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act. During FY 2003, HUD will work to develop a baseline level of awareness among multifamily builders.  Intermediate Measures Supporting this Goal    The percentage of fair housing complaints aged over 100 days in the HUD inventory decreases 2 percentage points per year. The percentage of fair housing complaints aged over 100 days in the FHAP inventory decreases 2 percentage points per year. Create 1,500 newly accessible units annually through legally binding agreements as a result of enforcement of Section 504. HUD Strategic Plan  36   Ensure Equal Opportunity in Housing  External Factors Social, cultural and economic conditions influence the acceptance of minorities and persons with disabilities. Local policies and practices impacting the development and construction of housing will continue to have some influence on the levels of discrimination, income isolation and disparate homeownership rates. The need for accessible housing and housing that provides access to supportive services in community settings will be greater than before. In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that states must place persons with disabilities in community settings rather than institutions when treatment professionals determine that community placement is appropriate (Olmstead v. L.C.). As a result of this decision, more persons with disabilities will be moving into communities at a time when affordable housing is increasingly scarce.  HUD Strategic Plan  37   38  HUD Strategic Plan   Strategic Goal  Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability ""Public service is a public trust, and the public's confidence is earned, not assumed. We hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards and are guided each day by our insistence on accountability with results."" -Secretary Mel Martinez  Overview To achieve the Department's other strategic goals effectively, it is essential that HUD employees and HUD's partners embrace high standards of ethics, management and accountability. Because HUD manages public programs using public resources, HUD is accountable for ensuring that government funds are handled properly and achieve the purposes for which those resources were provided. The Secretary has made stronger ethics and accountability a top priority. Part of putting compassionate conservatism into action means using resources efficiently and effectively so HUD has the means to help others live the American Dream. This goal cuts across all of the Department's programs and applies to each employee and each partner organization that contributes to HUD's mission. This goal also stresses the importance HUD places on its most valuable resources--its employees and program partners-- recognizing that it is only through their efforts that HUD's mission will be carried out. The importance of these resources is reflected in the development of HUD's Strategic Human Capital Management Plan to guide its efforts in this area through 2008. The Department has already improved its management and operations. The General Accounting Office (GAO) recognized HUD's progress in addressing HUD programs deemed to be high-risk.5 GAO's report indicated that the remaining programs requiring additional improvement are single-family mortgage insurance and rental housing assistance. Additionally, GAO has identified human capital management and the need for a strategic approach to managing HUD's staff as the most pressing management challenge facing HUD. Other key management challenges are information systems, including financial management systems, and acquisitions management. Recent feedback from HUD employees has indicated a need to improve internal communications and employee involvement. Four objectives under this goal articulate the Department's long-term efforts to address management challenges and to become an increasingly highperforming agency.  Objective EM1: Rebuild HUD's human capital and further diversify its workforce. This strategic objective raises the visibility of human capital issues as a mission-critical management challenge at HUD. HUD's goal is to develop and maintain a workforce where its employees are renowned for their professional leadership, management and technical competency and have the opportunity to gain the widest possible range of skills and experiences. The impending retirement of over half of HUD's workforce over the next several years poses a significant threat to HUD's operations. As GAO has recognized, this is a government-wide problem. HUD views it as an opportunity to attract and develop a new cadre of employees to take on the future challenges of housing and being able to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans and American families. In the future, all employees of HUD will have the knowledge and skills to manage information effectively. An adequate diversity of skills and backgrounds in HUD's workforce will increase exponentially its ability to successfully respond to constituent needs. Critical to  5  U.S. General Accounting Office, ""Major Management Challenges and Program Risks: Department of Housing and Urban Development,"" January 2003.  HUD Strategic Plan  39   Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability  HUD's success in managing human capital will be an increased emphasis on internal communications.  has increased the challenges involved in HUD's monitoring efforts to ensure accountability. To balance the competing objectives of devolution and accountability, HUD will continue to focus on improving enforcement and regulatory oversight throughout its programs. This will be accomplished by strengthening HUD's field offices so they have the staff and authority to properly monitor local use of HUD resources, continuing to strengthen HUD's remote monitoring capacity through information technology and other means, and targeting monitoring resources to areas most at risk of abuse. Giving HUD's partners a clear set of performance and accountability standards is the best way to ensure accountability.  Objective EM2: Improve HUD's management, internal controls and systems and resolve audit issues. HUD will remain focused on the continuous improvement of the organization and functions, and respond as effectively to the needs of its partners as the private sector responds to its customers. As a large organization with multiple responsibilities, HUD must maintain strong internal controls to ensure that HUD effectively meets its responsibilities, including the elimination of fraud, waste and abuse of federal resources. As discussed in more detail below, HUD's most significant management challenges are to:      Complete Department-wide organizational changes; Improve financial management systems; Ensure adequate and sufficiently trained HUD staff; Improve FHA single-family origination and real estate owned (REO) property oversight; and Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public and assisted housing program administration.  Objective EM5: Improve internal communications and employee involvement. HUD will take steps over the duration of this plan to improve internal communications and employee involvement. The outcome of these actions will be a more cohesive organization that exhibits greater comprehension of, commitment to and capacity for achieving departmental goals. The need for increased use of two-way communication tools linking all organizational levels within the Department was identified through results of HUD's 2002 Organizational Assessment Survey (OAS). More than half of HUD employees responding indicated the need for an increase in communications between different organizational levels, and many said they are generally ill informed on organizational conditions and issues related to their job. New tools will ensure an active feedback loop capable of disseminating mission and policy information, while also encouraging employee input. The result will be a more cohesive organization with greater comprehension of departmental goals and increased commitment and capacity for achieving them.  Objective EM3: Improve accountability, service delivery and customer service of HUD and its partners. HUD's extensive use of the partnership model is a fundamental aspect of the Department's operations. This objective highlights HUD's goal of improving the performance of its partners as well as the goal of the President's Management Agenda (PMA) to improve the performance of intermediaries. HUD's partners include state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, for-profit organizations and even other federal agencies. HUD has a legal and financial relationship with 4,500 PHAs and numerous private housing providers. Approximately 4,000 localities and service providers administer HUD's community development programs. Private partners also participate in housing finance programs that insure mortgages and guarantee mortgagebacked securities totaling over a half trillion dollars.  Means and Strategies Dealing with mission-critical management challenges. In February 2002, HUD's Inspector General (IG) identified five management challenges faced by HUD. Addressing these challenges is an extremely high priority for the Department. The IG findings provide a roadmap for the management challenges HUD intends to address under this goal. These same priorities are reflected in specific agreements made by the Department as part of the PMA. The PMA also includes five government-wide efforts in the areas of human resources, eGovernment, competitive sourcing, financial performance and budget and performance integration, as well as other HUDspecific goals. Information on how HUD plans to meet  Objective EM4: Ensure program compliance. The increased devolution of authority in many of HUD's programs has given housing agencies and local administrators the opportunity to adapt the programs to meet local conditions and priorities. At the same time, it 40 HUD Strategic Plan   Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability  these challenges is described below. A number of performance indicators are included in HUD's Annual Performance Plans to track the successful completion and ongoing benefits of these management milestones.  Complete Department-wide organizational changes. During FY 2002, HUD improved internal management by consolidating several independent offices under existing program offices. The formerly independent offices included the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC), the Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC), the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring and offices of the Chief Information Officer and Chief Procurement Officer. HUD has also reorganized its Office of the Chief Information Officer and consolidated the security functions into the Office of Security and Emergency Planning. These efforts consolidated staff expertise into organizations where it was already concentrated, improved management's span of control and substantially resolved the management reforms begun several years ago. Field offices have been empowered to solve local problems through the appointment of regional directors and field office directors with clear lines of authority for operational management. Improve financial management systems. Recent substantial improvements in financial controls have enabled HUD to receive clean audit opinions for three consecutive years. Weaknesses in FHA information systems have been a recurring source of audit deficiencies. These problems will be resolved by the phased implementation of an integrated financial system for FHA by the end of 2006. The first phase, implementation of FHA's new core general ledger system, was completed in October 2002. In addition, HUD is undertaking a thorough and rigorous assessment of all its financial systems. Known as the HUD Integrated Financial Management Improvement Project (HIFMIP), this effort is expected to be fully completed by FY 2007. Through this and other efforts, HUD plans to sharply reduce the number of financial management systems that fail to comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act. The Department also has acted to ensure timely management decisions on all audit recommendations made by the IG, and is taking steps during FY 2003 to cut in half the number of overdue final actions on these recommendations. Ensure adequate and sufficiently trained HUD staff. During FY 2002, the Total Estimation and Allocation Mechanism (TEAM) was implemented to provide information about workload accomplishments and staff utilization. TEAM establishes a foundation for better allocation of staff   resources according to workload during the early years covered by this Strategic Plan. Human capital issues are also examined annually under Quality Management Reviews. Building on this foundation, HUD will prepare a comprehensive, strategic workforce plan. This comprehensive plan will identify the kind of work to be done now and in the future; knowledge, skills and abilities of staff to do this work; capabilities and development needs of staff and appropriate deployment across organizations; and strategies for identifying and filling gaps. HUD will then work to close these gaps and reinforce high levels of ethical standards through the following means and strategies: o o Developing an education curriculum for core competencies; Establishing guidelines for minimum annual continuing education training and development requirements; Maintaining a skills inventory and training profile on each employee; Establishing an ethics training, briefing and information dissemination program.  o o    Improve FHA single-family origination. FHA single-family mortgage insurance programs may experience problems arising from inadequate monitoring and reviews of lender underwriting and property appraisals. To address these problems, FHA has implemented a process that removes nonperforming nonprofits and 203(k) consultants from the roster of approved program participants. Additional regulations are being processed that will further strengthen the oversight of program participants. These regulations will establish an Appraiser Watch system to measure the performance of individual appraisers, establish procedures for ensuring that all approved appraisers meet the requirements of the Appraisal Qualifications Board, require lenders to exercise more oversight of appraisers they employ and track the performance of lenders who underwrite loans. The Department is also promulgating a final rule to prohibit property flipping on FHA-insured mortgages. Several rules are also under development to increase the required qualifications of lenders who participate in the FHA program. Improve oversight of FHA REO property. The REO program disposes of the homes that become HUD property through mortgagor default. The HUD IG determined that HUD's oversight of Management and Monitoring (M&M) contractors who manage and sell REO properties was      HUD Strategic Plan  41   Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability  inadequate, and that insufficient public benefit was received from discounted sales of REO properties to nonprofit organizations. The Department has implemented procedures to monitor its M&M contractors, including onsite reviews, physical property inspections and data collection. Monthly performance letters are issued to each M&M contractor, and the contractor's response to identified deficiencies is resolved through verified corrective action. The Department also employs a risk analysis model on a monthly basis to track trends in M&M contractor performance. Finally, the Department performs a quarterly assessment of the M&M contractors targeted to three specific areas of performance: sales, property maintenance and contract compliance. This increased monitoring has resulted in significant improvement in the operation of the REO process. The inventory has been reduced to less than 30,000 properties, from 51,000 in FY 1999, and the net return to the government is the highest in the history of the program.  Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public and assisted housing program administration. One outcome of the inadequate monitoring of public and assisted housing providers has been the large number of incorrect rental subsidy determinations and associated loss of subsidy resources. HUD is addressing this issue with the Rental Housing Integrity Improvement Project (RHIIP), which will significantly reduce erroneous rent determinations in these programs during the course of this Plan. In addition, underutilization and recapture of funds have been significant problems for the Housing Choice Voucher Program. HUD will take steps to improve the delivery of these rental and homeownership subsidies by simplifying the administration and strengthening the management of this program. HUD also has implemented management assessment systems for public housing, assisted multifamily housing and voucher programs. Studies of these systems will validate the reliability of the information collected about program conditions and management. In addition, Section 8 Contract Administrators currently review and certify 100 percent of billing invoices for accuracy.  HUD is implementing a strategic human capital resources planning process to identify and justify staff resources and ensure staff are available and have the necessary skills to carry out HUD's mission. Key issues addressed by the human capital plan are workforce succession, retention, recruitment, training and placement. A well-trained, well-equipped and strategically placed staff is necessary to implement other means and strategies for this and the other five strategic goals. The Human Capital Steering Committee (made up of representatives from the major program areas at HUD) has drafted a Strategic Human Capital Management Plan for the agency. The Plan is designed to ensure that HUD is a mission-focused agency, has a high quality workforce and has an effective succession plan.  To become a mission-focused agency, employees will be aligned to fulfill the strategic goals efficiently and effectively. This will be accomplished through better deployment of the workforce, more careful alignment of business activities with HUD's mission and more consistent attention to addressing management challenges. To attain a high quality workforce, HUD will improve the recruitment, development and management of a high quality and diverse workforce. This will result in employees who have the knowledge, skills and abilities needed to perform their jobs; are empowered to do their jobs; and are rewarded for good performance and held accountable for marginal or unsatisfactory performance. Lastly, it is critical for HUD to have effective succession planning. This means that staff who retire over the next five years will be succeeded by qualified staff who are prepared to continue quality service and program delivery. It also implies that technical knowledge will be captured, documented and institutionalized to support sustainable high performance. Effective succession planning ensures that HUD's capacity to achieve its mission is replenished with fresh skills and knowledge; maintains the resource of institutional knowledge; provides for high levels of customer service even after waves of retirements; and retains highperforming mid-level and junior employees because clear lines of succession are established.      Using human capital effectively. Human resources are the indispensable key to accountable management. Using innovative human resource programs and flexibilities, HUD will recruit, develop, maintain and nurture a workforce that is strong in its diversity of skills, experiences and backgrounds. HUD will strive to maintain a work environment that encourages all employees to participate, learn and grow well into the 21st century. 42 HUD Strategic Plan  Managing information. Reliable information is the second critical factor needed to increase accountability. HUD has a number of strategies to improve the use of information. In recent years, the Department has greatly expanded the use of performance information to manage programs and operations, to guide budget decisions, to inform   Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability  stakeholders about program results and to strengthen enforcement of partners who fail to act with integrity. A number of the efforts described below are reflected and supported by performance goals in HUD's Annual Performance Plan:  Continue to use the annual Management Plan process to specify operational goals that support the goals established in the Annual Performance Plan. The overall Management Plan is integrated with Field Management Plans that reflect local resources, needs and opportunities. Maintain a strong research program focused on program evaluations to assess the effectiveness of HUD programs and develop recommendations for program improvements. Strengthen and replace financial management systems to improve the integrity of financial data and to ensure that accounts can be fully audited. Apply principles of business process analysis and evaluation, target enterprise architecture objectives and integrate common processes to improve HUD's management and internal controls, improve systems, resolve audit issues and improve service delivery to all customers. Continue to improve the Internet content, policy, technology and reliability of program data and certify compliance of program data systems according to the standards of the Chief Information Officer, the principles of enterprise architecture and performance-based system development practices. HUD's data quality initiative includes assessment of data elements in mission-critical systems, correcting data problems and certifying the systems. Information integrity also is being improved with a series of computer security projects and by implementing HUD's information quality policy for disseminated information. Increase citizen access to information on HUD's programs and their local implementation. This is accomplished through citizen participation in the Consolidated Plan process, as well as through electronic government. These ""eGov"" efforts include satellite broadcasts, Webcasts, HUD's award-winning Internet site and the HUD USER Web site, which focuses on research dissemination. Electronic government also is being implemented for core business purposes, beginning with eGrants.    Implement the RHIIP to reduce overpayments of low-income rent subsidies due to the incomplete reporting of tenant income, the improper calculation of tenant rent contributions and the failure to fully collect all outstanding rent. Efforts include developing software tools for housing providers, introducing a quality control program--including income matching--to monitor their performance, as well as exploring program simplification opportunities. Through the REAC, rate key partners--including PHAs and private owners of assisted housing--for financial management and physical upkeep. Low performing PHAs are referred to the Troubled Agency Recovery Center and Office of Public and Indian Housing for remedial action. Through REAC, rate the performance of Independent Public Accountants that perform financial audits of PHA and multifamily assisted properties. Poor performers are referred to the Departmental Enforcement Center for debarment. Through Housing's new Office of Regulatory Affairs and Manufactured Housing and the Office of General Counsel, protect consumers through investigations and enforcement actions under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and the Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act. Through FHA's Office of Single Family Housing, implement new protocols for the monitoring of FHA appraisers. Through HUD's Mortgage Review Board, levy fines against lending institutions and restrict their dealings with the FHA when they violate federal lending policies. Work with participants in the mortgage lending industry to reduce predatory lending. FHA is sharing the Neighborhood Watch/Early Warning system with lenders so that they, as well as FHA staff, can monitor mortgage default rates. Hire, train and retain a quality program monitoring and enforcement workforce capable of ensuring greater accountability for results by program participants.                          Enhancing monitoring and enforcement. A cornerstone of effective management and accountability consists of HUD's program monitoring, enforcement and regulatory oversight activities:  Working with partners. HUD's principal management and senior managers also are working closely with HUD's partners to jointly improve management operation and controls and strengthen incentives. HUD will:  HUD Strategic Plan  43   Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability    Periodically survey HUD's customers and partners to assess programs, policies and monitoring, as well as the Department's relationship with these stakeholders. Provide technical assistance to improve voucher utilization. Distribute additional vouchers to areas of high utilization. Consult with community development partners to streamline the Consolidated Plan development process. Through the Troubled Agency Recovery Centers and the Office of Public and Indian Housing, help troubled housing agencies improve management to achieve standard or high-performing status. Review the following programs to determine how to increase the rates of obligation and expenditure of funds: Housing Choice Vouchers, elderly housing grant funds (Section 202) and the Public Housing Capital Fund.  Building a communications loop. To improve internal communications and employee involvement, HUD will implement several strategies:  Effective communication vehicles. HUD will assess its communication vehicles to look at the function, effectiveness and audience of all internal communication vehicles used at HUD. This assessment will also determine potential new vehicles and communication channels. Improve upward communication. HUD will design a system of upward communication that seeks, acknowledges, responds to and uses employee feedback. Engage the field. HUD management will work with field directors to understand communication weaknesses unique to each office. This information will be used to build general communication strategies sensitive to the needs of field employees and specific initiatives responsive to individual offices.              Performance Measures Long-Term Performance Measures HUD will assess its long-term success in achieving this goal by measuring the following outcomes discussed below:      HUD's budget documents clearly link allocated resources to anticipated results, and policy directions and resources are linked to specific strategic goals. HUD will modernize its financial management and information systems. HUD will strengthen controls over rental housing assistance payments. HUD will strengthen controls over FHA's single family housing program risks. By 2008, HUD will have implemented its human capital strategic plan and will have its workforce training, retention and recruitment policies in place and determined acceptable by an independent review. The satisfaction of HUD partners with the Department's performance, operations and programs increases. Employee satisfaction will increase from the 2002 baseline by 2008.     44  HUD Strategic Plan   Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability  HUD's budget documents clearly link allocated resources to anticipated results, and policy directions and resources are linked to specific strategic goals. The PMA provides the guiding principle for budget and performance integration. HUD will develop its annual budget with a focus on collecting and using quality performance information, utilizing full cost accounting principles and emphasizing program evaluations and research to inform decisionmaking. HUD views the integration of performance and budgeting as an iterative process that will reflect shorter-term, intermediate and long-term results. Over time, the effort will require improved information and data in order to better mesh performance and budgeting efforts. Additional data will depend in part on systems and data development and pursuing needed program evaluations. The Department will work closely with OMB, other federal Departments, the Congress and its many partners to continue to improve and measure program performance.    Implementation of a performance-based, outcomeoriented infrastructure contract, called HUD IT Services (HITS), to provide improved services and innovative IT solutions. IT project management reviews at the highest levels to focus executive attention on projects needing direction. The use of Integrated Procurement Teams to manage and implement the transition of IT support contracts to performance-based contracts. Implementation of HUD's Enterprise Security Program to provide protection of HUD's critical infrastructure, both physical and information systems. This entails developing and implementing effective security procedures; security awareness and training; disaster recovery/contingency planning; and monitoring compliance and effectiveness of security procedures, policies and standards.        HUD will modernize its financial management and information systems. The PMA includes a specific focus on improving financial management performance. One of the key components of improving HUD's financial management performance is the modernization of financial systems, one of HUD's highest priorities. HUD financial systems currently fail to meet federal financial management requirements and applicable federal accounting standards. FHA has partially converted its private-sector accounting systems to comply with generally accepted federal accounting standards. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is leading a Department-wide effort to assess HUD's financial systems and carry out a program to bring the Department into compliance by FY 2007. Modernizing HUD's financial systems will not be easy. Notwithstanding, HUD has the sustained leadership commitment, time and resources to achieve success. To guide and support HUD's systems modernization efforts, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is leading a number of Information Technology (IT) management improvement efforts, including:   Refinement and institutionalization of HUD's IT Investment Management (ITIM) Process. Completion of HUD's Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiative to provide Department-wide documentation of HUD's current business and technology systems architecture baseline, as a basis for both better managing HUD's current information systems and better meeting future information systems needs through development of a ""target architecture"" for future systems development.  HUD will strengthen controls over rental housing assistance payments. The PMA includes the reduction of overpaid rental housing assistance as a separate HUD-specific initiative, with an overall goal of a 50 percent reduction in the $2 billion net annual assistance overpayment estimate by 2005. HUD has developed a comprehensive corrective action plan to address the root causes of these erroneous payments. Efforts are under way to reestablish an adequate program oversight capacity, through enhanced staffing, guidance, training, systems and enforcement. Improved guidance, training and automated tools for its third-party program administrators are also being provided. Improved computer matching and data sharing on assisted tenant income have the potential to reduce much of the estimated payment error. HUD has interim goals to reduce the overpaid assistance by 15 percent in 2003 and 30 percent in 2004, and there are plans to measure HUD's progress in meeting those targets.  HUD will strengthen controls over FHA's single family housing program risks. The number of program participants that fail to meet FHA's performance standards and compliance requirements will be significantly reduced. FHA is committed to fighting the practice known as property flipping to reduce the risk of loss to the FHA fund. Other FHA efforts will protect homebuyers from predatory lending practices. In addition, FHA's Appraiser Watch process automatically targets housing appraisers with poor performance records for monitoring, or even disqualified from program participation, when they hit certain unacceptable performance thresholds. FHA's Credit Watch,  HUD Strategic Plan  45   Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability  Neighborhood Watch and other program monitoring and enforcement efforts are also being strengthened.  By 2008, HUD will have implemented its human capital strategic plan and will have its workforce training, retention and recruitment policies in place and determined acceptable by an independent review. Under the PMA, HUD's five-year Human Capital Management Strategy aligns its human capital with its mission, goals and organizational objectives, and eliminates the skill gaps or deficiencies in mission critical occupations. HUD will address needed improvements in organizational structure, succession planning, recruiting and hiring, training and performance incentives, evaluation and recognition. A baseline of existing gaps in staff knowledge, skills and abilities will be established in 2004, and implementation of the Human Capital Management Strategy will result in a decrease in that baseline through 2007. This effort will also support other long-term performance measures under this strategic goal, such as integrating budget and performance and providing the skills needed to better manage information technology and reduce risks in the rental housing assistance and single-family housing programs.  Department's service and programs. A goal of the Department is to ensure a high level of satisfaction among those groups who are needed to implement HUD's program effectively. In 2003, HUD will replicate the 2001 survey to determine how partners' satisfaction has changed over time.  Employee satisfaction will increase from the 2002 baseline by 2008. In the spring of 2002, HUD conducted a Web-based OAS. The survey was designed by the Office of Personal Management to measure HUD employees' satisfaction with their workplaces. The survey measured personal experiences, job satisfaction and 17 dimensions of organizational climate that are key to high performance (balancing work and family life, leadership, teamwork, fairness). The survey was complemented by results from 22 focus groups at eight HUD locations nationwide. The OAS results will be used to set priorities in the areas that were identified as needing improvement, to help develop new performance goals and to create plans that focus on the areas where HUD can achieve the greatest progress through 2008 to address key organizational concerns. The 2002 OAS will be the baseline against which HUD measures progress in employee satisfaction and its transformation into a high performing organization.  The satisfaction of HUD partners with the Department's performance, operations and programs increases. In 2001, HUD published the results of a survey of key HUD partners concerning their satisfaction with the  46  HUD Strategic Plan   Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management and Accountability  Intermediate Measures Supporting this Goal  The number of noncompliant financial management systems decreases.  Complete assessment of HUD financial systems by FY 2004.  Achievement of milestones for implementing the FHA integrated financial management system by 2006. o o o o Implement the U.S. Standard General Ledger and credit reform accounts; Implement automated funds control processes; Automate FHA's interface with HUD's departmental general ledger; Eliminate manual accounting processes.   Achievement of milestones in the RHIIP process and interim targets for error reduction. o o o o o Complete regulatory simplification; Develop structured forms and tools for rent determination; Complete training for rent determination; Implement automated tenant data sources for rent determination; Implement risk-based monitoring of housing providers.   Implement actions including a communication assessment, to address challenges raised in the 2002 Organizational Analysis Survey by 2004 and 2007.  Complete follow-on Organizational Analysis Survey by 2005 and 2008.  Complete a comprehensive, strategic workforce plan in 2004.  Complete an integrated human resources/training/workforce management system (HIHRTS) in 2005.  External Factors The large number of HUD agents and grantees implementing HUD's programs in the field greatly complicates monitoring and performance measurement. For instance, the assumption underlying the distribution of grants by formula is that local decisionmakers are best positioned to respond to local housing needs and market conditions, and that local choices of activities that should be funded produce the most effective results.  HUD Strategic Plan  47   48  HUD Strategic Plan   Strategic Goal  Promote Par ticipation of Faith-Based and Community Organizations ""Faith-based and community groups are a force for tremendous good  but we know they could do so much more to help ease the suffering in our neighborhoods. And so we are tearing down the barriers and opening the door of opportunity for America's `armies of compassion.' They are eager to serve; we are offering them every encouragement."" -Secretary Mel Martinez  Overview In January 2001, President Bush created the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives and charged it with lifting up this nation's charitable service organizations and encouraging their good works. Roadblocks--including outright bias, arbitrary and burdensome regulations and general confusion over the way the federal government has addressed the separation of church and state--often have prevented HUD and other federal agencies from expanding its partnerships with America's faith-based groups. HUD's goal is to break down the barriers and substantially strengthen and expand its partnerships with faith-based and community groups to take full advantage of their capacity to provide quality services to communities and families. faith-based institutions have lacked access to information, critical networking contacts and complete capacity to be successfully eligible to receive federal funding.  Objective FC2: Conduct outreach to inform potential partners of HUD opportunities. Faith- and community-based organizations, large and small, can play a significant role in helping HUD to achieve its core mission. Among other assets, many of these organizations have a detailed knowledge of the needs of low-income communities and the trust of lowincome residents. Led by its Center for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives (CFBCI), HUD will reach out to groups--especially the smaller grassroots organizations that tend to be excluded--and help them with educational seminars, technical assistance and other services. By increasing the involvement of faith-based and community organizations in HUD's programs, HUD intends to provide higher quality services to the nation's communities.  Objective FC1: Reduce regulatory barriers to participation by faith-based and community organizations. HUD's activities under this objective will help to maximize full participation by faith-based and community-based organizations, by identifying regulatory barriers that inhibit participation and by assessing procurement and other internal policies and practices. Although HUD enjoys a long history of partnering with faith-based and community groups, many have been at a disadvantage. Some have been required to strip themselves of their religious identity and to separate their faith from their good works. In some instances, other impediments have either prohibited or discouraged participation by faith-based and community organizations. Additionally, some smaller grassroots and  Objective FC3: Expand technical assistance resources deployed to faithbased and community organizations. One of the constraints faced by faith-based and community nonprofit organizations is a lack of capacity to expand their operations to effectively implement new programs or absorb new increments of funding. Expanding technical assistance to these organizations will help increase their professionalism and efficiency as they benefit from the lessons learned by larger HUD Strategic Plan 49   Promote Participation of Faith-Based and Community Organizations  organizations. Training will include topics of capacity building, resource development strategies, the importance of generating partnerships and strategic planning.    Expanding technical assistance to faith-based and community groups, many of these groups are served through HUD's capacity building grants; Expanding outreach and field development; Publicizing successful programs of faith-based service delivery relevant to HUD's mission, with the aim of encouraging other groups to use these programs as a model; Facilitating the formation of partnerships between formula grantees of HUD (community development and public housing officials) and local faith-based and community grassroots organizations; Creating pilot programs within each of HUD's principal operating units (Housing, PIH, CPD) for the purpose of demonstrating the potential of faithbased and community grassroots organizations to advance the mission of HUD; Designating faith-based liaison officers at the regional and field offices to advance the Initiative within a local context; Building partnerships between the federal government and corporations, foundations and nonprofit organizations, including the Corporation for National Community Service.     Objective FC4: Encourage partnerships between faith-based/community organizations and HUD's traditional grantees. The goal of utilizing faith-based and community grassroots organizations to advance the mission of HUD ultimately hinges on the extent to which these organizations are able to access resources at the local level. HUD annually awards on the order of $2 billion in competitive grants for which nonprofit organizations are eligible. By comparison, $6 billion is potentially available through the CDBG and HOME programs--and more still through PHAs. Some local government entities may have limited experience in working with nonprofit, community-based service providers, and so the CFBCI will play a leading role--initially in a few target cities--in bringing together local government and community organizations to discuss the unmet needs of the community and the capacity of faith communities to respond to those needs. Additionally, the CFBCI seeks to encourage access to local funds by creating a greater transparency of the grant making processes. To this end, HUD will publicize the local grant opportunities, the points of contact and examples of recent grants to faith-based and community grassroots organizations.          Means and Strategies A number of specific strategies have potential to help match some of the vast resources of the federal government with the vision, commitment and expertise of community-based religious and voluntary organizations that are on the frontlines. Planned activities include the following:   Eliminating regulatory language that creates unnecessary barriers for faith-based groups; Eliminating or modifying requirements that are not mandated by statute or regulation and act as impediments;  HUD established the CFBCI in compliance with Executive Order 13198. CFBCI will partner with the comparable centers at the Departments of Education, Justice, Labor and Health and Human Services to advance the Initiative. Among other activities, the Center will:  Plan and conduct interagency events and conferences designed to educate and train faithbased and community organizations on equal access issues and partnership opportunities; Launch pilot and demonstration projects that bring program resources and other resources of these agencies together to serve faith-based and community organizations. These will include establishing a resource center and interagency Web site for the Initiative. Specific areas for which interagency coordination is planned beginning with FY 2003 include HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency program and HUD's activities in Colonias, homelessness and predatory lending.    50  HUD Strategic Plan   Promote Participation of Faith-Based and Community Organizations  Performance Measures Long-Term Performance Measure HUD will assess its long-term success in achieving this goal by measuring the following outcome discussed below:  Participation of faith-based and community-based organizations in HUD programs increases, as evidenced by the number of grant applications for and partnerships in HUD programs.  Participation of faith-based and community-based organizations in HUD programs increases, as evidenced by the number of grant applications for and partnerships in HUD programs. One measure of HUD's success in making programs accessible to faith-based and grassroots community organizations is the number of grant applications these groups submit to HUD. The number of grant applications submitted each year represents the effective demand for federal resources by grassroots organizations, as well as a threshold level of capacity.  The organizations demonstrate a higher threshold of capacity when they are able to submit applications that are qualified and competitive enough to merit grant awards. Further, as faith-based and community-based organizations are educated about HUD housing and community development programs, HUD expects increased participation of these organizations as partners in its programs. By FY 2004, HUD intends to establish a baseline number of applications submitted by faith- and community-based grantees and to set a target for improvement. By FY 2005, HUD intends to establish a mechanism for tracking other participation in HUD programs and to set a target for improvement.  Intermediate Measures Supporting this Goal    Establish a baseline number of applications by faith- and community-based grantees and a target for increased participation by FY 2004. Create recording mechanisms for analyzing competitive grant applications for faith-based groups by FY 2004. Create recording mechanisms for analyzing formula grant applications for faith-based groups by FY 2005.  External Factors More than 85 percent of HUD funds are distributed to local governments and PHAs via block grants, contract renewals and vouchers. Faith-based and community organizations are typically eligible as sub-recipients for some of these HUD funds but must apply through their respective local governments. While HUD can encourage certain uses of funds, and while funds are targeted to low- and moderate-income residents as the primary beneficiaries, each jurisdiction makes its own decision about how to use block grant funds.  HUD Strategic Plan  51   52  HUD Strategic Plan   Aligning Resources with Results This section provides in-depth background information on three key aspects of HUD's implementation of this plan: the budget and staff resources that are aligned with each Strategic Goal; the interagency partnerships that contribute additional resources and strategies; and the program evaluations and performance information that are crucial to budgeting for results. HUD will enhance coordination with the major banking regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Association, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, HUD will work with the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and state attorneys general on joint enforcement actions.  HUD also will continue to work cooperatively with these five regulatory agencies to collect data under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is the governing board that is responsible for collecting and disseminating this information. HMDA data show how mortgage credit is provided across the country and are invaluable in assessing disparities in lending practices among mortgage lenders that affect underserved groups. HUD will continue to work with agencies such as the Department of the Treasury to address predatory lending. The Interagency Task Force on Predatory Lending consists of federal law enforcement and banking supervisory agencies jointly seeking solutions to the problem of predatory lending. HUD cooperates with the Department of Justice to enforce fair housing laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of minority status or disability. HUD also serves on the Interagency Task Force on Fair Lending, whose members include the Departments of Justice and the Treasury, the FDIC, Federal Housing Finance Board, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Trade Commission, National Credit Union Administration, Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision. The Task Force coordinates fair lending activities across all federal agencies. Under a plan approved by the Federal Housing Finance Board, HUD formed a new partnership with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Seattle to buy up to $100 million in loans guaranteed by HUD under Title VI of the Native American Housing and Self Determination Act. HUD guarantees of principal and interest will help create an incentive for other financial institutions to extend financing to Native American communities.  Budget and Staff The Department's ability to achieve the targets set forth in this Strategic Plan depends on the level and allocation of budgetary and human resources. HUD strives to allocate resources efficiently by evaluating programs, consulting with stakeholders and measuring performance. HUD has instituted a series of measures to increase accountability and performance. One such measure is the adoption of resource management methodology. HUD has implemented the Total Estimation and Allocation Mechanism (TEAM), an online tool for measuring the allocation of staff resources. TEAM provides several benefits for the Department:   Estimating resources for budget formulation, execution and analysis; Linking resources to performance measures specified in the Annual Performance Plan under the Government Performance and Results Act; Validating and monitoring actual resource utilization.        Interagency Partnerships In addition to private partners and state and local governments, HUD relies extensively on other federal agencies to help accomplish its mission. The interagency cooperation that is planned during the period covered by this Strategic Plan is summarized for each strategic goal below.  Strategic Goal: Increase homeownership opportunities  Ginnie Mae will continue to guarantee mortgagebacked securities backed by pools of mortgages that are insured by the FHA and the Department of Agriculture's Rural Housing Service (RHS) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). To implement and enforce the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) effectively,      HUD Strategic Plan  53   Aligning Resources with Results  Strategic Goal: Promote decent affordable housing  HUD will continue to work with the Department of the Treasury to ensure efficient use of the LowIncome Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). HUD has done significant research on the tax credit program to inform LIHTC policy. HUD sets the maximum LIHTC rents by publishing estimates of 60 percent of area median income, and identifies Difficult Development Areas and Qualified Census Tracts-- areas where tax credits can be taken on a higher percentage of a project's ""qualified basis."" HUD's Office of Housing continues to work with Treasury to make the LIHTC program work better with FHA insurance. HUD also works closely with Treasury on tax-exempt bond regulations and other tax policy rulings that affect the continued provision of quality multifamily housing with affordable rents. HUD recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the RHS of the Department of Agriculture. The purpose of this MOU is to ensure an ongoing working relationship between HUD and the RHS in preserving affordable rental housing in rural America. The MOU will facilitate the processing of Multifamily Housing Assistance Payment contract renewals for RHS-financed projects. HUD will work with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy in a partnership that supports the goals of the President's National Energy Policy by promoting more widespread use of EnergyStar products in HUD's inventory of public, assisted and insured housing. HUD and the Federal Housing Finance Board signed a MOU in 1999 that sets forth the policy for approving the use of FHLB Affordable Housing Program (AHP) funds for subordinate financing of Section 202 and Section 811 projects. The need for a policy was prompted because sponsors of these properties were increasingly approaching FHLBs for AHP subordinate financing, for a variety of reasons. The MOU streamlined the approval process and decreased the time it takes for financing to become available for these projects, which house elderly and disabled persons. HUD will continue to work closely with a number of federal agencies, including the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Labor, to ensure the successful implementation of welfare reform policies designed to help low-income families make progress toward self-sufficiency. HUD serves on the Interagency Committee on Supports for Low-Income Workers, promotes the HUD Strategic Plan  HHS Assets for Independence competitive grant program through HUD's communications mechanisms and assists HHS in its technical assistance program for state welfare agencies, including through technical assistance conferences and broadcasts. HUD also encourages HUD-funded employment and training programs as well as subsidized housing providers to: (1) establish and maintain Neighborhood Networks centers for the implementation of such programs; and (2) coordinate and partner with the Department of Labor's national system of One-Stop Employment Centers.  HUD has worked with HHS to develop guidance and a model cooperative agreement for public housing agencies (PHAs) and local welfare agencies. PHAs are encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements with local welfare agencies to target services and assistance to welfare families who receive housing assistance and to reduce fraud and noncompliance with program requirements. HUD and HHS work collaboratively to increase the availability of assisted living facilities for low-income seniors, especially through coordination with states that have Medicaid waivers and can spend Medicaid funds on assisted living services. HUD signed a MOU with the FDIC to establish a national partnership to promote financial education using Money Smart, FDIC's financial education curriculum. FDIC is sending an educational package to over 4,000 PHAs across the United States, as well as to HUD's Public and Indian Housing Directors and Coordinators. The curriculum may be used in HUD-sponsored programs such as Resident Opportunities and Self-Sufficiency, Family SelfSufficiency and Welfare to Work vouchers.            Strategic Goal: Strengthen communities  Through the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, an Administration-wide effort to better support the work of faith-based and community organizations, HUD and four other agencies are working to coordinate a national effort to strengthen the capacity of faith-based and other community organizations to better meet the social and economic needs in America's communities. HUD is a member of the Interagency Council on the Homeless. The other federal Departments represented on the Council include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, HHS, Justice, Labor, Interior, Transportation and VA, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Government Services      54   Aligning Resources with Results  Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, the National Corporation for National Community Services and the Postmaster General. The Council coordinates federal programs supporting homeless families and individuals to minimize duplication and improve overall results.  HUD will continue to work with the Departments of HHS and VA to better integrate HUD housing for homeless persons with HHS and VA service resources. The three agencies will continue to sponsor policy academies with state agencies to bring senior state and local policymakers together to discuss how to improve access to mainstream federal service programs by persons who are homeless. HUD's Office of Native American Programs coordinates Native eDGE, an interagency initiative designed to facilitate sustainable economic development within American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Native eDGE includes a telephone call center, a publications clearinghouse, a Web site and a technical assistance information center. The Web site links 18 federal agencies, tribes, Native Americans, lending institutions, nonprofits, foundations and private businesses through a single portal so they can collaborate to promote sustainable economic growth in Indian country. HUD is a member of the Interdepartmental Task Force on HIV/AIDS and is collaborating with the White House Office of National AIDS Policy and other federal agencies in addressing the challenges from the HIV epidemic. These efforts will involve the coordination of training and technical assistance for providers of housing, health care and other social services for persons with HIV/AIDS. In addition, HUD is collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a study of the connections of homelessness or stable housing to HIV transmission and the progression of HIV disease, to assist CDC in gaining understanding and help prevent HIV transmission. HUD works with the Department of Justice and the EPA to enforce the Lead Disclosure Rule of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, which requires that landlords and sellers of housing constructed prior to 1978 provide each purchaser or tenant with information about lead hazards. HUD is working on the Healthy Homes Initiative with the CDC, the EPA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the National Institute of Science and Technology and the National Institute of Environmental Health    Sciences. Under the initiative, HUD awards grants to public and private organizations and makes agreements with other federal agencies for evaluation studies and demonstration projects to address housing conditions responsible for diseases and injuries. HUD is continuing joint research with the Federal Emergency Management Agency that will help reduce the risk and economic impacts of floods.  Strategic Goal: Ensure equal opportunity in housing  HUD chairs the President's Council on Fair Housing, which is an interagency group committed to promoting equal opportunity in mortgage lending, and serves on the Interagency Task Force on Fair Lending, which coordinates enforcement of fair lending laws across the federal government. Through the Interagency Task Force on Fair Lending, HUD works with the Departments of Justice and the Treasury, the FDIC, Federal Housing Finance Board, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Trade Commission, National Credit Union Administration, Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift Supervision to provide guidance to lenders consistent with the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and their implementing regulations. The Interagency Working Group on Limited English Proficiency (LEP), chaired by the Office of the Assistant Attorney General Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, consists of representatives from all Federal Civil Rights offices. The group is working together to ensure effective and efficient implementation of Executive Order 13166 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as it relates to LEP issues. The Group will ensure that persons with limited English proficiency will have meaningful access to funded and federally conducted programs and activities. HUD and the Department of Justice continue to coordinate their fair housing enforcement activities, especially with respect to responding quickly and effectively to Fair Housing Act complaints that involve criminal activity (e.g., hate crimes), a pattern and practice of housing discrimination, or the legality of state and local zoning or other land use laws or ordinances. HUD will continue to work with the Departments of Justice and the Treasury to ensure that LIHTC projects are in compliance with the Fair Housing Act. Under a MOU, the three agencies formalized a monitoring and compliance process to ensure that HUD Strategic Plan 55               Aligning Resources with Results  low-income housing tax credit properties meet the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.  HUD is partnering with HHS to help states and communities comply with Olmstead v. L.C. by providing community living options for persons with disabilities. In the pilot initiative, HUD is supplying vouchers and technical assistance, while HHS, working through state Medicaid agencies, is providing Nursing Home Transition Grants, Medicaid funds and other resources to facilitate the transition to community living. As part of the Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities, HUD proposed and designed a national pilot project implemented in 1999 to learn how federally supported service programs might better lead to employing adults with disabilities, especially adults who are members of racial, ethnic and language minority communities.  organizations on partnership opportunities, launch pilot and demonstration projects and build partnerships between corporations, foundations and nonprofit organizations. The Corporation for National Community Service will also play a role, and the Department of Agriculture will also be invited to participate.    Strategic Goal: Embrace high standards of ethics, management and accountability  HUD will continue to rely on the Department of Justice to accept civil referrals of multifamily development owners who have troubled management. Criminal referrals are sent to HUD's Inspector General. HUD will continue to show leadership in housing and community development policy by supporting cooperative research efforts. These include the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients (involving HHS, along with a number of other agencies); an Interagency Agreement with the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice to evaluate drug elimination strategies; and coordination with the Department of State to enter into MOUs to facilitate information exchange with counterpart housing officials from other countries. HUD continues to participate in the interagency FedStats task force to facilitate electronic data dissemination. FedStats is intended to provide an interagency clearinghouse for statistical data that will transform existing information searches from a fragmented, agency-focused process to a more unified and customer-oriented one.      Strategic Goal: Promote participation of faith-based and community organizations HUD's CFBCI will partner with the Centers for FaithBased and Community Initiatives at the Departments of Education, HHS, Justice and Labor to plan and conduct interagency events and conferences. The conferences are designed to educate and train faith-based and community 56 HUD Strategic Plan   Aligning Resources with Results  Policy Development, Program Evaluations, Related Research HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) has launched a long-term research planning process designed to provide a solid foundation for future policy development. The process involves identifying and anticipating the key housing and community development issues likely to face the nation in 2010 or 2020 and then structuring a long-term research agenda to inform the development of policies that can have a major impact in addressing these issues. PD&R is also conducting a series of internal policy reviews of key issues and HUD programs to develop shorter-term policy options that HUD and other agencies can use to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. HUD program evaluations and research, including copies of recently issued reports, may be found on the Web site for PD&R: www.huduser.org.6  Strategic Goal: Increase homeownership opportunities  Increasing minority homeownership. The President has established an ambitious goal to create 5.5 million more minority homeowners by 2010. In support of this objective, PD&R has initiated studies of the reasons for the racial and income gaps in homeownership and the early homeownership experiences of low-income families. Work in this area is being expanded to include topics such as the extent of any supply-side constraints on lower income homeownership opportunities and the effectiveness of policies and programs aimed specifically at boosting minority homeownership and helping low-income and minority families to remain homeowners. Affordable housing goals for GSEs. PD&R research and analysis supports the review and establishment of new affordable housing goals for the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These goals play a significant role in ensuring that the GSEs do their part to expand homeownership opportunities for low-income and minority families. Among other activities, PD&R will analyze newly available census data to revise the areas classified as ""underserved"" for the purposes of the affordable housing goals. Prior analyses have provided the foundation for establishing the GSE housing goals to ensure that the institutions do their utmost to help make housing affordable. Evaluations of HUD homeownership programs. To better understand the impact of HUD homeownership programs and determine how they can be improved, PD&R will initiate or continue work on a number of program evaluations, including evaluations of Housing Choice Voucher homeownership, homeownership activity under HOME, FHA single-family insurance and programs that concentrate homeownership investments in particular neighborhoods. Past research in this area has led to significant improvements in HUD's homeownership programs. For example, an evaluation of the FHA assignment program led to  Evaluation Strategy PD&R is in the process of substantially increasing program evaluation activity to support an Administration-wide effort to carefully evaluate the performance and impacts of government programs, including HUD programs. PD&R's ability to carry out this expanded level of program evaluation activity will depend on the availability of adequate appropriations. Based on input from the Secretary and program offices within HUD, PD&R is developing a program evaluation plan to ensure that evaluations advance key policy objectives and that major HUD programs are reassessed at regular intervals. While PD&R regularly evaluates each of HUD's principal programs, there currently is no fixed timetable that dictates specific intervals for evaluating a particular program. Rather, decisions about when to evaluate programs are made on the basis of input from the Secretary, program offices and PD&R, in light of current policy needs, recent program experience and budget constraints. While early implementation evaluations and impact evaluations are generally conducted for significant new programs, most evaluations of mature programs focus in depth on particular issues that need research.      Evaluation and Research PD&R currently has an active docket of program evaluations and related research designed to help improve program performance and inform the Department's policy development process. This section describes, by strategic goal, HUD's recent and ongoing program evaluations and related research by PD&R, as well as the impact that certain prior research projects have had on HUD policy. Additional information on 6  Additional research and evaluations are conducted by HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. Information on the work of this Office may be found on the internet at: http://www.hud.gov/offices/lead.  HUD Strategic Plan  57   Aligning Resources with Results  termination of that program and institution of new FHA loss mitigation tools. PD&R analysis also has contributed to the development of mortgage scorecards for use in FHA's automated underwriting and to the restructuring of FHA mortgages insurance premiums.  Providing essential data on homeownership and other housing issues. A significant portion of PD&R's budget is dedicated to funding major ongoing housing market surveys that provide critical data on the state of the nation's housing stock and markets. These surveys include the American Housing Survey, the Residential Finance Survey, the Survey of New Home Sales and Completions, the Survey of Market Absorption and the Survey of New Manufactured Homes Placements. Building technology. PD&R will undertake research to explore new approaches for production, rehabilitation and maintenance of housing to enhance affordability and energy efficiency. Other areas of needed research include expanded research in support of modernization of the Manufactured Safety and Standards Act, research on the needs of special users including the disabled and the elderly, energy research and technological research to support HUD's own assisted housing programs. RESPA analysis. Since the passage of RESPA in 1974, PD&R has helped to shape its implementation and enforcement. PD&R economists have worked to help the Department simplify and improve the mortgage origination process so that consumers can benefit from lower settlement service prices. PD&R will help the Department evaluate comments on the proposed RESPA rule, prepare a final rule and assess its impact. Reducing closing costs. Closing costs contribute to the upfront cost of buying a home, but there is little empirical work in this area because of the lack of a useful database. PD&R is currently creating a database of FHA mortgages that can provide reliable information on closing costs for the nation as a whole, for each of the 50 states and for certain cities and metropolitan areas. Analysis of this database will help to inform policymaking on strategies for reducing closing costs. Predatory lending. PD&R will continue its analysis of the subprime lending market to help policymakers distinguish between legitimate subprime lending activity that helps to expand homeownership opportunities for low-income and minority families, and predatory lending that takes advantage of these families. PD&R will also examine the role of mainstream lenders in our inner cities. HUD Strategic Plan  Strategic Goal: Promote decent affordable housing  Regulatory barriers to the production of multifamily and single-family housing. State and local regulations operate as a significant barrier to the production of affordable housing. Various studies estimate that construction and development costs can be reduced as much as 35 percent through new regulatory tools and processes. PD&R research will help policymakers better understand the nature and effects of these barriers and options for overcoming them. Among other impacts, past research has identified opportunities for streamlining rehabilitation codes to stimulate greater rehab activity to preserve existing housing. Additional research topics under consideration include regulatory barriers in the form of land use, building code and other regulatory impediments and opportunities to reduce the cost of land and infrastructure--the fastest rising component of housing costs. Development and evaluation of new strategies for expanding access to affordable housing. These include strategies for facilitating access to financing for construction and land acquisition and expanding access to information on the availability of land suitable for the development of affordable housing. Improving the quality and management accountability of public and assisted housing. PD&R is working to help improve management of public and assisted housing, including a crosscutting analysis of housing quality in HUD's various rental housing programs--public housing, Housing Choice Vouchers and the project-based Section 8 program. Strengthening the Housing Choice Voucher Program. PD&R has a long-standing research program focused on evaluating and improving the voucher program, which is HUD's largest affordable rental housing program. Among other things, PD&R plans to mine the wealth of research on Housing Choice Vouchers to distill lessons for states in implementing the new Housing Assistance for Needy Families program. Helping HUD-assisted renters make progress toward self-sufficiency. PD&R is presently evaluating a number of programs designed to advance this objective, including: the Family SelfSufficiency Program; the Welfare-to-Work Housing Voucher program; the Jobs Plus program; and the Moving to Opportunity Program. PD&R is also closely analyzing HUD administrative data to establish a benchmark for assessing the efficacy of                  58   Aligning Resources with Results  future efforts to increase the incomes of families in public and assisted housing. Work on these priorities will continue in future years.  Other affordable housing topics under consideration. Other program evaluations under consideration for FY 2003 and beyond include: an evaluation of assisted living conversions and other initiatives to appropriately house the aging elderly; a study of the Housing Choice Voucher administrative fee structure; a study of landlord relations in the Housing Choice Voucher program; a study of the outcomes for people leaving housing assistance; and a study of the factors leading owners to opt out of the project-based Section 8 program and the effectiveness of policies to preserve this housing stock. Ending chronic homelessness. PD&R is actively engaged in research designed to support the Secretary's goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten years. Projects include researching effective strategies for meeting the needs of on-the-street homeless individuals and evaluating the effectiveness of HUD-funded permanent housing for persons with disabilities. Preventing homelessness. To effectively address the challenge of homelessness, it is essential to focus on preventing families and individuals from becoming homeless in the first instance. To help develop more effective policies for preventing homelessness, PD&R will be researching the causes of homelessness, with a focus on procedures for discharging individuals from various publicly funded institutions, including jails and mental health institutions. Improving the usefulness of the Consolidated Plan. PD&R is actively involved in the Presidential Management Agenda goal of streamlining the Consolidated Plan and making it more useful to communities. Among other activities in FY 2003, PD&R will help to assess the efficacy of pilot strategies to streamline the consolidated planning process and help improve the usefulness of data that HUD provides communities for use in analyzing housing and community needs through the development of improved geographical information systems (GIS) templates. Evaluating the formulas for distributing HOME, CDBG and other Funds. PD&R will analyze the impact of new census data on formulas for distributing HUD funding, including HOME and CDBG funds, as well as HIV surveillance data for Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS   funds, to determine whether changes to these formulas are necessary to ensure the effective targeting of HUD funds. Improving the lives of residents of the Colonias. PD&R is engaged in an ongoing research effort to support the Secretary's goal of helping to improve the lives of residents of the poor areas along the U.S.-Mexico border known as ""Colonias."" Among other things, PD&R's research program is designed to better understand the nature of the problems faced by residents of the Colonias and analyze policy options for addressing these problems. State of the Cities Data Base. PD&R maintains and updates the State of the Cities Data System, which provides community and economic development practitioners with a centralized source of a variety of economic, demographic and housing data. Practitioners and researchers use the data system to track local conditions in cities and suburbs across the nation.    Strategic Goal: Strengthen communities   Strategic Goal: Ensure equal opportunity in housing  Housing discrimination. PD&R has an active research program designed to better understand the extent and nature of housing discrimination. Activities include a major study of the extent of housing discrimination in 2000 in the rental and homeownership markets (funded through the Fair Housing Initiatives Program, or FHIP). This study will update an earlier major study conducted in 1989, which found a substantial amount of differential treatment of minorities seeking to buy or rent housing and led to the authorization for the FHIP. PD&R also is developing pilot testing methods for detecting housing discrimination against persons with disabilities and conducting the first-ever assessment of housing discrimination against Native Americans. Another recent study assessed the level of public awareness of the fair housing laws. PD&R will continue to support the efforts of FHEO in this area in coming years. Housing accessibility. PD&R research helps to assess compliance with accessibility standards and to develop strategies for making the marketplace more aware of those standards. A recent study found that most new multifamily properties comply with some of the accessibility standards, but few comply with all of them.          Strategic Goal: Embrace high standards of ethics, management and accountability  Program evaluation activity. In an effort to strengthen the accountability of HUD programs for results, PD&R plans to substantially increase HUD Strategic Plan 59   Aligning Resources with Results  funding for HUD program evaluations in FY 2003 and future years. Based on input from the Secretary and program offices within HUD, PD&R will develop a plan for program evaluation activity to ensure that it advances key policy objectives and leads to regular periodic evaluations of major HUD programs.  Research specific to performance management and the Government Performance and Results Act. PD&R will continue its research program to improve HUD's ability to measure the direct effects of HUD's programs. The American Housing Survey, program evaluations and special-purpose research efforts provide and validate performance data about program impacts. Reducing errors in income and rent determinations. PD&R supervises periodic evaluations of the income and rent determinations of HUD's rental assistance programs to gauge the magnitude of errors and develop recommendations for reducing them.    Strategic Goal: Promote participation of faithbased and community organizations  Building the capacity of faith-based and grassroots nonprofits. Prior research by PD&R identified the lack of organizational capacity as a key obstacle to the funding (or expansion of funding) of many smaller nonprofit groups active in the housing and community development areas, including faithbased groups. Future research in coordination with HUD's Center for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives will assess effective strategies for strengthening these groups' capacity and will identify improved criteria for assessing capacity among smaller groups.  60  HUD Strategic Plan   Appendix The appendix briefly covers four areas: (a) what HUD does and whom HUD serves; (b) the performance management cycle at HUD; (c) an assessment of major economic, social, demographic or other trends outside the Department with a potential to impact achievement of the Department's goals; and (d) the key statutes that govern HUD's operations.  Promote participation of faith-based and community organizations by removing the regulatory barriers that discourage these organizations from partnering with HUD.  Whom Does HUD Serve? HUD has more than 9,000 employees and 81 field offices, with a presence in all 50 states, the nation's capital and Puerto Rico. Here are a few examples of the people and communities that benefit from HUD's programs:  Through the Federal Housing Administration and Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), both part of HUD, families who otherwise could not afford homeownership are helped in achieving that part of the American Dream. Millions of Americans--disabled individuals, the elderly, individuals with HIV/AIDS and people who were once homeless--receive HUD rental assistance, enabling them to afford a decent place to live. Through expansion of its successful Section 8 homeownership program, the Bush Administration is committed to helping more families move from renting to owning. Every state and more than 1,000 cities receive Community Development Block Grants, and a large portion also participate in the HOME Investment Partnerships and other grant funding, helping them to meet locally defined needs for housing, community development and basic services.  About HUD Mission HUD's mission is to increase homeownership, support community development and increase access to affordable housing free from discrimination. To fulfill this mission, HUD will embrace high standards of ethics, management and accountability and forge new partnerships--particularly with faith-based and community organizations--that leverage resources and improve HUD's ability to be effective on the community level.    What Does HUD Do? By working closely with other federal agencies and branches, as well as with local governments, faith-based and community organizations and the private sector, HUD provides a coordinated and comprehensive response to America's housing and community development needs. Among the key activities of the Department are to:  Increase homeownership opportunities by fighting predatory lending, simplifying the homebuying process, helping HUD-assisted renters become homeowners and insuring loans for first-time and low-income homebuyers to increase access to the benefits of homeownership. Promote decent affordable housing by expanding access to affordable rental housing, improving the physical quality and management of public housing and increasing housing opportunities for vulnerable populations. Strengthen communities by eliminating chronic homelessness, mitigating housing conditions that threaten health and providing grants to communities to help meet locally defined needs for housing, economic development and infrastructure. Ensure equal opportunities in housing by resolving discrimination complaints swiftly, promoting public awareness of fair-housing laws and improving housing accessibility for persons with disabilities.        To fulfill its mission, HUD works closely with Congress and other federal agencies, and builds partnerships with local governments, faith-based and community organizations and the private sector. HUD's headquarters staff and field offices work with cities, counties, states, lenders, nonprofits and members of the housing industry. HUD strives to make its programs efficient and flexible. In FY 2002, Congress approved a budget of more than $31 billion for HUD programs.    HUD Strategic Plan  61   Appendix  The Performance Management Cycle at HUD This section briefly describes how HUD uses the Strategic Plan. The diagram shows the integrated set of strategic planning and performance management tools that HUD uses to produce results. Together, the tools ensure better planning and accountability for results consistent with HUD's mission.  HUD's Strategic Planning and Performance Management Cycle Strategic Plan  Each year HUD develops and submits an Annual Performance Plan (APP) to Congress in conjunction with the President's Budget to identify the performance goals and results HUD intends to accomplish during the year with the resources in its budget request. The APP establishes the specific performance measures that will help us gauge progress in achieving the strategic goals and objectives articulated in the Strategic Plan. The FY 2004 APP will be submitted to Congress in February or March 2003. Once Congress acts on HUD's budget proposal for a fiscal year, all HUD organizations, both in headquarters and the field, establish annual Management Plans to ensure the day-to-day management processes and program operations support the achievement of the measurable results contained in the APP. The field office plans identify the coordinated strategies and actions each office will implement to respond to local needs and to contribute to the achievement of the goals and objectives articulated in the APP. In addition to the internal HUD Management Plans, the President prepares a Management Agenda with HUD that includes specific action items. The first iteration of the President's Management Agenda (PMA) was announced in conjunction with the FY 2003 budget submission in early 2002. Progress in achieving milestones in both the internal Management Plans and the PMA is tracked on an ongoing basis and reviewed at Executive Management Meetings held monthly by the Deputy Secretary with principal staff. In addition, beginning in FY 2003, the Secretary will hold quarterly meetings with principal staff to review progress in achieving key APP indicators and meeting implementation milestones. These progress reviews and the results of ongoing oversight of field operations provide essential information for appropriate corrective actions and policy adjustments to ensure performance goals are achieved. At the end of the fiscal year, HUD prepares a Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) that reports on HUD's performance in the prior FY and the extent to which HUD achieved the goals of the APP. The FY 2002 PAR will be submitted to Congress in February 2003. The annual process of planning, budgeting, managing and reporting on performance will go through several cycles during the life of this Strategic Plan. The longer Strategic Plan cycle is completed when information about results, including program evaluations, is combined with stakeholder input to inform and shape Departmental strategies for a revision of the Strategic Plan.  Annual Performance Plan  Budget  Management Plans & Program Delivery Systems  Results  Quarterly Review of Key Indicators Annual Performance & Accountability Report  The Strategic Plan, the initial step in this performance management cycle, defines the strategic goals and objectives for the Department's work and establishes a vision of what HUD seeks to achieve during the next six years. Agencies are required to submit a new Strategic Plan to Congress at least once every three years. The last Strategic Plan was submitted in the fall of 2000.  62  HUD Strategic Plan   Appendix  Perspective and Outlook An essential element of a strategic overview of HUD's role is an assessment of major economic, social, demographic or other trends outside the Department with a potential to affect achievement of the Department's goals. Several aspects of the nation's economy and demography are worthy of note because of their current or potential impact on HUD operations.  Welfare Reform Many HUD tenants also receive income from welfare. Some HUD-assisted tenants have done well under welfare reform, moving completely from welfare to work or increasing their earnings. The long-term budgetary impact for HUD and housing providers is still being evaluated.  Economy The ability of families to afford their housing costs is strongly influenced by the economy, and in particular, by interest rates and unemployment levels. Unemployment rates rose during the recent recession but are expected to decline as the economy recovers. Family incomes declined slightly in 2001 according to the Census Bureau. Interest rates are currently low, which is a driving force in making homeownership affordable for more families. An increase in interest rates could slow the growth in homeownership.  Devolution and Local Control The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 continued the trend toward devolution of responsibility for HUD's housing programs, delegating more authority to state and local housing agencies. HUD's ability to achieve its goals is heavily contingent on the performance of its partners. Local jurisdictions have local authority to create building codes and zoning requirements. Through this authority, jurisdictions often create regulatory barriers that prevent the development of affordable housing or lead to increased costs.  Housing Markets On a national basis, rental vacancy rates are at or near record high levels. Even so, there are some markets, for a variety of reasons, including the additional burden of compliance with state and local regulations, where affordable housing is less available.  Demographics Continuing growth in the elderly population during the coming decade will create new demand for housing that is appropriate for elderly families, including assisted living opportunities. There is a growing population of Hispanic households in the United States, including many new immigrants. The ability of these households to access mainstream housing resources may be impacted by language barriers, discrimination and (in some cases) lack of credit history. The 1999 Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C. required states to place persons with disabilities in community settings rather than institutions when treatment professionals determine that community placement is appropriate. This decision affects the need for accessible housing and housing linked to supportive services.  HUD Strategic Plan  63   Appendix  Key Statutes The Department of Housing and Urban Development is the Executive Branch Agency, established by Congress, whose chief responsibility is the implementation and enforcement of federal housing and community development statutes passed by Congress. Through the years, Congress has passed legislation that not only created the programs that HUD is responsible for administering, but also established HUD's overall goals and mission. While there have been a multitude of programs established by Congress over the years, the goals and mission of the Department have generally focused on the need for innovative and comprehensive solutions to housing and community development problems, an emphasis on HUD's service to disadvantaged individuals and distressed neighborhoods and a reliance on partnerships as a means to achieve results. The following is a list of key statutes that define HUD's mission: 1934 National Housing Act: Created the Federal Housing Administration ""to encourage improvements in housing standards and conditions (and) to provide a system of mutual mortgage insurance."" United States Housing Act of 1937: Created the public housing program. Housing Act of 1949: Established grant programs to assist state and local governments with community planning and urban renewal.

Housing and Community Development Act of 1974: Created Community Development Block Grants for state and local governments ""to promote the development of viable urban communities"" and also established Section 8 rent subsidies for low-income families. Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA): Required that the costs of real estate settlement services be disclosed to the consumer and forbade the payment of referral fees, kickbacks, splits of fees and unearned fees for these services. RESPA governs almost every individual residential mortgage transaction involving a mortgage loan in the United States. Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act: Created the housing voucher program as an addition to Section 8 rent certificates and repealed authority to make new commitments under the Section 8 project-based program. Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act and the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988: Created new programs to assist the homeless.

Also established the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons With Disabilities program and the HOPE programs. Housing and Community Development Act of 1992: Established the Youthbuild and Low Income Housing Preservation and Homeownership programs. Also created a comprehensive lead paint hazards reduction program, HUD risk-sharing programs with housing finance agencies and GSEs and the Indian housing loan guarantee program. Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act: Strengthened HUD's regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two housing governmentsponsored enterprises regulated by HUD, to improve access to affordable housing for verylow-, low- and moderate-income families and families living in underserved areas. The Act established the framework by which HUD establishes the level of three housing goals that the GSEs are required to achieve annually.

In 2001, Congress extended M2M and OMHAR through 2004. Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (a.k.a. Public Housing Reform Act): Made significant changes in the public housing and Section 8 tenant-based programs. Substantially deregulated high-performing public housing authorities, decreased poverty concentrations in public housing and promoted mixed-income communities, ensured that a threshold share of units and housing vouchers remain available for the truly needy and created incentives for residents to become selfsufficient. VA-HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999: Increased FHA's single-family loan limits, giving HUD the opportunity to provide more affordable mortgages to first-time, minority and central-city homebuyers, and substantially amended FHA Single Family Property Disposition requirements. Preserving Affordable Housing for Senior Citizens and Families into the 21st Century Act: Enabled HUD to develop a broad range of housing options to meet the changing housing needs of senior citizens, and authorized Markup-to-Market, which protects low-income renters by minimizing the number of owners that choose to opt out of the project-based housing assistance program. VA-HUD Appropriations Acts: For FY 1999, Congress approved 50,000 new housing vouchers to help individuals and families with worst case housing needs and help families move from welfare to work. This was the first significant appropriation of new vouchers for the Department since FY 1994. For FY 2000, Congress approved 60,000 new vouchers, demonstrating renewed commitment to reduce the severe shortage of affordable housing.  1997  1990  1998  1992  1992  1998  1999  1992  1999 2000  1994  HUD Strategic Plan  65   Appendix  2000  American Homeownership Opportunity Act: Expanded opportunities for low-income including the disabled, senior Native Americans.  and Economic homeownership Americans, citizens and  2000  Community Renewal and New Markets Initiative of 2000: Encouraged economic development in low- and moderate-income rural and urban communities.

Reverse mortgages are a special type of home loan that lets a homeowner convert the equity in his/her home into cash.  They can give older Americans greater financial security to supplement social security, meet unexpected medical expenses, make home improvements, and more.

Answer: HUD helps people by administering a variety of programs that develop                and support affordable housing. Specifically, HUD plays a large                role in homeownership by making loans more readily available for                lower and moderate income families through its FHA mortgage insurance                program and by making HUD Homes available. HUD/FHA does not make                loans or grants to homeowners. All of the HUD/FHA insured mortgage                loan programs are handled through HUD-Approved mortgage lenders.

Answer: A Title I loan is a FHA-insured home improvement loan which can                be used for the alteration, repair, or improvement of an existing                single family structure; preservation of an historic residential                structure listed or eligible to be listed on the National Register                of Historic places; or alteration, repair or improvement of an existing                manufactured home and/or mobile home classified as personal property                or real estate. A Title I loan can also be used to finance the purchase                of a new or used manufactured home on an installment contract. Title                I home improvement loans are typically offered as 2nd mortgage loans                and are available up to $25,000. Loans for purchase of a manufactured                home are available up to $48,600 for the home only and $64,800 for                the home and lot combined. A title II loan is a FHA-insured 1st                mortgage loan that a borrower can use to help purchase a home as                a primary residence. Title II loans are available under a number                of programs, including the popular Section 203(b) program which                many first-time buyers use to buy a new or existing one-to-four-family                home; the Section 203(k) program which allows borrowers to purchase                or refinance and rehabilitate their residence if the home is a least                one year old; and the Section 234(c) program for borrowers interested                in purchasing a condominium residence.

Answer: HUD doesn't operate and rent housing directly. But HUD does                fund three kinds of local housing assistance that might help you:                                                Public housing, which is low-income housing operated by your local                  housing authority:           Section 8 in which the housing authority gives the tenant a certificate                  or voucher that says the government will subsidize your rent payments.                  You must find your own housing; and                                       Privately owned subsidized housing, where the government provides                    subsidies directly to the owner who then applies those subsidies                    to the rents he/she charges low-income tenants. Contact your                    local public housing agency for more information about public                    housing and Section 8 certificates and vouchers and how you                    to apply for these programs. If you're interested in privately-owned                    subsidized housing, you will need to check directly with the                    management office of rental agencies, which can be found in                    the classified section of your local newspaper.

Back to Top                                         Question: What is the ""Good Neighbor Partnership                    Initiative"" that HUD recently announced? Can I buy a home                    under this program?                                          Answer: This initiative is geared to placing more vacant single-family                    foreclosed homes owned by HUD into the hands of local governments                    so they can put them to use. Under the new initiative which                    goes into effect on May 1, 2000, any FHA-held property on the                    market for longer than six months will be offered to local governments                    for a nominal amount. Local governments will decide how the                    properties are to be used and who they will be sold to. They                    can be fixed up and sold to the public, given to nonprofit                    agencies that deal with housing problems on a daily basis, or                    torn down so the land can be put to better use. All HUD wants                    is that they be used to meet broad public needs.

This                nation owes its veterans a tremendous debt, for their sacrifices                have made America strong and able to take on its aggressors. When                a veteran joins the military, the federal government makes a contract                with them that they will be cared for, and that is a promise the                government will keep. Veterans who need our help must know that                we will not turn our back on them.                For                more than half a century - predating the creation of HUD itself                - the federal government has worked specifically to meet the housing                needs of this nation's veterans. After World War II, HUD's Federal                Housing Administration's mortgage insurance teamed up with the Department                of Veterans' Affairs' (VA) mortgage guarantees to help returning                veterans achieve the American Dream and buy their own homes, which                they did in record numbers. Since HUD's creation in 1965, we have                sought to improve housing opportunities for America's veterans by                ensuring a coordinated federal response.                At                least 600,000 people in this country are homeless on any given night.                VA estimates that more than a quarter million are veterans; of those,                approximately 80 percent are disabled. Each year, half a million                veterans find themselves without a home at some point.                Many                of these veterans have special needs or face extreme personal circumstances                that propel them in and out of homelessness. Many have nowhere to                go except back out on the streets when they are unable to access                homeless shelters or transitional housing. Their lives are revolving                doors that again and again return them to homelessness.                In                July, in a speech before the National Alliance to End Homelessness,                Secretary Martinez endorsed the goal of investing in permanent solutions                to end chronic homelessness within ten years. The Bush Administration                is reactivating the Interagency Council on the Homeless as a first                step.                The                Council was established in 1987 to help streamline Washington's                approach to homelessness by coordinating the efforts of 16 federal                agencies and other designated groups. Yet, the full Council has                not met in more than five years. We will put it back to work: planning                and coordinating federal homeless programs, reducing duplication,                recommending improvements, and offering assistance to our partners                at the community level.                VA,                of course, is a primary resource for homeless veterans, and we commend                Secretary Principi and his department for the exceptional service                they provide. HUD and VA share a number of crosscutting responsibilities;                for example, both agencies maintain separate programs that provide                housing and supportive services to veterans. With this new emphasis                on cooperation, we pledge to better coordinate with our counterparts                at VA and other federal agencies in order to serve the homeless                veteran population more efficiently and effectively.                Working                with national service organizations, HUD established HUDVET, a resource                center for veterans through which we provide information on community-based                programs and services, with an emphasis on veterans who are homeless.                At the suggestion of veterans groups, an individual with special                knowledge of veterans' needs - who is himself a combat-disabled                Vietnam veteran - oversees the HUDVET program.                As                the federal government's primary provider of targeted homeless assistance,                HUD has the lead federal role in finding homes for the homeless.                That is appropriate: we have 36 years of experience in helping Americans                find safe and affordable shelter. HUD's homeless funding represents                nearly three-fourths of all targeted federal homeless assistance.                               Veterans                assistance projects funded by HUD fall into one of two categories:                those projects that primarily serve veterans, and those projects                that target veterans as one of any number of key populations to                be served. In 2000, HUD funded 68 projects targeted specifically                to veterans, and another 1,348 projects that in some way supported                veterans. Based on grantee reports submitted to HUD for 1999, HUD's                homeless assistance programs served more than 160,000 homeless veterans.                It is important to point out that veterans may have been counted                more than once, if they were served by more than one HUD program                during the reporting period.                HUD                continues to reach out to veterans and veterans' organizations in                our grant applications by stressing the importance of serving veterans.                In both the 2001 Continuum of Care Notice of Funding of Availability                and the 2001 Continuum of Care application, applicants are asked                to target veterans.                The                FY 2002 budget for HUD demonstrates a strong support of homeless                veterans. In FY 2002, a total of $1.12 billion is provided for homeless                assistance grants and shelter plus care renewals. This will fund                four major programs, which I would like to briefly outline for the                Committee:                SUPPORTIVE                HOUSING PROGRAM . The Supportive Housing Program provides funds                to develop supportive housing and services that allow homeless persons                to live as independently as possible. Funds offer up to 24 months                of transitional housing, and permanent housing for persons with                disabilities.                SHELTER                PLUS CARE . The Shelter Plus Care program provides rental assistance                for homeless persons with disabilities. This is a form of permanent                housing.                SECTION                8 MODERATE REHABILITATION FOR SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY (SRO) DWELLINGS                FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS PROGRAM . The Single Room Occupancy                program provides rental assistance on behalf of homeless individuals                through the moderate rehabilitation of SRO dwellings.                EMERGENCY                SHELTER GRANTS . HUD will provide approximately $150 million                in Emergency Shelter Grants for FY 2002. These grants are used for                the rehabilitation or conversion of buildings into homeless shelters,                as well as related social services, operating expenses, homeless                prevention activities, and administrative costs.                HUD                administers a number of other programs that reach out to veterans                and their families. These include HOME Investment Partnerships,                Title V, Community Development Block Grants, Homeownership of Single-Family                Homes and the Section 8 Homeownership Program, Lower-Income Rental                Assistance, Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly, Section                811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, and Federal                Housing Authority Mortgage Insurance Programs.                The                department has initiated an effort to develop and disseminate information                especially for organizations serving homeless veterans. This effort                includes developing guidebooks and holding conferences at which                HUD provides technical assistance information. We conducted one                of these technical assistance programs last month in Baltimore;                the next is scheduled for Santa Fe in November.                In                the coming years, HUD will make the goals of preventing homelessness                and ending chronic homelessness as high a priority as that of housing                the already homeless. We can do this by ensuring that individuals                who pass through mainstream social services - such as the mental                health, welfare, and criminal justice systems - do not move out                of those services and back into homelessness. HUD administers a                number of programs that touch the ""potentially"" homeless, and we                will work to highlight their availability and usefulness to our                grantees.                Mr.                Chairman, I appreciate your leadership in calling this hearing,                and I thank the Committee for its willingness to focus on this important                issue. HUD looks forward to working together with the Committee                and the appropriate federal agencies to combat homelessness among                our veteran population.                                                                                                                                                                                   Content updated September 20, 2001                                                                                                                                    Back to top                                                                                                                U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home"

HUD's Homeless Assistance programs are                broken down into two main categories,  formula                 (non-competitive), and  competitive .                Competitive programs are under the umbrella of Continuum of Care.                                             Competitive Programs                 The                McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act programs administered by                HUD that award funds competitively require the development of a                ""Continuum of Care"" system in the community where assistance                is being sought. A continuum of care system is designed to address                the critical problem of homelessness through a coordinated community-based                process of identifying needs and building a system to address those                needs. The approach is predicated on the understanding that homelessness                is not caused merely by a lack of shelter, but involves a variety                of underlying, unmet needs - physical, economic, and social. Funds                are granted based on the competition following the  Notice                of Funding Availability (NOFA) .

HUD doesn't give you the loan directly. You'll need to go to a local HUD-approved lender, who will help you find out if one of HUD's programs is right for you. But, you can learn about HUD's mortgage insurance programs right here!                HUD's FHA Loan   If you're interested in a buying a home and you meet our credit   qualifications, you may be eligible for a low down payment of 3   percent.   On a $50,000 home, that's a downpayment of $1,500, compared   with $5,000 - $10,000 for most conventional loans. You also can wrap your   closing costs and fees into the mortgage.      HUD-insured loans are available in urban and rural areas for single   family homes and for 2-unit, 3-unit, and 4-unit properties      To get a HUD-insured loan, you need to apply to a HUD-approved bank,   mortgage company, or savings and loan association for your mortgage.               HUD-Insured Loans for Rehabs        HUD insures loans to rehab and make improvements on one- to four-unit homes that have been completed for at least one year.  You may be eligible if you are an owner. There is no upfront mortgage insurance premium.  Loans range from under $5,000 to a maxim  um of $25,000.                                                     HUD-Insured Loans for Special Credit Risks      In some cases, HUD insures loans for people who have had credit trouble and do not meet standard credit requirements to buy low cost homes.  Down payments can be as low as 3 percent, and closing costs can be wrapped into the mortgage.                HUD-Insured Energy Efficient Loans   If you are buying or refinancing a home and you'd like to roll the cost of improvements to make the home more energy efficient into your mortgage, HUD's Energy Efficient Mortgage Insurance Program may be for you. The cost of the energy efficient improvements that may be eligible for financing is the greater of 5 percent of the property's value (not to exceed $8,000) or $4,000.          HUD-Insured Loans for Condominiums      HUD insures loans to buy to buy or refinance a principal residence in a condominium development.  Down payments can be as low as 3 percent, and closing costs can be wrapped into the mortgage.       HUD-Insured Loans for Disaster Victims      If you have lost your home as a result of a natural disaster, you may be eligible for a HUD-insured loan.  For home disaster loans, no down payment is required.     The President must have declared your community a natural disaster area in order to qualify.      HUD-Insured Reverse Mortgages for Elderly Homeowners      HUD provides mortgage insurance to elderly homeowners to convert the equity in their homes into monthly income and/or a line of credit to be repaid when they no longer occupy the home.

Its economy was thriving ¾  creating a healthy supply of well-paying jobs and a strong housing market. While these dynamics were celebrated by city boosters, politicians, and residents, they had a negative side ¾  increased homelessness. The problem was caused by a combination of factors, including the tight housing market; an in-migration of poorer, lower skilled residents seeking jobs; and other more subtle factors that the city leaders were unable to disentangle completely. Having witnessed the experiences of older cities where homelessness problems had become significant, political, business, and community leaders decided to forge a strategy to address this emerging issue.  City leaders held a summit of government officials; community groups; homeless housing providers, care providers, and advocates; foundation representatives; and members of the housing industry to discuss homelessness. The result of the summit was the formation of a community-wide planning process to develop a comprehensive  Continuum of Care  system to address the growing problem. The city integrated this planning process with its efforts to conduct housing and homelessness needs assessments and a housing market analysis, as required for its Consolidated Plan. The first step of the planning process was to assess the extent of homelessness and the needs of homeless people in the community. Once this was completed, the community evaluated how it had been responding to those needs. The evaluation revealed that some organizations were addressing the issues, but their efforts were not coordinated in any significant way. Moreover, many of the organizations needed help to increase their capacities to deal with issues. The community then took the third stepdesigning a way to meet the needs of homeless people. HUDs  Continuum of Care  programs for homeless individuals and families were viewed as a strong source of support for meeting these needs.   The first step in implementing the homelessness strategy was to improve the provision of emergency shelters. The city used its formula-based  Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG)  funds to set up a homelessness prevention program that paid rent for persons receiving eviction notices and increased the service capacity of an over-burdened emergency shelter system. Emergency shelters were only a temporary fix, however. They did not address long-term housing needs, nor did they tackle the problems that lead to homelessness. To address some of these needs, a local nonprofit  applied for funding from the  Supportive Housing Program (SHP)  to provide both transitional housing and support services to help the homeless overcome some of the problems that made them homeless, such as lack of jobs and poor health. SHP funding also enabled the nonprofits to assist the homeless in obtaining permanent housing. The public housing agency helped by assisting a private, nonprofit owner of a deteriorating single-room-occupancy facility to acquire a  Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy (SRO)  grant. The grant provided rental subsidies to the owner of the facility for homeless individuals renting units that were rehabilitated by the owner. The owner used a portion of the rental assistance to help pay for the debt incurred for the rehabilitation. As a by-product of the homelessness planning process, community leaders also recognized a housing issue that the community had not addressedthe enforcement and awareness of fair housing laws. Although housing discrimination did not appear to be a major problem, some community leaders were concerned that the continuing influx of Hispanic immigrants might cause discrimination to become an issue. Discrimination did not seem to be a major cause of homelessness, but it did relate to the availability of housing for minorities, which could impact the extent of homelessness and overcrowding. The community felt that increasing awareness and enforcement of the issue would be a useful tool in the overall housing strategy; however, no qualified fair housing enforcement organizations existed in their region. Community leaders convinced a qualifed fair housing enforcement organization from outside the community to apply for a  Fair Housing Initiatives Program Fair Housing Organizations Initiative  grant to create a new fair housing enforcement organization to conduct fair housing activities in their region.                                                                                                        Content updated December 5, 2000                                                                                                                                                                Back to Top                                                                                                    U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home

The President                has stressed that all of us, in both the public and private sectors,                have a responsibility and a moral obligation to make welfare reform                work. The President has said, “Above all, we must harness the                private sector to bring jobs and hope to our hardest-pressed neighborhoods.”               The                Welfare to Work program requires Federal agencies to directly hire                individuals off the welfare rolls. While the program does not require                Federal contractors to do likewise, the Federal procurement community                can certainly help with this initiative. To that end, you are urged                to consider hiring current welfare recipients. (Please note that                under certain contracts, Federal acquisition rules permit the Government                to reimburse Federal contractors for costs incurred in training                personnel, if those costs are related to the job for which the individual                is hired.

GX261-29-6584403	"Dear Colleague: The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities invites you to join a ""listserve"" we have formed for the purpose of distributing information and sharing ideas on the interrelationship of affordable housing policy and welfare reform. (If you would prefer to receive copies of selected documents by mail, we invite you to join our conventional mailing list, described below.) The Center is a nonpartisan research organization and policy institute that conducts research and analysis on a range of government policies and programs, with an emphasis on those affecting low- and moderate-income families and individuals. One area of interest to the Center is the intersection of lowincome housing and welfare policy. The Center's research in this area seeks to clarify the implications of welfare reform for housing policy and the potential contribution of housing programs to welfare reform. LISTSERVE: To facilitate the exchange of information on the nexus of housing and welfare policy among housing and welfare professionals, researchers and policy analysts, policymakers, and foundation representatives, the Center has formed this listserve. Subscribers to the listserve will receive periodic updates from the Center on issues related to the intersection of affordable housing policy and welfare reform and will be able to send information or pose questions to the Center or to the subscriber list. Among the topics that we expect will be discussed on the listserve are: initiatives that help subsidized tenants find and retain work, the implications of the new housing bill for welfare reform efforts, and state and local programs that provide housing allowances to families attempting to move from welfare to work. We encourage those with e-mail access to sign up for the listserve. If you do not have e-mail access, but do have occasional access to the Internet, you may find selected publications on housing and welfare reform (and other topics of concern to low- and moderate-income families) on the Center's web site: http://www.cbpp.org. MAILING LIST. For those who would like paper copies of selected Center publications on the intersection of housing and welfare reform, we are setting up a conventional mailing list. Subscribers to the housing/welfare reform mailing list will receive at least six mailings a year. To partially cover the copying and mailing costs, the conventional mailing list will carry a $25 fee. (Subscribers to the listserve need not sign up for the conventional mailing list. All documents sent to the mailing list will be made available without charge to listserve participants in electronic format.) Some recent Center papers on issues related to the nexus of affordable housing policy and welfare policy are available on the Internet at: http://www.cbpp.org/pubs/housing.htm. A brief description of several recent papers may be found at the end of this document. The housing/welfare reform mailing list should be distinguished from the Center's general subscription service, which costs $55 and covers such areas as federal budget issues, poverty and income trends, labor issues, hunger and welfare issues, and state policy issues. The housing/welfare reform mailing list provides access to papers that are in most cases too specialized and technical to be sent to the general subscription list. (For more information on the general subscription service, or to sign up, contact the Center at 202-408-1080 or visit: http://www.cbpp.org/pubs/subsc.htm.)   TO SUBSCRIBE TO LISTSERVE. To join the listserve, take the following two steps: 1. Send an e-mail to majordomo@lists.cbpp.org containing this exact message: subscribe housingwelfare 2. So that we know who has joined the listserve, we would appreciate it if you sent a second e-mail to housing@cbpp.org indicating that you have joined the listserve and providing the following information: a. name d. phone number b. organization e. fax number c. e-mail address f. address  MAILING LIST. To join the conventional mailing list on the intersection of affordable housing policy and welfare reform, send a letter providing items a-f above, together with a check for $25 payable to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, to the following address: Housing/Welfare Reform Mailing List, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 820 First Street, NE, Suite 510, Washington, DC 20002. Please send any questions by e-mail to housing@cbpp.org or by mail to the above address.

Revised November 1998. (http://www.cbpp.org/hous212.htm). This paper provides an overview of the issues at the intersection of welfare reform and low-income housing policy and the extent to which this intersection presents both opportunities and risks for welfare recipients, housing and welfare advocates, and administrators of welfare and housing programs. The paper describes a number of areas where better understanding and improved coordination between welfare and housing programs could prove particularly useful. The paper is useful for people seeking to gain familiarity with low-income housing programs or basic provisions of new federal and state welfare laws. HOW THE STATUTORY CHANGES MADE BY THE QUALITY HOUSING AND WORK RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1998 MAY AFFECT WELFARE REFORM EFFORTS. December 1998. (http://www.cbpp.org/12-17-98hous.htm) This paper discusses the potential impact of the new housing bill on welfare reform efforts. As discussed in the paper, most policy decisions by public housing agencies (PHAs) on matters relevant to welfare reform must now be recorded in a newly created document: the PHA Plan. We anticipate that the PHA Plan process, and the required public and tenant input into that process, will play an important role in determining many local housing policy decisions. WELFARE-TO-WORK HOUSING VOUCHERS: AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO WELFARE REFORM. Revised February 1999.

U.S.  ATTORNEYS JOIN HUD ENFORCEMENT CENTER     WASHINGTON  Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo today released a new report documenting the success of  a crackdown by HUD and the Justice Department on waste, fraud and abuse in HUD programs and joined Attorney General Janet Reno in announcing that four Assistant U.S. Attorneys are being assigned to HUD to strengthen the crackdown.     The report  titled HUDs Get Tough Initiative   details achievements of the partnership that Cuomo and Reno launched last March to act against landlords who are accused of  abusing federal housing programs to enrich themselves while failing to provide safe and decent low-income housing.  The achievements of the crackdown include an increase of over 300 percent in actions against landlords accused of wrongdoing.    Cuomo and Reno said HUDs new Enforcement Center will be strengthened by the assignment of four Assistant U.S. Attorneys to work in the Center for one year. The Assistant U.S. Attorneys are: Mack Cauley of Tampa; John Gant of Beaumont, TX;  Debrah Carnahan of St. Louis; and Jamie Mittet of Seattle. The Enforcement Center  which was created to lead HUDs crackdown on waste, fraud and abuse    is headed by FBI Special Agent Edward J. Kraus, who is also on detail to HUD.    The report on HUDs Get Tough Initiative found that:      HUD dramatically increased the number of debarment actions against bad landlords to 122 in 1997  an increase of over 300 percent from 1996, when just 30 landlords were subject to debarment action.  Debarments, which prohibit individuals and companies from doing business with federal agencies for varying numbers of years, can exact a heavy financial toll on businesses and individuals dependent on federal contracts for their income.      HUD and the Justice Department worked with the HUD Inspector Generals Office, the Treasury Department and state and local governments to nearly double the number of civil cases and settlements resulting in recoveries against landlords of HUD-assisted housing. The number of such cases grew to 46 in 1997  up from 24 in 1996.       HUD and the Justice Department recovered nearly $25 million in  money owed to HUD by landlords as a result of the above actions in 1997  up from about $18 million the year before.      ""Last March, Attorney General Reno and I promised our departments would work together to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse in HUD programs,"" Cuomo said. ""Our message today is simple: we have kept our promise by backing up our words with action.  We have saved American taxpayers millions of dollars, and we are continuing to carry out our zero-tolerance policy against landlords who try to rip-off Uncle Sam.""    ""Broken windows and graffiti-stained walls are a welcome mat for criminals,"" Reno said. ""By cracking down on landlords who pocket federal funds intended for repairs, we can save taxpayer dollars and also help cut crime in the process.""    About 4.3 million people with low and moderate incomes   many of them elderly and disabled  live in about 2.5 million privately owned HUD-assisted apartment units.   When landlords pocket HUD assistance that should be used to properly maintain apartments, poor tenants suffer.  Buildings can deteriorate badly  as broken windows, leaking plumbing and broken heating systems go unrepaired.  This lack of maintenance eventually causes vacancies and crime to increase in the HUD-assisted apartments, and often leads landlords to default on their mortgages.  Since the mortgages of HUD-assisted housing are insured by HUD, the Department gets stuck with the bill for the defaulted mortgages and for building repairs. If no enforcement action is taken, the landlord can walk away with big profits, abandoning responsibility for the project.    ""We know that most landlords of HUD-assisted housing are responsible and provide affordable housing as required under law,"" Cuomo said.  ""Our job is to identify and stop the minority who are abusing our programs.""    Cuomo and Reno spoke to a conference of U.S. Attorneys and other law enforcement officials from 13 cities who are part of a joint effort by HUD, the Justice Department and public housing authorities to reduce crime in public and HUD-assisted housing.  The cities are: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Greensboro (NC), Gary (IN), Kansas City (MO), Memphis, Newark (NJ), New Orleans, Philadelphia and San Francisco.      Cuomo, Reno and U.S. Attorney Zachary W. Carter announced the latest action in the crackdown  on bad landlords today  the indictment by a grand jury in New York City of five people accused of fraudulently diverting some of the $52 million in HUD rental assistance that went to Blackstone Realty Management Co. for eight low-income apartment developments in five states. (SEE SEPARATE RELEASE).    In addition to the crackdown on landlords who abuse HUD programs, the Get Tough report noted HUD progress against waste, fraud and abuse in other areas in 1997, including:       Cutting inflated subsidies to assisted housing under the Section 8 program, saving taxpayers $562 million this year and about $1.6 billion over five years.  At the same time, HUD worked successfully to get Congress to approve funding to renew all expiring Section 8 subsidy contracts.    Ending a reverse mortgage scam that swindled senior citizens around the country out of thousands of dollars each.     Protecting homeowners from unscrupulous contractors who overcharge for shoddy home repairs.     Preventing homebuyers from being overcharged by mortgage brokers.     Notifying consumers of millions of dollars in uncollected refund payments on their mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration.     Cracking down on housing discrimination  including a request in the 1999 HUD budget for a 73 percent increase in funds to reduce this discrimination.      HUD's Get Tough Initiative Report"

HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Congressman John Kasich of Ohio announced the new HUD Good Neighbor Policy today and said it is good for neighborhoods, communities and families.     Under the policy, single-family homes that are acquired in foreclosure actions by the Federal Housing Administration (which is part of HUD) will be eligible for sale to local governments around the nation for $1 each whenever FHA is unable to sell the homes for six months. About 3,000 homes will initially be eligible for sale to local governments under the initiative, with additional homes available for sale each month.     ""The Good Neighbor Policy will build better futures for hundreds of communities and thousands of families across our nation,"" Cuomo said. ""It will help reverse decades of decline in our cities by revitalizing neighborhoods, attracting new residents, and promoting homeownership.""    ""I think this policy is going to provide huge benefits for America and America's families,"" said Kasich, who is Chairman of the House Budget Committee. ""I hope there can be more instances when Members of Congress and officials from the Executive Branch can work together to develop and implement ideas like this one that achieve the common good.""    By selling vacant homes for $1 after six months on the market, HUD will make it possible for communities to fix up the homes and put them to good use at a considerable savings. The newly occupied homes can then act as catalysts for neighborhood revitalization, attracting new residents and businesses to an area.    Local governments buying HUD homes for $1 can sell or rent them to low- and moderate-income families, to first-time homebuyers, or to groups that will use the homes to provide services such as child care centers or job training centers.    Homes in extremely deteriorated condition, where rehabilitation is not feasible, will be demolished by HUD and the vacant lots will be offered for sale to the local government for $1.    The initiative won't cost taxpayers a penny. Because of improvements in FHA management and because few FHA-insured home loans default, FHA's revenues exceeded expenses and the agency returned about $1.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury in 1999.      The Good Neighbor Policy complements a system HUD instituted 10 months ago under which contractors rather than HUD employees sell FHA-owned homes. Under this system, the average time it takes to sell a home has dropped by 38 days and the amount of money HUD recovers from each sale has increased by an average of $4,500 per home. With more than 50,000 sales to date, the new system has saved HUD more than $225 million.     Cuomo credited Kasich with coming up with the idea for the Good Neighbor Policy, which HUD then developed into the plan announced today.    To launch the new initiative, Cuomo announced that the first house sold under the Good Neighbor Policy will go to Columbus, Ohio, which is represented by Kasich in Congress. Columbus will buy a three-bedroom house at 344 Midland Avenue for $1.     Thomas Cochran, Executive Director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said: ""This flexible use of HUD homes at virtually no cost is a great opportunity for cities and counties. We applaud Secretary Cuomo for developing this initiative. This is another great tool that will make a difference.""    FHA currently insures about 6.7 million mortgages. When homeowners fail to make their mortgage payments, FHA first tries to help them stay in their homes through foreclosure avoidance. If this is not successful, the lender forecloses on a home and conveys it to FHA in exchange for FHA payment of the outstanding mortgage balance. FHA then puts the home up for sale.    The vast majority of FHA-owned homes sell within six months. For example, in the past six months FHA has sold about 39,000 homes, while only about 3,000 homes have been on the market for six months or more.    Last year FHA sold about 6,500 homes to local governments and community-based nonprofit organizations through the Direct Sales Program. This program offers homes located within a revitalization area that are in need of repair for sale at 30 percent discounts off the appraised value. The program, which sells homes as soon as they become available to FHA, will continue.     HUD has implemented many reforms at FHA since Cuomo became Secretary. HUD has reorganized and consolidated 81 field offices into four state-of-the-art home ownership centers, approved and adopted Freddie Mac's and Fannie Mae's automated underwriting systems, and developed an FHA scorecard, which will be available to the marketplace later this year.     Eighty percent of FHA loans go to first-time homebuyers. In addition, FHA insures about 40 percent of all home mortgages to African American and Hispanic homebuyers.    FHA does not make mortgage loans directly, but rather insures loans made by private lenders to homebuyers. Because FHA mortgage insurance protects lenders from losses, it has enabled 30 million American families who would otherwise be locked out of the mortgage market and homeownership to qualify for mortgages.    FHA-insured loans also benefit homebuyers in these ways:       FHA downpayments of 3 percent are lower than the minimum that many lenders require for non-FHA mortgages. Higher downpayments are a major roadblock to homeownership.     FHA's requirement for homebuyer credit ratings are more flexible than those set by many lenders for non-FHA borrowers.     FHA permits homebuyers to use gifts from family members and non-profit groups to make their entire downpayment, while conventional loans generally require homebuyers to come up with a portion of the downpayment from their own funds.     FHA permits a borrower to carry more debt than a private mortgage insurer typically allows.      ##"

During that time, the region will be updated with the Tenant Reporting Optimum Compliance Phase II Release software. The Vendor Region will be available beginning on February 2nd and will include the new software. The Compliance Percent rate will be set to 10% in the Vendor Region to allow vendors to test both positive and negative cases without going through the extra exercise of creating a high volume of tenant data in the Vendor database.

System development enhancements for the Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) to implement the changes listed in the newly published Occupancy Handbook will take approximately 18 months. As a result, participants are directed to disregard matters requiring system enhancements, which effect contract renewals or the payment process. Specifically, participants are directed to continue using existing data formats under the existing 201B requirements to submit data to TRACS until further notice. The Office of Housing will hold a TRACS Industry meeting on July 28th and 29th 2003. At that time, potential system changes/revisions and future impacts will be discussed with Industry partners along with a proposed timetable for implementing Occupancy Handbook changes.   June 18, 2003  Changes to Download Option for TRACS On-line Web Applications Effective June 18, 2003, a minor change has been implemented affecting the Download option for various TRACS On-line Web Applications. Please note that when using this option, the delimiter has been changed from a comma ( , ) to a semi-colon ( ; ). These changes affect the download option for the following TRACS Internet Web Applications:      TRACS Certification Query TRACS Move-in/Move-Out Query TRACS Project Evaluation Query TRACS Tenant Unit Address Query TRACS Verification Query.  This fix was implemented to correct the dynamic display of the `Tenant Name' column for applicable web queries when the selected data contained a comma.   Posted May 9, 2003 Announcement ""Expired Baselines Permitted"" TRACS has removed the fatal edit, F0161. You may now submit baseline certifications having effective dates greater than 15 months and TRACS will store them with a new discrepancy. The new discrepancy, CE262, will replace F0161. When generated, the message will read: ""Baseline cert with an effect date more than 15 mos old was stored in TRACS."" Since it is assigned a priority code ""3"", it as an ""informational"" message only and no correction or further action is required. This new discrepancy will be added later to the TRACS Mat User Guide. The intent of this change is to enable delinquent projects to submit and store certifications in TRACS so that their associated vouchers may be paid more expeditiously.   Posted May 5, 2003  TRACS INDUSTRY MEETING TENTATIVE SCHEDULE The next TRACS Industry Meeting is tentatively scheduled for July 14th and 15th, 2003. Once a location is confirmed, this notice will be revised. .   Posted April 15, 2003 HOTLINE Hotline service has been temporarily discontinued but will be restored as soon as possible. Please fax TRACS critical issues to (202) 708-3985 and include your name, daytime phone number, and a detail description of the problem.   Posted March 31, 2003 Revised TRACS Voucher Fatal Error Message On 3/28/2003, a revised Voucher fatal error, VF002, was implemented in production. At the direction of Housing, this edit was modified to validate the submitted VCHHR -Voucher Header Record Subsidy Type against subsidy contract information in TRACS. The revised VF002 message is, ""Submitted Subsidy Type is inconsistent with the subsidy contract"". If your voucher was rejected with this error, then please verify the Subsidy Type submitted (VCHHR  Voucher Header Record - Field 17) is consistent with the subsidy contract that covers the voucher, and resubmit the voucher with the correct Subsidy Type. For additional information, please refer the TRACS MAT Guide.   Posted February 14, 2003 Announcement TRACS Tenant Certification Query TRACS is aware that users are experiencing problems with the Certification Query's ""Sort by Unit"" feature and the ""Tenant SSN"" query option. The ""Sort by Name"" is functioning correctly according to our understanding from users and our internal testing. TRACS Staff is working on solving these problems and a fix is expected soon. We will post an additional update announcement when a software correction for the query has been implemented for your use. Thank you for your patience.   Posted February 11, 2003 TRACS Error Messages TRACS recently discovered a situation where TRACS processing cycle messages are being returned to the wrong users. It was also discovered that, in some cases, duplicate messages were being returned. The problem has been isolated to a Sprint messaging process. TRACS is currently working with Sprint to correct this problem. In the meantime, TRACS has created a ""work round"" to prevent users from receiving the wrong cycle messages. New Section Added to TRACS MAT Guide TRACS has noticed a number of users who are having difficulty with or misunderstanding certain aspects of move-out (MO) and unit transfer (UT) submissions. To be helpful, TRACS has added an additional section to the MAT User's Guide, `TRACS Operating Tips'. This section includes some practical advice, for example, 'How to correct a move-out'. It also includes a matrix to help the user decide what to submit when a household becomes associated with a different unit within TRACS. We hope this new section will be of assistance. TRACS will continue to update this section through time. Also, a note referencing this new section has been added to the beginning of the ""MAT 10 Section 2: Basic Record"" and ""MAT 40 Move-out Record"" layout specifications of the MAT User's Guide so that new readers will become readily aware of how and when to submit a particular transaction record.   Posted February 6, 2003  TRACS ERROR MESSAGES A problem has been discovered where TRACS generated error messages are being returned to the wrong user. Since the implementation of TRACSMail, there are several channels though which data must pass. At this time, we are exploring every avenue to see where the problem exists. Additional information will be posted as the investigation progresses.   Posted February 5, 2003  (A revision of the announcement posted January 30, 2003) INVALID T-Ids  TRACS has identified a list (see below) of invalid Temporary Ids (T-Ids) that have been generated for some family members submitted to TRACS without Social Security Numbers (SSNs). None of these invalid ids were generated for a head of household. Because they are invalid, they may not be used and must be corrected. In order to correct any TRACS certification containing one of these invalid TIds, TRACS is asking that you resubmit any certification for which one of the T-Ids listed below was generated and stored in a TRACS certification. We recommend that these certifications be submitted as corrections with all 9s in the Identification Code field of the MAT10, Section 3 Family Member Record. When doing so, a new and valid T-Id number will be generated for the family member. However, if a member's SSN has been received since the original certification was submitted to TRACS, please use the actual SSN. In using an example, suppose a user, Ms. Brown, submitted a move-in last fall with all 9s for 2 children in the household. TRACS erroneously generated the same invalid T-Id (T16189002) for both children in the household. Later, when she submitted a MAT70 gross rent change, TRACS saw only one of the members sharing the invalid T-Id, and counted only one dependent. This erroneous dependent count caused a cascading effect of TTP/AP discrepancies for the household. The certification in TRACS is not correct due to the effect of the invalid T-ids. Now that the TRACS logic has been corrected so that only valid T-Ids are generated, Ms. Brown can correct the situation by submitting a MAT10 correction to the move-in with all 9s for the two children OR SSNs if they have been received. She would also need to resubmit the MAT70 gross rent change. The MAT70 should be resubmitted with the same head of household id used when the corrected MAT10 was submitted. A MAT70 gross rent change was used here as an example but the same corrective procedures should be applied to those certifications affected by MAT70 unit transfers, MAT40 move-outs and MAT65 terminations. The reason for re-submitting a MAT70, MAT40, or MAT65 is that the correction alone will be the most recent transaction its certification effective date and mask the effect of the other transactions submitted after the original certification but before the correction. If you have experienced a situation similar to the example above, submit a correction to the certification having the invalid T-Id. After submitting the correction, check TRACS via the Certification Query (""Certification History"" may be accessed by clicking the Tenant's name) and make sure that the correction was stored successfully. If any MAT40's, MAT65's, or MAT70's had been submitted after the original certification, they will have to be resubmitted after the MAT10 correction is stored.  Invalid T-Ids T03919011 T16189002 T18076003 T20319006 T30479009 T40639012 T46879004 T47224001 T49375003 T57039007 T67199010 T76593004 T83599005 T93759008   Posted February 5, 2003 ""Late Annual Recertifications"" TRACS has modified the logic to relax the fatal edit for late Annual Recertifications, and redefined lateness in terms of the submitted MAT10 transaction's voucher date and transaction effective date. Hopefully, this step will enable users having difficulty submitting late Annual Recertifications to successfully submit and store them in TRACS. These changes were implemented on January 28, 2003 as a result of a TRACS/Industry Conference Call discussion held on January 8, 2003. For more details about this change to Annual Recertifications, please go to the ""Tracs Documents"" page, and click the document link for ""Late Annual Recertifications"".   Posted January 30, 2003 INVALID T-IDs TRACS has identified circumstances under which invalid Temporary IDs (T-IDs) have been generated for some family members submitted to TRACS without Social Security Numbers (SSNs). The invalid T-IDs are listed below. In order to correct the TRACS database, TRACS is asking that you resubmit any certification for which one of T-IDs listed below was generated and returned. We recommend that these certifications be submitted as corrections. If SSNs have been received since the original certification was submitted to TRACS, please use the actual SSN. We apologize for this inconvenience.  Invalid T-IDs T03919011 T16189002 T18076003 T20319006 T30479009 T40639012 T46879004 T47224001 T49375003 T57039007 T67199010 T76593004 T83599005 T93759008   Posted January 16, 2003 New E-Mail Security Measures for Spam Mail The Office of the Chief Information Officer has been monitoring the recent increase in Spam mail at HUD. Spam mail is unsolicited Internet e-mail; generally illegal or inappropriate Spam mail, i.e. pornography or pyramid schemes. In response to this and complaints received from HUD staff about Spam mail received, effective January 20, 2003, HUD will augment infrastructure security measures in order to reduce the volume of Spam mail. HUD will subscribe to an e-mail abuse prevention system that will provide us with continuous updates of Internet Service Providers (ISP's) that are known or suspected Spam mail sites. E-mail messages from such sites will be returned to the sender indicating the recipient address was rejected. The returned e-mail will include the following language: Your email to HUD.gov was rejected because your site/organization is listed on an industry-standard e-mail abuse prevention service, to which HUD subscribes, as a potential SPAM mail site. If you believe your site has been incorrectly listed, your local e-mail administrator can click here http://www.mail-abuse.org/referred.html for more detailed information. This is the first phase of a two-phased approach to reducing Spam mail in the Department's e-mail system. While this phase will not eliminate SPAM mail completely, Spam mail in HUD, and the associated risks, will be significantly reduced. The next phase, to be implemented soon, will address other options and alternatives available to eliminating Spam mail. No action will be required by HUD staff for the implementation of the new Spam mail reduction procedures. However, as a pro-active measure, program areas are encouraged to notify business partners with whom they regularly conduct business via Internet mail to have their local e-mail administrator visit http://www.mail-abuse.org and follow instructions to check to see if the IP address(es) for their e-mail server(s) is currently listed. If so, the business partner's e-mail administrator should follow listed procedures for removal of their IP address from the service. If a HUD business partner or outside entity reports to you that e-mail messages they address to hud.gov have been rejected, Headquarters users should refer the business partner to the mail-abuse.org web site or call the Customer Services Division at 202-708-3300. Field users should contact their local IT staff or follow locally established procedures.   Posted December 17, 2002 Vendor Region Refresh As discussed at the TRACS Industry Meeting on December 9, 2002, TRACS will be purging the tenant and voucher data from the Vendor Region Database, used for testing user software. Also, the contract data, used for contract/project validation, will be refreshed with the production data. The purge/refresh process will be completed by December 30, 2002.   Posted December 5, 2002 Third Time's a Charm The location for theTRACS Industry meeting December 9 and 10, 2002 has again been changed. We will now be in B-180 and B-182 of the HUD building for both days (12/9 from 9-4:30 and 12/10 from 9-Noon). Sorry for any confusion -- but consider how this affects us! We hope to see you on Monday.   Posted December 5, 2002 TRACS/INDUSTRY MEETING AGENDA GSA Building 7th and D Street SW, Washington, DC 20410 (across the street from HUD Building at 451 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410)  December 9, 2002  9 am to 4 pm Welcome TRACS Outlook for FY 2003 Break BPR Overview/Discussion Lunch TRACS Maintenance Update Break Policy/Procedure Updates Wrap Up December 10, 2002  9 am to Noon Day 1 Q & A WASS Break TASS RHIIP Status Wrap-Up   Posted December 5, 2002 TRACS MAT User Guide Updates The following codes were added to the MAT Guide since October 1, 2002 TRACS Message Codes Added to MAT Guide CE243 CE244 CE245 CE246 CE247 CE248 CE251 CE252 CE253 F0074 F00163 F0231 F0232 F0233 HQ123 HQ124 HQ180 NA corrected to NA001 VF023 VF067 VF068 VF069 VSR30 VSR31 VSR52 .

Scroll down to see that announcement. The new discussion starts today.   Posted November 26, 2002 Verify Immigration Status The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is changing the manner in which owners/management agents verify immigration status of non-citizens under the SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) program from telephone to an automated system. A document titled ""HUD/Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Verification of Non-citizens Transitioning Progress"" is listed on the Documents page. Please pull the document and be ready for the change.   Posted November 20, 2002 TRACS Monthly Data Quality Review Initiated In the next few days you may be receiving informational messages resulting from a new monthly procedure that TRACS is implementing to identify data quality issues. The messages identify two different conditions in the TRACS database. The first condition identifies specific units with multiple active households in the TRACS database. The message identifying this condition is message code NA001. These are likely to be cases where a move out or a unit transfer wasn't submitted or was rejected by TRACS. The second condition identifies Heads of Households with active certifications in more than one unit. The units are not necessarily in the same project/contract. The message identifying this condition is message code SA001. The message will be sent to each site where the Head of Household has an active certification. It may be necessary to get your HUD Field Office involved in resolving some of these cases.   Posted November 13, 2002 TRACS DISCUSSION FORUM ALERT The new Web TRACS Discussion Forum will soon be available to TRACS users. At that time, users will be able to access the new forum from the Internet by clicking on the TRACS Home Page link. It is suggested that within the next two weeks, users retrieve any pertinent information they wish to retain from the current forum. The new forum will replace the old forum, but due to technical reasons, the old messages cannot be included in the new forum. The discussion will begin from the date of installation of the new forum.   Posted November 7, 2002 December TRACS/Industry Meeting The next TRACS/Industry meeting has been scheduled for December 9 and 10, 2002 in Room 10222, the Departmental Conference Room, 451 Seventh Street, SW. We have just been able to confirm these dates and sure hope that many of our `regular attendees' will be able to be with us.   Posted October 31, 2002 Update Announcement for ""New Fatal Edits for TRACS"" The ""New Fatal Edits for TRACS"" release scheduled for December 13, 2002 has been postponed indefinitely. ""New Change to Security Deposit Logic"" On October 8, 2002, TRACS eliminated the two fatal errors, F0221 and F0222, from the Security Deposit logic and replaced them with two discrepancies: CE252 (replaces F0221) and CE253 (replaces F0222). Since that change was implemented on October 8, it was decided to apply the CE253 discrepancy edit to the Rent Supplement Units and RAP Units. Therefore, the security deposit may not be less than $50 for Rent Supplements or RAPs. (This $50 edit was already applicable to 202 PRACs, 811 PRACs, and 202 PACs and will remain so.) This change will parallel the revised 4350 handbook requirements on Security Deposits. This change will be implemented soon in early November 2002. To be clear, since both edits are discrepancies and not fatals, neither one will reject your mat transaction. For more details about security deposits in TRACS, please go to the ""TRACS Documents"" page, and click the document link for ""Security Deposit Logic"".   Posted October 10, 2002  TRACS Discussion Forum Alive and Well The TRACS Discussion Forum is now available to TRACS users. Please be advised that sensitive and private information, such as a Tenants Social Security Number should NOT be posted to the Forum! Currently, the process for posting messages to the Forum is under a Security review. Be aware of the data you are posting to the Web to ensure that your data does not contain sensitive and private information. TRACS Batch Processing of Fatal Error Messages It was brought to our attention that TRACS Fatal error messages were not being generated and returned to the users. The Development team has researched and resolved the problem. As of 10/01/02, Fatal errors from the TRACS batch process are being generated and returned to TRACS users.   Posted September 25, 2002 ""New Security Deposit Discrepancies"" TRACS is eliminating the two current fatal errors, F0221 and F0222, from the Security Deposit logic. These fatals will be replaced with two discrepancies: CE252 (replaces F0221) and CE253 (replaces F0222). Implementation of this new change is expected soon after October 1, 2002.

Although you can now both send and retrieve messages and logon to Delegated Administrator, all messages sent to TRACMPROD and TRACMTEST are being rejected with the following error message: ERROR: TM002 - Email Rejected: Attachment(s) do not have SPRINT header information. Check email client settings, consult your software developer, or call the TRACS hotline. Data was not transmitted to TRACS. Attachments: Your email to TRACMPROD with subject: Subject had the following error: ERROR: TM002 - Email Rejected: Attachment(s) do not have SPRINT header information. Check email client settings, consult your software developer, or call the TRACS hotline If you received this error message either Monday or today, your files are not in error, it is the TRACSMail script that is in error. Please monitor this site for an announcement advising you when this problem has been corrected. Once it is fixed you will need to retransmit your files. We apologize again for the disruption in TRACSMail service.   Posted September 17, 2002 TRACSMail Update As of Tuesday morning 9/17/02 TRACSMail is fully operational again. You should be able to both send and retrieve messages and logon to Delegated Administrator and update your account information. If you should experience any new problems with TRACSMail you may report them to the TRACS Hotline at any one of the following numbers: Phone Fax Email 800-767-7588 202-401-7984 tracs_hotline@hud.gov  We apologize again for the inconvenience and disruption to your workflow caused by TRACSMail's erratic behavior this past week. We are hopeful that TRACSMail will remain stable in the future.   Posted September 16, 2002 TRACSMail Update As of Monday morning 9/16/02 the status of TRACSMail is as follows: 1. Users can retrieve messages in TRACSMail but get an error message when attempting to send messages. 2. Delegated Administrator is functioning properly which means users can proceed with updating their account information as previously instructed. Sprint is working on resolving the problem that is preventing the sending of messages and an announcement will be posted as soon as it is known when TRACSMail is fully operational again.   Posted September 12, 2002 TRACSMail Update As of 10:00 AM ET 9/12/02 TRACSMail appears to be operational for sending and receiving messages only. However, you may experience some degradation in performance due to the high volume of activity anticipated as a result of the system being unavailable for the last three days. Delegated Administrator is still generating the ""Invalid Credential"" error message when users attempt to log in. An announcement will be posted when Delegated Administrator is functioning again. Again, we are sorry for the inconvenience and will do our best to keep you updated.   Posted September 11, 2002 BOGUS MESSAGE FROM TRACMPROD.TRACSMAIL.HUD.GOV It was brought to our attention that the message below was sent to a certain internet email address indicating a from-address of tracmprod@tracsmail.hud.gov. Please be aware that TRACSMail is a closed email system and messages from or to tracmprod can only be sent on TRACSMail and are invalid on internet email systems. Please disregard this and any other messages to your internet email account appearing to come from TRACSMail.

We are working with Sprint to resolve the problem as soon possible. We are sorry for the inconvenience, and will keep you posted of the resolution.   Posted August 30, 2002 ""New Fatal Edits for TRACS"" TRACS announced on August 14, 2002 that it would postpone implementing ""New Fatal Edits for TRACS"" but retain the requirement to start storing all the reported values of a successful MAT10 submission. (Please see the Announcement for August 14.) We have a change to this announcement: We will postpone implementing most of those ""new fatal edits"" that were listed in the original announcement but implement 16 of them by December 13, 2002. The effort will still include TRACS storing the reported values (i.e., TTP, AP, Adjusted Income etc.), so that when you view tenants' certification list via the web Certification Query, you will see the reported values you submitted via the MAT transmission instead of the values that TRACS calculated. We have decided to postpone implementing most of those ""new fatal edits"" because it will be possible to implement them only when TRACS is reengineered. We have identified 19 discrepancies, which will be converted to 16 fatal errors. Please review the revised document listing these new fatals and give us your feedback. The document will give you more details. To find the document, please go to the TRACS ""Documents"" page, and click the document link for ""New Fatal Edits for TRACS"".   Posted August 14, 2002 Update to previous Announcement dated August 5, 2002 titled ""New Fatal Edits for TRACS and Discrepancies to be Eliminated"" The proposal to convert discrepancies to fatal errors, as expressed in the original announcement below of August 5, 2002, has been officially postponed to an indefinite date. Your comments convinced us to implement this requirement at a more opportune time. Most of those listed as proposed fatal edits will be retained; and your comments have helped to add, eliminate, or clarify edits for a modified list to be re-posted in the future. To all of you who responded - I appreciate your time and helpful insights. I trust this communication is helpful to you as well. However, TRACS will maintain one aspect of this requirement. We will store in the TRACS database, beginning on December 13, 2002, the user-reported values submitted via the MAT transmission instead of the TRACS-calculated values. So, once the MAT transmission passes all the fatal edits and is stored as a TRACS certification, all the stored data will be the reported values. TRACS will continue to perform its own calculations and post any discrepancies based on the differences between the reported values and the TRACS-calculated ones. But, all the stored and displayed data will be whatever was reported. Therefore, any report produced via the web Certification Query will display the MAT data reported by the user. The TRACS Certification Query is currently displaying the TRACS-calculated dollar amounts for the TTP and AP, for example, but that tradition will be changed by December. Again, if there are TTP or AP differences between what TRACS calculates versus what are reported, the reported value will be stored and a TTP or AP discrepancy will be generated and sent.   Posted August 14, 2002 New TRACSMail ID Request and Registration Form Now on Web Effective immediately, you do not have to call Aspen to obtain a TRACSMail ID Request and Registration Form. The form can now be downloaded from the HUD TRACS Document web page at http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/trx/trxdocs.cfm. Simply print the form, complete it, and fax it to the numbers provided on the form. You will be notified of your new TRACSMail ID and password either at the email address or fax number you provide on the completed form.   Posted August 5, 2002  Updated - see Announcement dated August 14, 2002.  ""New Fatal Edits for TRACS and Discrepancies to be Eliminated"" TRACS has identified a large number of discrepancy messages that will be converted into fatal error messages. Also, TRACS will add a few completely new edits as new fatal errors. The purpose is to change the way we evaluate certifications and select that data to be stored in the database. The result is that many of the certfications, now being recorded with discrepancies because the errors are discovered too late in the process to reject the transaction, will soon be rejected by fatal errors. One benefit is that a MAT10 record stored by TRACS as a certification will be more compliant with the business guidelines established by HUD's 4350 Handbook. Another benefit is that the number of discrepancies for O/As to correct and C/As or HUD to monitor. Up to now, TRACS has calculated 50059 values and compared them with what was submitted. If the calculated values differed from the submitted values, the TRACS calculated values were stored in the TRACS database. TRACS is changing this system philosophy. Values will still be calculated and compared, but many of the existing discrepancies will become fatal errors. In those cases where discepancy messages remain, the submitted values will be stored in the TRACS database. This goal was announced at the last Industry Meeting on June 5, 2002. At that meeting we had promised to post to the web the lists of the ""new fatal edits"" and ""eliminated discrepancies"" for your review. Please go to the ""tracs documents"" page, http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/trx/trxdocs.cfm, and click the document link for ""New Fatal Edits for TRACS and Discrepancies to be Eliminated"". If you want to respond with your suggestions, please do so by writing to one of our TRACS analysts, Denny Saulman. His e-mail address is: dennis_m._saulman@hud.gov The deadline for your comments will be Wednesday August 16, 2002. The implementation release date for this requirement has been set for December 13, 2002.   Posted August 5, 2002  Voucher Message Notice TRACS has determined that recent Voucher messages generated by TRACS have not been reaching the designated TRACSMail mailboxes. TRACS staff has worked with the other entities involved to resolve the problem. The problem has been resolved, and the messages have been resent.   Posted August 1, 2002 TRACS NO LONGER ACCEPTING 201A TRANSMISSIONS TRACS stopped accepting data transmissions in the 201A format on May 1, 2002. Several notices have been posted to the Web, as well as transmitted to users mailboxes via TRACSMail, alerting our users that TRACS will only accept data transmissions in the 201B format. Data submitted in the old format will not be processed. To date, TRACS continues to receive a relatively large number of transmissions in the 201A format. These transmissions will NOT be processed! Please ensure that your software is in the current 201B format! TRACS HOTLINE SERVICE RESTORED The TRACS Hotline is now available to TRACS customers. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please call the Hotline at 1-800-767-7588 if you have TRACS processing questions or issues.   Posted July 9, 2002 The TRACS Hotline continues to be unavailable for service. We apologize for the confusion on the Hotline email address. On June 20th, a message was posted to the TRACS Announcements Forum that anyone having TRACS processing questions or issues could send an email to TRACS_Hotline@hud.gov. Apparently, the full address was not made clear. If you are using this address, please ensure that there is an underscore between the words TRACS and Hotline. An alternative email address is TRACShot@hud.gov. A message was posted on July 3, suggesting this address. Either address will work. However, we are suggesting that you use the TRACS_Hotline@hud.gov making sure that there is an underscore between the words TRACS and Hotline. Please keep in mind that the TRACS maintenance staff is limited, but they will respond to your requests as quickly as possible. Again, Thank you for your patience and cooperation.   Posted July 2, 2002 TRACS Hotline Still Unavailable The TRACS Hotline is still unavailable for service. We are sorry for the inconvenience. If you have processing questions please email them via TRACSMail to TRACMHelp or via regular email to TRACSHot @hud.gov. We are working diligently to resume TRACS Hotline service. Thank you for your patience.   Posted June 24, 2002 Interruption in TRACS Hotline Service The TRACS Hotline is temporarily out of service. TRACS is working to resolve the problem as soon as possible. We hope to have the service operational within the next few days. We apologize for the inconvenience.   Posted June 20, 2002 MAT 15 PRODUCTION UPDATE As you have no doubt noticed, TRACS does not have the MAT15 process in production yet. The MAT15s submitted from June 3rd are warehoused. When we are comfortable with the performance of our MAT15 processing module, the MAT15s that have been submitted will be processed in the sequence they were received. Catching up will take several days. We recommend that you suspend sending MAT15s to TRACS until notified that production has resumed. Any MAT15s that are sent in will be warehoused and processed, but they will extend the catch-up period. TRACS Hotline Email Address Open for Business TRACS users having production processing questions, issues or problems may use the TRACS Hotline@hud.gov email address. As of June 19th, the TRACS Hotline will begin monitoring and responding to email messages addressed to this account.   Posted June 12, 2002 MAT70 Production Notice There have been many reports of MAT70s submitted to TRACS that seem to have disappeared without a trace. TRACS has identified a problem with the implementation of the MAT70 processing module that prevented it from processing all of the MAT70s in the TRACS input stream. This occurred anytime there were more that 1,000 MAT70s which is virtually every night. The MAT70 processing problem has been fixed. Any 201B MAT70 that was submitted to TRACS but received no acknowledgement by TRACSMail or does not show up in the Certification Query should be resubmitted to TRACS. We apologize for the inconvenience.   Posted June 6, 2002 TRACSMail Alert The scripts used by TRACSMail for data addressed to TRACMPROD will drop records that have the combination of a hyphen and an ""x"" (-x or x-) imbedded anywhere in the data. We are attempting to have the scripts modified, but as a general practice avoid the consecutive use of a hyphen and an ""x"" in any sequence. If you are not receiving acknowledgements or MAT confirmations for your submissions, please check your data for a ""-x"" or ""x-"" combination.   Posted 5/31/02 Revised MAT 15 PRODUCTION NOTICE RESUBMISSION REQUEST NOTE: Feedback from the Industry has pointed out the inconsistency between the language of the MAT User Guide and the instructions distributed yesterday (5/30/2002). TRACS will modify its code to be consistent with the MAT User's Guide. It will not be necessary to add the previous unit number to your MAT15s if the MAT15 is simply updating an existing record with the accessibility data. Since the TRACS database will be restored to its state before the April 18th production run, it will be necessary for you to resubmit the Release 201B MAT15 records submitted since April 18, 2002 to bring the database current. TRACS will begin processing the MAT15 records during the week of June 3, 2002. We apologize for the confusion and the inconvenience. TRACS   Posted 5/31/02 PRODUCTION NOTICE MAT15 ADDRESS RECORD RESUBMISSION REQUEST The abnormally high reject rate for 201B MAT15 records has been called to the attention of the TRACS Team. An investigation of the rejects indicates that approximately 75% of the MAT15 records that passed the MAT edits were rejected in the address processing. 10% of the rejects were due to an error in the TRACS logic that was rejecting MAT15s that had a SSN but no name and birth date (FA027). 88% of the rejects were due to the MAT15 matching an existing Unit in TRACS (FA035). These MAT15s were submitted as ADDs when they should have been submitted as UPDATEs. Because of the high reject level, TRACS is going to reset the Address database back to its state before the April 18, 2002 production cycle. Please resubmit the Release 201B MAT15 records that were submitted from April 18 through May 31, 2002. TRACS will restore the Address Database before the June 3, 2002 nightly TRACS production run. Please schedule your MAT15 resubmissions to start on June 3rd. The address query will reflect those addresses in the TRACS database prior to April 18 modified by the resubmissions beginning June 3rd. You may want to verify that your MAT15 submissions intended to update existing unit addresses are formatted properly for Release 201B to avoid the FA035 rejections. Release 201B determines if the MAT15 is an ADD or an UPDATE based upon the previous_unit_number. If the previous_unit_number is populated, the MAT15 is an UPDATE. A blank previous_unit_number identifies the MAT15 as an ADD. The FA035 error occurs when the MAT15 is submitted as an ADD, and the unit already exists. In these cases, the MAT15 should be resubmitted as an UPDATE.   Posted May 21, 2002 Receiving Others Error Messages In some cases, many of you may be receiving error messages that are apparently associated with properties other than your own. These messages are not based on your input data, but are a result of a TRACS ""scrub"" process. This temporary process that will occur once a month for the next few months, has an apparent ""bug"". The TRACS team realizes that this error has occurred and are working diligently to rectify the problem. Please ignore the messages!   Posted May 21, 2002 TRACS INDUSTRY MEETING JUNE 3 AND 4, 2002 Marriott Crystal City 1999 Jefferson Davis Highway Arlington, VA 22202 703-413-5500 AGENDA Monday, June 3, 2002 9:00 9:30 Welcome Multifamily Housing update TRACSMail Update TRACS Release 201B Update Break  10:30  10:45 10:45 REAC/TASS 12:00-1:15 1:15 Lunch  Special Claims  2:30  2:45 Break 2:45 Handbook Discussion  Tuesday, June 4, 2002 9:00 9:30 Day 1 Questions/Answers Overview of TRACS Edit Changes Break  10:30  10:45  10:45 Future Expectations Q&A 11:45 Wrap Up 12:00 Close   Posted May 21, 2002 REQUESTS FOR TRACSMAIL PASSWORD RESET Do not attempt to reset your password in Delegated Administrator. In the original instructions published for accessing TRACSMail you were advised that when you first access TRACSMail you should change you password in Delegated Administrator. However, after TRACSMail went into production we discovered that when users attempted to change their password in Delegated Administrator it resulted in them getting an error message whenever they would attempt to access TRACSMail with their new password or original password. Consequently the TRACS Hotline has been inundated with calls requesting password reset. For this reason we have been advising users to avoid using Delegated Administrator altogether. Contrary to instructions you may have been provided by your vendor, the password you were originally issued is not temporary and will work perfectly until you change it or request TRACS Hotline to change it.   Posted May 15, 2002 TRACS PRODUCTION UPDATE  MAT Messages for 5/14/2002 TRACS Production Cycle: The TRACS Tenant Batch process had to be restarted three times last night (5/14/2002). In each case, the MAT Tenant cycle was repeated. The transfer of MAT Messages to TRACSMail is an automatic process; consequently, messages from each rerun were sent out via TRACSMail. Please disregard the first two sets of MAT Tenant messages. The third set represents what was actually processed. 201B Maintenance Release: A maintenance release addressing several Voucher problems was implemented last night (5/14/2002). This release corrected logic that had been rejecting vouchers in error with CA Id messages and Special Claim Id messages. Vouchers rejected in error with messages related to CA Ids and Special Claim Ids should be resubmitted to TRACS as original vouchers. The handling of zero balance vouchers was modified to be consistent with the 201A handling of zero balance vouchers. Missing Tenant Messages: TRACS discovered that the tenant messages generated by TRACS were not being transferred to TRACSMail. The HUD data center has recovered and transmitted the tenant messages going back at least to May 1, 2002. Unresolved Issues: The recovery of the Unit Address Table is progressing and the MAT15s submitted under 201B are being processed in the sequence submitted. As of today, the table is current through May 3rd. The Voucher Query is displaying as the Total Voucher a CA submits the voucher, the Total Amount Approved If the amount approved by the CA differs from what displaying the amount sent to LOCCS. A correction queue. Amount the OA Total Voucher Amount. When by the CA should be displayed in this column. the OA requested, the voucher query is not to the Voucher Query is in our maintenance  A Special Claim submitted for zero dollars together with a Miscellaneous Accounting transaction can cause anomalies that TRACS is currently researching. Until the edits are revised, please do not submit zero balance special claims to TRACS.   Posted May 14, 2002 DRAFT 4350.3 REVISION POSTED ON THE WEB The Office of Housing Assistance and Grant Administration posted the draft revision to Handbook 4350.3, Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Programs on the web at: http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/hsgmulti.cfm When the page comes up, you have two options to pull up the draft document: First, you may go to the right hand side of this page, look for What's New? and click on the title. Second, you may click on Program Information on the left hand side, scroll down the list of information until you get to Occupancy Handbook  draft copy of HUD Handbook 4350.3 NEW and click on it.   Posted May 14, 2002 Return Tenant Message Problem It was recently brought to the TRACS attention that TRACS Tenant processing messages since approximately May 1 have not been returned to our TRACS users. TRACS has investigated the problem and found that the back-end process for sending messages to users failed because of the extremely large volume of tenant messages generated. This back-end process for sending messages has been fixed and as of today, May 13, 2002, the backlog of Tenant processing messages occurring since May 1 will be returned to our user.   Posted May 7, 2002 201B Special Claim Specification Change ""Traditional"" CAs: As announced at the last Industry Meeting, CA_Ids will not be used in TRACS MAT transactions for ""traditional"" CAs until further notice. The CA Id will not be used in the VCHHR or TENHR, and not as the first five positions of the Claim Id in the Special Claim Record, MAT30, Section 5. The 201A rules should continue to be followed with the Claim Id: The first four characters will be ""1299"" followed by an audit number assigned by the CA. The Claim Id should be in the leftmost positions of the 14-character Claim Id field. PB CAs: The PB CAs will be expected to submit their CA Id in the TRACS MAT VCHHR and TENHR records. They will not need to submit their CA Id as the first five positions of the Special Claim Claim Id. They can continue to follow the 201A rules and submit a Claim Id of ""1299"" followed by a five-character audit number assigned by the PB CA. The nine-character Claim Id is to be entered in the leftmost positions of the Claim Id field. Alternatively, they may use their five-character CA_Id followed by a nine-character audit number, as described in the Industry Specification. Owners and Management Agents: The Special Claim Intranet application that was to be used with 201B special Claims has been overtaken by events with the repeated delays in Release 201B implementation. The Special Claim Intranet application has been withdrawn to be replaced with an Internet/Intranet Special Claim process scheduled for August 2002 release. Field offices will continue to return to the owners and management agents the nine-character Special Claim Ids as in the past. The first four characters of these Claim Ids are the field office area and office code, and the last five characters are the audit number. The nine-character Claim Id is to be entered in the leftmost positions of the Claim Id field.   Posted May 7, 2002 TRACS Industry Group Meeting Performance Based Contract Administration Focus Group June 3-5, 2002 Marriott Crystal City Hotel Arlington, VA The following quarterly meetings will be held the week of June 3 and are as follows:   TRACS Industry Group Meeting, June 3-4 Performance Based Contract Administration Focus Group Meeting, June 5  Both of these meetings will be held at the Marriott Crystal City Hotel in Arlington, Virginia.

The queries include Move-in/Move-out; Multiple Occupancy, Project Evaluation and Verification. The REMS release has been delayed until May 17, 2002. This means these queries will be unavailable until May 20, 2002. We are sorry for the delay.   Posted April 29, 2002 Unit Address Notice The TRACS Unit Address table became corrupted during the April 18, 2002 processing cycle. The cause has been isolated and recovery is under way. The TRACS Unit Address table has been restored as of the end of the April 17, 2002 processing cycle. MAT15s from April 18, 23, and 25 will be reprocessed by TRACS to bring the Unit Address table current. It is possible that a MAT15 rejected in one run may have been resubmitted in another. If what appears to be duplicate transactions are encountered in the recovery process, the duplicate will be rejected. MAT15s do not have to be resubmitted to TRACS for this recovery.   Posted April 26, 2002  TRACS PRODUCTION NOTICE April 30, 2002 is the cutoff for Release 201A processing by TRACS. There will be a clean-up Release 201A production run on Wednesday, May 1. After May 1, there will be three, Voucher Only, 201A production runs: May 10, May 24 and June 7. The TRACS Production Schedule for the week of April 29, 2002 will have two Release 201A cycles: Mon. 4/29/2002 Tue. 4/30/2002 Wed. 5/01/2002 Thu. Fri. 5/02/2002 5/03/2002 Release Release Release submit Release Release 201B 201A (Tenant and Voucher) 201A (Voucher and Tenant rollover from Tuesday. Note: The last data to Tenant data using 201A is Tuesday, April 30, 2002. 201B 201B  Starting May 2, 2002, all TRACS production will be Release 201B, with the exception of the Voucher Only 201A runs scheduled for May 10, May 24 and June 7.   Posted April 26, 2002  TRACS 201B Schedule Implementation While many software vendors have completed their software enhancements to comply with TRACS Mail and 201B requirements, the Department is aware that several software vendors with large user groups have either not shipped their 201B compliant software to clients or the software that has been shipped is error-ridden. Consequently, some properties/sites will not be able to submit tenant and voucher data on the new 201B format effective May 1, 2002, because of late vendor shipment their 201B software will not be installed/deployed. The Department has determined that over the next 6 weeks three more TRACS production cycles will be scheduled on Friday's to accommodate clients that have not deployed/installed 201B compliant software. TRACS can open the volume limits to the 300,000 maximum records on Friday nights. There is a maximum limit of 150,000 records during week day processing cycles; thus, reserving Friday nights for processing 201A transactions is the most effective and efficient use of TRACS mainframe processing time. I recommend that the Industry submit VOUCHER DATA ONLY in the 201A format. I make the recommendation to submit only voucher requests for payment under 201A because TRACS users will be submitting revised baseline for tenant data in 201B FORMAT (201B to provides the accessibility data) in the future; thus, eliminating this duplication will free up more TRACS mainframe processing time for payment of vouchers under the 201A format. Bottom line, the submission of voucher data under 201A format will assure that all voucher data will be processed within TRACS cycle processing limits. The three runs will be on Friday nights as follows: May 1, 2002: If Needed Based Upon Processing Volume Clean-up of Unprocessed 201A Transactions from April 30, 2002 201A Processing of Voucher Data (ONLY VOUCHER DATA) 201A Processing of Voucher Data (ONLY VOUCHER DATA) 201A Processing of Voucher Data (ONLY VOUCHER DATA)  May 10, 2002: May 24, 2002: June 7, 2002:   Posted April 25, 2002 NEXT TRACS/PBCA FOCUS MEETING DATES  June 2002 We are in final hotel negotiations for the next meetings. The hotel will be in close proximity to the last hotel. Dates are Monday and Tuesday, June 3 and 4, for the TRACS/Industry meeting, and Wednesday, June 5, for the PBCA Focus meeting. When hotel negotiations are complete, we will post the location, number and room costs as well as registration requirements.   Posted April 23, 2002 * * * ATTENTION * * * Please note that a problem was discovered with a portion of the TRACS code that processes vouchers. As it stands now, all Section 8 contracts are being treated as though they were submitted by a Contract Administrator. Subsequently, the VF063 and VF058 fatal error messages are being erroneously generated for those not submitting through a CA. A fix for the VF063 and VF058 Fatal messages will be moved to production on April 26th. Once the code is in production, you will need to resubmit your voucher data again. A follow -up message will be posted to the TRACS Discussion Forum and the TRACS Announcement Forum when the fix is implemented. We are sorry for the inconvenience.   Posted April 11, 2002  Release 201B Production Update Next week, Release 201B data will be processed two nights: Tuesday, April 16 and Thursday, April 18.  ***** Reminder ***** TRACS is accepting ONLY 201B data for processing in the vendor region. 201A Vendor test data will not be processed.  *** ATTENTION *** Vendor 201B Testing In order to facilitate vendor testing of 201B software, affective immediately, TRACS will process 3 Vendor cycles each day. The Vendor processing cycles will occur at 7:00 AM, 12 Noon and 3:00 PM.   Posted April 8, 2002 201B Testing and CA ID's If a ""CA ID"" required message is returned with a test of the 201B MAT, it is an indication that the contract number being used has received production transmissions from a PB CA. The test data should be resubmitted with the CA ID field populated with the id of the CA to which the contract is assigned. The table used to edit the contract numbers is a copy of the a production table. A flag is set in this table whenever a transmission is received for the contract from a PB CA. When this table is loaded into the vendor region to facilitate testing, it carries with it the flags and coding reflecting the contract status in the production system. This can create unexpected results for testers.   Posted March 28, 2002  Have you been transmitting through TRACSMail but have not received any responses? Then perhaps your messages have been going to the TRACSMail Dead letter File. These are messages sent through TRACSMail where users have not correctly defined their TRACSMail email address in their email client profile. The instructions for defining your profile set up are provided in the TRACSMail User Manual. The instructions for Netscape are on page 24 and on page 30 for Outlook. If you are using vendor software then your vendor can provide instructions specific to their software. TRACSMail is not able to send responses to these addresses. In most cases the TRACSMail address is misspelled or transposed, or an Internet email address was entered instead of your TRACSMail address. The format for a valid TRACSMail address is TRACMXXXXX@TRACSMAIL.HUD.GOV (XXXXX = your assigned TRACSMail ID). No one should use TRACMTEST@TRACSMAIL.HUD.GOV in his or her email profile setup. TRACMTEST is already assigned as the address for sending test files to TRACS. If you recognize any of the addresses listed in the Dead letter List below as one that you have used, please make the necessary correction before submitting any further activity through TRACSMail. Dead letter Listing as of 3/13/02 Goodman   (need to change to tracmxxxxx@tracsmail.hud.gov) jhughes@cl.carbondale.il.us vsa@ddha.org acha@nts-online.net yadanchen@msn.com   Posted March 22, 2002 Urgent! 201B MAT 70 Change New Unit Number  The 201B MAT70, field 11, ""New Unit Number"" has been changed. The MAT Guide has not yet been updated to reflect the change but will be soon. We apologize for this oversight. In the meantime, here is the explanation of the change: Before 201B, this field has been used to identify the new unit number that the household will be occupying as a result of a unit transfer. Or, if the MAT70 was a gross rent change only, the field would be filled with all 9s to signify that it is a gross rent change with no change to the unit number. As for 201B, however, this field will now be used to identify the unit being affected for both a unit transfer and a gross rent change. This will ensure that the new gross rent is being applied to the correct unit that the tenant was occupying at the time of the gross rent change. This means that the 201B MAT 70 user is required to submit a unit number in this field. Entering all 9s into the field will not be permitted with 201B. If you do, the fatal error F0192 will be generated: ""MAT70 not processed. Unit Number may not be all 9s"". To distinguish between a gross rent change and a unit transfer, enter ""GR"" or ""UT"" into the Transaction Type, field 4 of the MAT70. If this field is populated with any other letters or digits, the fatal error F0196 will be generated: ""MAT70 not processed. Transaction Type must be UT or GR"".   Posted March 15, 2002 ASPEN SYSTEMS TELEPHONES AGAIN AVAILABLE  As of yesterday, March 14, 2002, the Aspen Systems Hotline at 1-800-685-8470 and email at mfhc@aspensys.com are again available to assist you in obtaining a TRACSMail ID and password. You will still need to complete a TRACSMail ID Request and Registration form. That form will then be faxed to Aspen at 301-519-6655. Sorry for any inconvenience.   Posted March 7, 2002 TRACS Production Notice March 6th was the first scheduled production run of TRACS Release 201B. A miscommunication with TRACS Production Control resulted in an attempt to re-execute the March 5th production cycle using the same 201A data and programs. The error was caught, but not before the MAT cycle was (re) run. Consequently, 201A MAT messages were sent out last night from this attempted rerun. Please disregard the Release 201A MAT messages produced the evening of March 6th. The miscommunication was corrected and the 201B Tenant production cycle completed normally. The 201B Voucher production cycle will be executed during the day today, March 7th. The March 7, 201A production will be executed tonight as scheduled. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.   Posted March 7, 2002 As of Monday, March 4th, 2002, the TRACS Hotline will no longer be responsible for issuing new TRACSMail ID's and passwords or distributing TRACSMail ID's and passwords from the converted Sprint Mailbox ID's. This function has been tasked to Aspen Systems. If you have questions regarding TRACSMail ID's or if you are requesting new TRACMail ID's and passwords or if you have not received your converted from Sprintmail ID and password, please contact Aspen Systems Hotline at 1800-685-8470 or email Aspen at mfhc@aspensys.com. You will be required to complete a TRACSMail ID Request and Registration form. Please fax the completed form to Aspen at (301) 519-6655. They will issue to you a TRACSMail ID and password. The TRACS Hotline will still be responsible for resetting TRACSMail ID passwords. The TRACS Hotline phone number is 1-800-767-7588.   Posted March 5, 2002  TRACS Industry Meeting March 11 & 12, 2002 Hyatt Regency Crystal City 2799 Jefferson Davis Highway Arlington, VA 22202 703-418-1234  Agenda Monday, March 11, 2002 9:00 Welcome Multifamily Housing update TRACSMail Status Break  9:45  10:30  10:45 10:45 11:30  TRACS Release 201B Status Unit & SSN QA Reports Lunch  12:00  1:00 1:00 2:00  Tenant Reports Supplemental Payments Break  2:30  2:45 2:45 3:30 4:30  The Funding Process Q&A Conclude Day 1  Tuesday, March 12, 2002 9:00 9:30 Welcome Benefit History Report Enhancements Break  10:30  10:45 10:45 11:45 12:00 Q&A  Wrap up Close   Posted Feb 28, 2002 HOTEL REGISTRATION DEADLINE  For those attending the TRACS and /or HUD FOCUS Group meetings March 11 and 12, or March 13 and 14, we have been reminded the hotel deadline is tomorrow, March 1st. After that date the hotel will be unable to honor the government rate for later room reservations. The lowest available rate (outside of our rate) today at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City is $189 plus tax. See you in a couple of weeks.   Posted Feb. 27, 2002  Release 201B Production Scheduled Effective Wednesday, March 6, 2002, TRACS Wednesday night production will be dedicated to Release 201B production. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday night TRACS production will continue to be for Release 201A data until further notice. We do encourage everyone to run at least one test of their 201B software and data through the TRACS test facility by addressing their submission to TRACMTEST@tracsmail.hud.gov. Release 201B data submitted to TRACMPROD prior to March 1, 2002 will be treated by TRACS as test data and run through the test facility. Any Release 201B data submitted to TRACS prior to March 1, 2002 will not be submitted to TRACS production, and it will not update the TRACS production database. NOTE: Do not submit the same data to TRACMPROD in both 201A and 201B formats. The same TRACS database is updated by both TRACS Release 201A and Release 201B production runs, and the double submission will result in duplicate conditions. Release 201B data submitted to TRACMPROD@tracsmail.hud.gov on or after March 1, 2002 will be submitted to the next scheduled Release 201B production run. Release 201A data submitted to TRACMPROD@tracsmail.hud.gov will be submitted to the next scheduled Release 201A production run. Release 201A and Release 201B data can be submitted to TRACS at any time. Data submitted to TRACMTEST will be submitted to the TRACS test facility the following day and the messages returned. Data submitted to TRACMPROD will be warehoused until the next scheduled 201A or 201B production run. TRACS has a limited window of time each night, except Friday, to complete its batch processing. Consequently, a record limit is imposed on the nightly volume. The limit is currently 180,000 records, rounded up to include complete transmissions. When this limit is exceeded, TRACS selects the records selected based upon a priority. Voucher records are selected first. Any Tenant records that have been warehoused are selected on a first-in-first-out basis. The limit is lifted on Friday nights so that any backlog will be processed on Friday nights. The 180,000 limit is exceeded only during the peak submission periods, usually the first and last weeks of the month. When Release 201B is added to the production schedule on March 6, 2002, there will be no limit initially imposed. As the 180,000 record threshold is approached, TRACS will schedule a second night of 201B production. Please check the Announcements Page at least weekly to get the latest Release 201A and 201B production schedules   Posted Feb 26, 2002 TRACS INDUSTRY MEETING The next TRACS Industry Group Meeting will be held Monday, March 11 and Tuesday, March12 at: Hyatt Regency Crystal City 2799 Jefferson Davis Highway Arlington, VA 22202 703-418-1234 The PBCA Focus Group Meeting is Wednesday, March 13 through Thursday, March 14 at the same hotel.

HOW TO SET THE CORRECT CACHE OPTION IN PREFERENCES For the Netscape profile you have established you need to set its ""Document in Cache is compared to document on the network"" option to ""every time"". This only needs to be done once. To accomplish this execute the following steps: In NETSCAPE click on Edit. Click on Preferences and the Preference window will appear. Click on Advanced Click on Cache and the Cache window will appear. On the lower half of the window is the sentence ""Document in Cache is   compared to document on the network"" and under this statement are following three options: 1. Once per session 2. Every time 3. Never Select Every Time and Click on OK.   Posted by TRACS on February 04, 2002 at 12:47:45:  TRACS Release 201B Implementation TRACS Release 201B has been available for production since December 1, 2001; however, the emphasis on conversion to TRACSMail has been the priority effort. As previously stated, TRACS will publish in advance which nights Release 201B will run and which nights 201A will run. There has been no published schedule because we know of no one who is ready to go into production with 201B. Our plan is to wait to schedule 201B production until we know of enough 201B ready sites to make reserving a production cycle for 201B data worthwhile. We would like to have at least the equivalent of 200 contracts. This could be a mix of service bureaus, owner agents, CAs etc. As you are ready to go into production with Release 201B, please send a message to TRACS@hud.gov letting us know that you are ready for 201B, and include a contact name and phone number. NOTE: Release 201B submissions to either TRACMTEST (for testing) or TRACMPROD (for production) must be submitted using TRACSMail.   Posted by TRACS on January 22, 2002 at 14:42:17: The Tenant Assessment Subsystem (TASS), the REAC group that produces the Benefit History Reports, has previously announced that they will not make Benefit History Reports available on TRACSMail. The Benefit History Reports will be available exclusively over the Internet. The significance for TRACSMail users is that they will no longer receive Benefit History Reports via SprintMail. Monthly Benefit History Reports are available on the Internet for viewing, printing and downloading at http://www.hud.gov/reac. Click on the ""online systems"" link on left side of this page and then click on the ""log in"" button. The reports are available under Tenant Assessment Subsystem.

These dates were changed to February 20-21. We have been unable to complete contract negotiations with a hotel in a timely manner to keep the dates and help you with cost savings for your travel expenses. We are canceling the February meeting and looking to work with our counterparts to have a joint PBCA Focus Group/TRACS Industry meeting in March. If any of you are aware of other industry meetings here in Washington during March, please respond quickly. Our first preference for scheduling is the week of March 18th. Should that week prove unacceptable, we will quickly back upwards in the month as the last week in March includes Palm Sunday, Passover and Good Friday. Sorry for any inconvenience.   Posted by TRACS on January 15, 2002 at 15:46:05: !!! TRACSMAIL ALERT !!! Have you been submitting your MAT files to TRACSMail but never received your responding messages and/or reports? Normally, you can expect a response within 24 - 48 hours. However, one reason some of you have never received any messages back is because you have not correctly defined your email address in your email client profile. You must use only your TRACSMail email address when setting up your email client profile. This is illustrated in the TRACSMail User Manual on page 24 for Netscape Profile and page 30 for Outlook Profile. Do not enter your Internet email address or anything other than your assigned TRACSMail address (tracmxxxxx@tracsmail.hud.gov where tracmxxxxx = your assigned ID). TRACSMail is on a closed network and will only recognize email messages from/to other valid TRACSMail addresses. We have seen several messages come through with the address of inbox@tracsmail.hud.gov and because ""inbox"" is not a valid TRACSMail address we do not have a clue as to who this sender is and we cannot even send a message to the user to advise them of their error. If your email software has been provided by your TRACS software vendor, check your documentation or contact your vendor to be sure that your software settings are correct.   Posted by TRACS on January 09, 2002 at 13:01:22: IMPORTANT TIPS FOR TRACSMAIL USERS TRACSMail has been available learned many valuable lessons testing efforts of various users. errors and tips on how to avoid to the industry since 11/13/01 and we have from monitoring the What follows is a list of the most common user or resolve them.  1. Do not send messages to TRACMTEST or TRACMPROD that do not have valid MAT files attached. These two TRACSMAIL addresses are reserved exclusively for transmitting MAT files to TRACS. If you should send any messages without a MAT file attachment to either of these addresses you will not receive a response. If you should have any questions concerning TRACSMAIL you may send them to TRACMHELP@TRACSMAIL.HUD.GOV. 2. Some users are attaching non-MAT files as test data to TRACMTEST. Since the TRACS system will only process MAT data, data in any other format will be discarded by TRACS. Please only submit MAT records when testing TRACSMAIL. 3. Do not include a TO/FROM header in your MAT files as is done by some software that creates MAT files for SprintMail. TRACSMail will insert the TO/FROM headers in all text files attached to messages sent through TRACSMail. This means that Service Bureaus and CAs must remove the TO/FROM headers from any MAT files they receive through TRACSMail from their owner/agents before sending their data to TRACMPROD/TRACMTEST. 4. Many users have submitted MAT files but have not received their responding messages. In many cases this is because the email address they set up in their email client profile is incorrect. You must use only your TRACSMail email address when setting up your email client profile. This is illustrated in the TRACSMail User Manual on page 24 for Netscape Profile and page 30 for Outlook Profile. If you enter anything other than your assigned TRACSMail address (tracmxxxxx@tracsmail.hud.gov where tracmxxxxx = your assigned ID) TRACSMail will not have a valid TRACSMail address to format your TO/FROM header or to send your messages to. If your email software has been provided by your TRACS software vendor, check your documentation or contact your vendor to be sure that your software settings are correct.   5. It is extremely important that all users update their personal account information in Delegated Administrator which is covered in chapter 7 of the TRACSMail User Manual. The correct URL for the Delegated Administrator web site is http://tracsmail.hud.gov. The information you provide here helps us to accurately identify the owner of every TRACSMail account. At the very minimum you need to enter your telephone number, organization name, manager name, mailing address, contact email address, and select what type of organization you are. 6. Some users are submitting production MAT 201A data to TRACMPROD without first testing the submission of MAT files to TRACMTEST. We highly recommend that you first test submitting files to TRACMTEST and verifying that the expected responses are received in your TRACSMail account in-box. After you have successfully tested and confirmed TRACSMail is operating smoothly for you then you can begin submitting your 201A files to TRACMPROD. It can take 24 to 48 hours to receive a response from TRACMTEST, so please be patient. 7. Some users experience a successful dial-in, however, the error message that the server is down or unavailable is received. Since dial-in to the server was successful, the server is available. Therefore, verify that the server name you specified is spelled correctly. For example, you will always receive the above error when trying to contact http://tracmmail.hud.gov/ rather than http://tracsmail.hud.gov/ because tracmmail.hud.gov does not exist. 8. E-mail can successfully be sent, however, the error message, ""the user does not exist"" occurs when attempting to retrieve mail. This problem primarily occurs due to a typographical error or a misconfiguration of the client profile. Since the user is able to successfully dial into the server and this is a one-account single sign-on system, the account exists. Verify that the profile has correct account names in both the Incoming and Outgoing mail server fields (see page 25 of Creating a Netscape Profile section in the TRACSMail User Manual or check your software documentation if your email software has been provided by your TRACS software vendor). Another reason that this might occur is because the email services were not added to the account. If the profile is correct then call the TRACS Help Desk as ask them to verify that the account in question does have mail services enabled.   Posted by TRACS on December 21, 2001 at 08:51:11: TRACS will be down on December 24th and December 25th for the Holiday. Processing will resume on December 26th.   Posted by TRACS on November 27, 2001 at 12:16:14: ATTENTION TRACSMAIL USERS Do not address messages to TRACMTEST or TRACMPROD that do not have valid MAT files attached. These two TRACSMAIL addresses are reserved exclusively for transmitting MAT files to TRACS. If you should send any messages without a MAT file attachment to either of these addresses you will not receive a response. If you should have any questions concerning TRACSMAIL you may send them to TRACMHELP@TRACSMAIL.HUD.GOV.   Posted by TRACS on November 27, 2001 at 10:56:04: The TRACS servers will be down today from 4:00 PM until 6:00 PM for maintenance.

The new mechanism is a Virtual Private Network (VPN), serviced by Sprint, and is being called TRACSMail. TRACSMail has been designed to ease our transition to a full-blown Internet solution that we hope to implement by the end of FY 2002, and will be a vast improvement over SprintMail. However, in order to give our industry partners time to adapt their software to the TRACSMail replacement, we have revised our schedule to support both SprintMail and TRACSMail for TRACS Release 201A through January 2002. After that date, all TRACS data must be submitted via TRACSMail, and, as explained more fully below, all data submitted under the new TRACS Release 201B must be submitted via TRACSMail only, and the implementation schedule for 201B has been revised accordingly. TRACS Release 201B was developed to operate with TRACSMail as the communications vehicle. Originally, the announced intent was to support TRACS Release 201A on SprintMail during the transition to Release 201B on TRACSMail. In order to minimize the number of conversions that the user base is going through at one time, TRACS has made the decision to support Release 201A under both SprintMail and TRACSMail until SprintMail is discontinued, now rescheduled for February 1, 2002, but support Release 201B only under TRACSMail. TRACS is encouraging the Industry to expedite their conversion to TRACSMail. By converting the existing 201A business applications to communicate using TRACSMail, your payments after January 1, 2002 will not depend upon the continuance of SprintMail. For TRACS and Industry data processors serving multiple sites, supporting two types of communications software does ratchet up the operational complexity. During the transition to TRACSMail, TRACS, CAs, service bureaus, and central sites will inevitably receive 201A data via SprintMail and via TRACSMail. The sites submitting to TRACS, CAs, service bureaus and central sites are likely to have different software developers deploying their software at different times. They will need to send messages in reply using the communications vehicle by which the data was received. Data processors will be able to communicate exclusively with TRACS using TRACSMail while their client base may still be a mix of SprintMail and TRACSMail users. The sooner all users convert to TRACSMail, the better for all parties involved. The conversion to TRACSMail may be traumatic for those sites without particularly computer literate management. If they are currently using DOS systems, TRACSMail is likely to call for a hardware upgrade as well as a new operating system and the addition of a browser. The successfulconversion to TRACSMail could be facilitated if that conversion is done before converting to Release 201B. It will reduce the number of new procedures introduced at one time. It will also reduce the operational complexity for CAs and data processors   serving multiple sites if the conversion to TRACSMail is disconnected from the conversion to 201B. If the conversion to Release 201B under TRACSMail is attempted at the same time that Release 201A is being handled from both SprintMail and TRACSMail, data processing operations will have to cope with 201A SprintMail, 201A TRACSMail and 201B TRACSMail all at the same time during the transition. We encourage users to get the TRACSMail conversion behind them before moving to the 201B application software. TRACS is recommending that the conversion to Release 201B be deferred until SprintMail is discontinued. This will mean that data processors serving multiple sites will still have to handle Release 201A TRACSMail and 201B TRACSMail during the application software transition, but that will be simplified somewhat by TRACS processing 210A or 201B data based on a pre-published operations schedule. TRACS has already converted its database to accommodate the new 201B data elements. When 201B goes into production it will be an application software implementation only for TRACS - not an application software implementation and a database conversion. The revised implementation schedule has the following key milestones: 9/24/01 TRACSMail testing by TRACS staff 10/08 - 10/19/01 TRACSMail - 201A user acceptance testing (Industry) 10/22/01 Release 201B Industry testing switched to TRACSMail 10/22 - 10/31/02 TRACSMail - 201A pilot operation 11/01/01 TRACSMail - 201A available for production 12/01/01 Initiate TRACSMail - 201B pilot (Note: Early conversion to 201B will be available to those participating in the 201B pilot.) 02/01/02 Discontinue SprintMail TRACSMail - 201B available for production TRACSMail - 201A support continues 4/01/02 Discontinue 201A   Posted by TRACS on October 03, 2001 at 11:30:48: The Voucher processing cycle was suspended on October 2 as well as October 1. The voucher problem has been researched and a fix will be in place by COB today, October 3rd. All voucher input files from September 28, October 1 and October 2 have been recovered and will be processed starting with the September 28 input files first. It is anticipated that TRACS will be current no later than October 4.   Posted by TRACS on October 02, 2001 at 15:07:34: The October 1, 2001 Voucher processing cycle was suspended due to an apparent configuration management problem at the data center. All vouchers were processed through the MAT edits, but processing was suspended before the business edits. We anticipate that the problem will be resolvedtoday. No action is required on the part of the Industry. We expect to be current with voucher processing by morning.   Posted by TRACS on October 01, 2001 at 15:12:34: Dear SprintMail User; The TRACSMail User Manual has been received from the vendor. It is being edited now and will be available next week (week ending 10/05/01). The manual contains important information on the recommended hardware and software standards for TRACSMail, step-by-step instructions for Dial-up Networking setup, Netscape Communicator/Messenger Installation, Profile setup, and how to connect to TRACSMail. There are two methods by which you may obtain a copy of the User Manual: 1. Before October 5, 2001 you will be able to download the manual from the TRACS Document page on the web http://www.hud.gov/fha/mfh/trx/html/trxdocs.html. The day the manual is available a notice will be posted on the TRACS Announcement page. 2. Beginning October 5, 2001 you may call HUD Document Distribution Center at 1-800-767-7468 and ask that a paper copy of the TRACSMail User Manual be mailed to your organization.   Posted by TRACS on September 24, 2001 at 08:55:03: **** Attention all TRACS SprintMail Users ***** This is an update to a message originally posted 8/24/01 in which you were notified that SprintMail is being discontinued by Sprint effective 1/01/2002. Originally you were told that if you do not receive both of the messages, referenced below, by September 14, 2001 you should contact TRACS. However, this update message is to inform you that there has been a delay to the dates these messages will be sent out. The first of the messages will not be available until September 28, 2001 and the second message will not be sent until October 17, 2001. The interim replacement for SprintMail is a custom email system provided by Sprint specifically for HUD that is being called TRACSMail. TRACSMail has been designed to be nearly transparent to the SprintMail user, but your current SprintMail interface must be changed before you can use TRACSMail. TRACS and Sprint are currently testing TRACSMail. TRACSMail will be available to all TRACS users for TRACS Release 201A production and 201B testing by November 1, 2001. Software vendors have been working with us in this endeavor, and they will be providing their clients with either instructions to follow in this transition and/or new software with instructions. Several industry vendors, CAs and owner/agents will be participating in a pilot operation under TRACSMail during October. You can expect to receive two very important messages in your SprintMail mailbox over the next few weeks. The first message will provide critical information about the hardware and software requirements for interfacing with TRACSMail. The ""TRACSMail Interim Industry Specification"" document is currently available from the TRACS Documents Page at http://www.hud.gov/fha/mfh/trx/html/trxdocs.html. Make certain that whoever maintains your computer software has a copy of this message. The second message will contain your new TRACSMail Address and password. You will not be able to login to TRACSMail without this information. If you do not receive both of the messages, referenced above, by October 22, 2001 please contact TRACS either by email at TRACS@hud.gov or call the TRACS Hotline at 800-767-7588. Be sure to indicate ""TRACSMail"" as the subject. Your message should include your SprintMail mailbox ID, your name and telephone number, and your organization's name, mailing address, and type of organization (service bureau, contract administrator, owner/agent).   Posted by TRACS on September 19, 2001 at 13:45:05: Due to the tragedy in New York, the New York HUD office has been closed. Until the office is reopened, owners and agents who have questions regarding TRACS that cannot be answered by the TRACS help desk should contact the Newark, New Jersey office at (973) 622-7900 extension 3410 or the Buffalo, New York office at (716) 551-5755 extension 5598 or 5599.   Posted by TRACS on September 19, 2001 at 12:14:54: Attention all TRACS SprintMail Users UPDATED MESSAGE - 09/19/01 This is an update to a message originally posted 8/24/01 in which you were notified that SprintMail is being discontinued by Sprint effective 1/01/2002.

We asked our contact at Lockheed-Martin, who interfaces with Sprint, to find out if there were any anomalies anywhere in the communications chain that could have affected TRACS users. He learned that Sprint was apparently under a Spam attack last week. As a defensive measure Sprint put a filter into the network causing messages of over a 1-meg to be hung up until they could be checked out. This had the effect of clogging up the network. This happened three times last week. The first time was the evening of August 29 creating a backlog within Sprint that rippled through the rest of the week. It happened again the morning of August 30 and again in the evening compounding the backlog of messages in Sprint. Sprint has removed the filters, and your transmissions should go through as you intended. There is no guarantee that Sprint will not find it necessary to replace the filter when circumstances make it necessary to preserve network operations. TRACS submissions made the last week of the month may be particularly vulnerable to this type of delay because there may not be enough time to handle the contingencies and still get the payments out on time. As a Virtual Private Network, TRACSMail should be less vulnerable to this kind of an attack, but transmissions made the last day of the month will continue to be too late to recover from any contingencies that might occur anywhere in the communications network.   Posted by TRACS on August 30, 2001 at 13:24:58: TRACS 201B Testing Tips TRACV Ids: 201B Testing is available using SprintMail as the communications vehicle. Since SprintMail is being used, test must be submitted using a TRACVnnnnn mailbox id. If testers do not have a TRACV Id, please call the Hotline to get a TRACV Id assigned. Project and Contract Numbers: In 201B, the project and contract numbers are validated in the MAT edit. If testers are submitting bogus project and contract numbers in their test data, the test data will be rejected by the MAT. This is the primary reason for test failures. The test and production data are run on identical, but totally separate platforms. The test machine is actually the configuration used as a disaster/recovery backup in a different data center in a different state from the production platform. 201B TRACSMail Testing: The TRACSMail Testing, with 201A data, has been deferred due to delays in getting the T- 1 lines installed. After TRACSMail has successfully passed the TRACS and the TRACS User acceptance tests, 201B testing will be switched to TRACSMail. When this switch occurs, testers will need a TRACSMnnnnn address. TRACV Ids will not be accepted over TRACSMail. Tests using TRACSMail will be addressed to a separate mailbox. Production data will be addressed to TRACSPROD and test data will be addressed to TRACSTEST. When data are returned to the sender by TRACS, the FROM: address will be TRACSPROD for production data and TRACSTEST for tests. Testers requiring a TRACM address should contact the TRACSMail coordinator, Carolyn_X._Byars@hud.gov. Anomalies: Please report any anomalies discovered in your 201B testing to TRACS@hud.gov Subject = Vendor Tests. Although we have been rigorously testing the 201B code, your testing could find anomalies in the TRACS code that our tests have missed. Focus on TRACSMail with 201A: Implementation schedules are being reviewed due to the delay in the TRACSMail installation. The deadline that raises the most concern is 1/01/02. We encourage users to switch to TRACSMail at the earliest possible time using 201A. 201A support, using TRACSMail will continue int 2002. By switching 201A from SprintMail to TRACSMail, the 201B software can be deployed and the conversion conducted without the added anxiety of the SprintMail 1/01/02 drop dead date. Any schedule revisions will be published as soon as they become available.   Posted by TRACS on August 22, 2001 at 08:23:45: Attention all TRACS SprintMail Users SprintMail is being discontinued by Sprint effective 1/01/2002.

Since TRACS is not requiring the voucher detail MAT formats, CAs cannot require them.   Posted by TRACS on July 13, 2001 at 15:29:33: ANNOUNCEMENT UPDATE The TRACSMail Interim Industry Specification Document is now available on the TRACS Home Page under TRACS Documents.   Posted by TRACS on July 13, 2001 at 12:37:03: On Monday July 9, 2001 a new voucher message was added to the TRACS processing. The message and status is VSP10/P10: Voucher has been conditionally accepted by LOCCS for payment. Previously, LOCCS did not acknowledge a current voucher that they had conditionally accepted for a first of the month payment. TRACS would return the message stating that the voucher had been sent to LOCCS, and the next message would be at the end of the month when the voucher was staged for payment. This change adds a positive acknowledgement that LOCCS has accepted the voucher for payment. TRACS realized that the P10 status was implemented before the Industry had been advised of the change, so the change was backed out temporarily so that the Industry could be advised of the change. It will be reinstalled on Monday, July 23, 2001. The P10 status and the associated message will be returned for current Section 8, 202/162 PAC, 202 PRAC or 811 PRAC vouchers that been accepted by LOCCS for payment during their end of month payment cycle. LOCCS will continue to issue the P00 status when payment for the voucher is sent to Treasury. TRACS generates theVSP00 message when LOCCS returns the P00 status.   Posted by TRACS on July 12, 2001 at 12:35:40: A TRACSMail Interim Industry Specification Document (IISD) is being prepared for the Industry to use in their software development for communications via TRACSMail. TRACSMail will be available in production starting October 1, 2001. TRACSMail will support TRACS 201A and 201B. SprintMail will continue to support TRACS 201A until December 31, 2001. The transition from SprintMail to TRACSMail must be accomplished before December 31, 2001. SprintMail will be discontinued starting January 1, 2002. Questions or comments concerning the IISD should be communicated to TRACS at TRACS@HUD.gov. Note: It is anticipated that the IISD will be available on July 13, 2001.   Posted by TRACS on July 11, 2001 at 07:10:16: Two decisions have been made that will affect 201B software development activities: 1. Housing will not require owners and management agents to submit the voucher detail records, included in the 201B Industry Specification, until TRACS is prepared to accept them. This will not be before late 2002. However, if the PB CAs require owners and management agents to submit the voucher detail, the formats in the Industry Specification are the standard for software development. Any additional data elements required by PB CAs should be communicated to TRACS (TRACS@HUD.gov), and, when approved by Housing, they will be added to the standard formats. The transition from SprintMail to TRACSMail, which must be accomplished before 12/31/2001, has added an additional level of stress and urgency to the deployment of software. Housing has removed the voucher detail support as a software requirement to remove a significant new feature from the development/testing/deployment timeline. 2. TRACS 201A data will be accepted via SprintMail until 12/31/2001. It will also be accepted via TRACSMail from the time TRACSMail is made available. Once 201A data is submitted via TRACSMail, all subsequent submissions and return transmissions must be via TRACSMail. The requirements for communicating via TRACSMail will be published as soon as they can be confirmed with Sprint. At a minimum, a computer capable of supporting a browser will be required, and 56kb modems will be supported. HUD considers necessary hardware/software upgrades to be operating expenses.   Posted by TRACS on July 10, 2001 at 07:05:48: Two decisions have been made that will affect 201B software development activities: 1.

Thank you for your patience.   Posted by TRACS on June 18, 2001 at 09:48:19: The MAT15s submitted between the last week of January and April 17 have been reprocessed. Starting tonight, 6/18/01, TRACS will begin processing those MAT15s that were submitted after the processing of MAT15s was suspended. You will receive the messages on these MAT15s. If the same MAT15s were submitted more than once, you may see some additional error messages that you would not normally see. When the MAT15 processing has caught up and returned to current processing another announcement will be posted.   Posted by TRACS on June 01, 2001 at 06:40:45: TRACS discovered that MAT15s were not updating the address database properly under certain circumstances. To avoid compounding the problem, TRACS suspended processing of MAT15s on April 17. TRACS Production Control placed a stop order on the purge of backup MAT input files when the suspension occurred. W ith this action, we were able to preserve the MAT input files from late January forward. The program problem has now been fixed and thoroughly tested. TRACS is starting today to reprocess the MAT15s chronologically as they were received starting with the last week in January. MAT15s received from the last week in January to April 17 will be reprocessed, but no messages will be returned. The messages would just duplicate what you have already received. As we bring the address processing forward from April 17 to current, the messages will be returned since you haven't seen these messages before. We will post another notice when our processing is on a current nightly cycle.   Posted by TRACS on June 14, 2001 at 08:02:33: As of April 30th, 2001, TRACS June Industry Meeting Canelled   Posted by TRACS on June 06, 2001 at 07:54:31: Following the May Industry meeting, Sprint presented their implementation plan which had the effect of slipping by one month the 201B implementation dates published in the May update for the 201B Industry specifications. Housing and Sprint are currently in negotiations, and it is unlikely that there will be much, if any, new information to share by mid-June. While we will keep you posted on developments, the Industry Meeting scheduled for June 18th and 19th is premature. We are therefore cancelling the June 18th and 19th meeting dates. The meeting will be rescheduled when the Sprint Email vs SprintMail issues are resolved between Housing and Sprint. We are sorry for any inconveniences causes by these actions.   Posted by TRACS on June 01, 2001 at 06:40:45: TRACS discovered that MAT15s were not updating the address database properly under certain circumstances.

(Eastern) using as input any data transmitted to the TRACS mailbox since the cutoff for the previous evening's production cycle. The data submitted to TRACS via SprintMail is not received on the platform where TRACS resides. The transmissions received are collected and transferred to the TRACS mainframe on an hourly cycle. What we have learned is that the last transfer prior to 6:00 P.M. is performed at approximately 4:30. There are production control procedures performed by the data center for the last transfer before the production cycle that adds about a half hour. What gets transferred at 4:30 are completed SprintMail transmissions. Our recommendation is that TRACS users plan to complete transmitting the last data for a TRACS production cycle by 4:00 P.M. (Eastern). We also recommend that you make multiple transmissions during the workday or overnight instead of holding everything for a transmission before 4:00 P.M. We aren't sure what the limit is, but apparently there is a limit to the amount of data that can be transferred in a single transfer session. A single session will obviously handle a large amount of data, but if everyone waits until 3:30 to transmit there is the possibility that not everyone will make it into that night's TRACS production cycle.   Posted by TRACS on April 30, 2001 at 12:19:01: TRACS Industry Meeting On SprintMail Replacement May 3 & 4, 2001 HUD HQ Building 451 Seventh Street, SW Washington, DC AGENDA May 3, 2001 Meeting Room: Departmental Conference Room, 10233 Focus: General meeting for owners, management agents, contract administrators, software vendors and service bureaus to discuss how the short-term replacement for SprintMail will affect them, and to participate in defining the interface requirements with the longerterm Internet solution. 10:00 Welcome 10:15 Overview of the short-term SprintMail Replacement and the longerterm Internet solution. 11:00 Short Term - Sprint customized HUD Email System General presentation by Sprint followed by open discussion. 12:00 Lunch 1:00 General Q & A regarding the Sprint customized HUD Email System (Technical Details discussed in May 4th session) 1:30 Release 201B Update 2:30 Break 2:45 User Interface Requirements for the Internet Solution 4:00 Conclude General Session TRACS Industry Meeting On SprintMail Replacement May 3 & 4, 2001 HUD HQ Building 451 Seventh Street, SW Washington, DC   AGENDA May 4, 2001 Meeting Room: B180/182 Focus: Technical meeting for software developers supporting owners, management agents, contract administrators, and service bureaus. 9:00 Welcome 9:15 Recap general overview of Sprint customized HUD Email System 9:30 Technical presentation of HUD Email System by Sprint 10:00 Define Industry technical interface requirements 10:30 Break 10:45 Testing, Pilot Operation and 201B deployment supporting the HUD Email System. 11:45 Wrap up discussion of the short-term SprintMail replacement 12:00 Lunch 1:00 Planned Internet architecture supporting batch communications.

Want to Learn More, see the following web site: http://www.hud.gov/reac/products/pass/mailings. html   Posted by TRACS on March 15, 2001 at 10:55:27: Thursday, March 15th, 2001 The technical staff is continuing to resolve the database issues caused by Monday, March 12th's power outage. At this time, the Web TRACS queries are still unavailable. Once the technical staff can determine a date and time that access to the Web will be available, a notice will be posted to the Forum. We apologize for the inconvenience.   Posted by TRACS on March 14, 2001 at 14:37:45: Under TRACS Release 201A theld 31: Total Regular Payment Amount MAT30, Section 2, Field 33: Total Adjusted Payment Amount MAT30, Section 2, Field 34: Voucher Authorized Unrequested Amount Note: Usually zero.

As a result, the production database server experienced unrecoverable errors. The server will be taken off line today assess the impacts and to determine the best recovery option. A ""Sorry"" page has been put in place for the WEB applications. An announcement will be posted once the assessment has been completed.   Posted by TRACS on February 01, 2001 at 14:52:52: TRACS learned that vouchers submitted to TRACS by PB CAs have been rejected as duplicate vouchers when the voucher was processed by TRACS after LOCCS issued the scheduled payment for the month. This was due to a logic error in the TRACS code. TRACS has been corrected to accept the vouchers from PB CAs after the scheduled payment has been issued. This problem may have affected some vouchers for 10/01/2000, 11/01/2000, 12/01/2000, and 1/01/2001. The problem was corrected before the 2/01/2001 scheduled payments were made. Instances where a scheduled payment has been made but there is no voucher in TRACS are apparent when using the Voucher Query. The scheduled payment amount and the voucher month will be populated, but the TRACS processed date and the MAT30 data will be missing. PB CAs who had vouchers rejected by TRACS as duplicate vouchers should resubmit those vouchers to TRACS. If any PB CA would like assistance in identifying the missing vouchers form which a scheduled payment has been made, send your request to TRACS@hud.gov including your CA ID. TRACS will attach the list to your request and return it. We apologize for this inconvenience.   Posted by TRACS on January 25, 2001 at 14:19:57: HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing and TRACS staff invite Contract Administrators (CAs), management agents and software vendors to the next quarterly TRACS/CA Industry Meeting. The meeting is scheduled March 7 and 8, 2001 in Rooms B-180 and B-182, at the HUD Building, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC. While we anticipated meeting in February following NAHMA's Quarterly meeting, we were unable to obtain facilities here at HUD. We hope the date change will permit all interested parties to attend. We anticipate the first day's agenda will be the final specifications for Release 201B for implementation later this year. We understand there is still concern on differing ways to transmit data as well as additional data elements being required by a number of CAs, so we anticipate the second day's agenda will allow discussion and resolution of a number of these issues.   Posted by TRACS on January 25, 2001 at 10:27:05: We were unable to get a location in February to hold the Industry Meeting. We're hoping to put something out on the Forum in a couple of days for a meeting in early March.   Posted by TRACS on January 05, 2001 at 16:07:21: On December 4, 2001, modifications to the TRACS procedures were released into production to allow a move-in to be stored if the effective date of the MI is retroactive (earlier than the most recent certification). The new fatal error F0164 is generated for a move-in if the contract number and project number differ from the contract and project number of the tenant's most recent certification. This release also included modifications to allow initial certification to be stored if the effective date of the IC is retroactive (earlier than most recent certification.). The new fatal error F0168 is generated for an initial certification if the contract number and/or project number differs from the contract/project number of the tenant's most recent certification. Additional modifications were made to the TRACS procedures to edit the ""next recertification date"" field were added to this release. TRACS was originally programmed to accept zeros in the ""next recertification date"" field. Changes have been made to the module to generate F0169 when zeros are submitted in the field.   Posted by TRACS on December 07, 2000 at 16:13:29: TRACS has learned of a problem in retrieving voucher detail reports from the web. This problem occured the first of the month. The problem has been fixed, and the voucher detail reports are now available.   Posted by TRACS on November 15, 2000 at 07:23:41: SSA has indicated that SS/SSI benefits will increase by 3.5 percent in 2001. The increase begins with benefits for SS beneficiaries in January 2001. The increased payment for SSI recipients begins December 29 2000. As TRACS has already published Benefit History Reports for January and February 2001, you will need to multiply the benefit amounts on those reports by 3.5 percent to determine the correct amount/s. We are unsure at this time if TEVS will rerun the January and February files against the SSA database. If these files are not rerun against the SSA databases, please use the calculation in the above paragraph.   Posted by TRACS on October 30, 2000 at 14:06:00: As of 12/30/2000, the TRACS Internet and Intranet Queries are available available for use. Thank you for your patience.   Posted by TRACS on October 24, 2000 at 13:17:39:  The payments that were not posted to the vouchers with an R50 status have been recovered and posted. Several R50 status codes remain. Many of these may have been paid manually. If so, your payment should be in your bank account. You can confirm this with your bank. The payment will not show in TRACS. If the voucher has not been paid, please resubmit the voucher to TRACS as a correction. In the event that the resubmitted voucher is not successful, you may verify if your voucher status by calling the Voucher Processing Division, 800-526-8174, and asking for the specialist that handles the jurisdiction covering your field office   Posted by TRACS on October 23, 2000 at 15:52:21: TRACS staff have identified the problem with accessing TRACS through Secure Systems (WASS). Unfortunately, the problem is related to TRACS. We apologize for the inconvenience. TRACS is currently testing the software fix. Once testing is complete, the upgraded software will be released as an emergency, ASAP.   Posted by TRACS on October 20, 2000 at 08:00:04: HUD/Industry Standardization Meeting October 23, 2000 10:00 A.M.

Our users are unable to access the data listed in the TRACS Voucher Query and the TRACS Project/Contract Query via the Web. The error messages our users receive, reflect a server error. TRACS is communicating with the administrators of the Web server(s) to determine the cause of the problem with focus on providing a resolution. This problem is outside of the TRACS scope. However, TRACS is committed to rectifying the problem as expeditiously as possible. We will keep you posted of the outcome. Thank you   Posted by TRACS on October 17, 2000 at 11:36:13: After experiencing some delay in processing over the weekend, over 100,000 voucher records (one voucher may require multiple records) have been processed. The remaining backlog of 19,000 voucher records will be included with tonight's normal processing cycle. Voucher processing will be current by start of business Wednesday morning. The recovery of the paid confirmations for those voucher occurrences that currently show an R50 status should also be completed by Wednesday morning.   Posted by TRACS on October 16, 2000 at 12:56:32: The voucher processing problem that was experienced last week has been corrected. However, TRACS has a significant backlog of voucher transmissions yet to be processed. In order for TRACS to begin the task of processing the backlog, specific files must be in place. TRACS is is asking that you NOT try to access the Voucher Query and the Voucher Prepayment Query screens for today (October 16, 2000) ONLY. Thanks   Posted by TRACS on October 12, 2000 at 10:11:01: TRACS is experiencing an extremely large backlog of tenant transmissions. Since To date, there are approximately 140 thousand records in the queue to be processed. Since the backlogged of records will be handled on a first-in first-out basis, there may be up to a two day delay in processing. TRACS will keep you posted of the progress.   Posted by TRACS on October 12, 2000 at 09:56:43: October 6, 2000 Dear Owners and Agents: I am writing this letter to clarify the Department's expectations concerning the Calendar Year 1998 Computer Matching Income Verification Program. As you know, HUD has been working hard to improve federal housing programs and increase the availability of affordable housing and community development resources throughout America. An important part of this effort is strengthening the integrity of its rental assistance programs by ensuring that the programs serve only eligible households with the correct amount of assistance. HUD is undertaking the Tenant Income Verification (TIV) program to assist owners/agents in determining the correct annual income and rent payment for your tenants. HUD's priority in the first year of the program is simply to identify where there are actual discrepancies between income and rental assistance levels. It is essential to the success of the program, therefore, that owners/agents quickly evaluate the potential income discrepancies identified by the TIV program and report on the results. As you know, we have indicated in the Income Discrepancy Resolution Guide, Release 1.8, that HUD will not require or encourage owners/agents to make rental adjustments for prior years for income underreported in 1998 that is identified during the TIV process for that year. We have also stated that we will not require or encourage owners/agents to seek repayment. However, owners/agents may choose to recover excess rental assistance where the underreporting of the income was egregious. It has been pointed out to us that our plan for the baseline year is inconsistent with HUD handbook guidance, particularly Handbook 4350.3. This letter is to advise you that the guidance provided in HUD handbooks, including Handbook 4350.3, is superseded by the policy contained in this letter and the Calendar Year 1998 Income Discrepancy Resolution Guide, Release 1.8, for the computer matching and income verification process. We are confident that the effort you are putting into this initiative will go far in reaching our goal of increasing the public trust in HUD's rental assistance programs. Your continued participation and cooperation is greatly appreciated. Sincerely, /s/ W illiam C. Apgar Assistant Secretary for Housing Federal Housing Commissioner   Posted by TRACS on October 06, 2000 at 12:41:29: Effective immediately, TRACS is temporarily suspending voucher processing to correct anomolies in the TRACS Voucher/Payment batch system related to processing correction vouchers and posting payments to correction vouchers. We expect to have the corrected code in production by October 12 with the voucher backlog brought current by October 16. TRACS Tenant processing is not affected by the suspension of voucher processing. Vouchers can continue to be submitted, but they will be queued up and released for processing beginning with the October 12 cycle on a FIFO basis. We do not recommend the continued submission of correction vouchers until after October 16. You may find that the problem you are hoping to correct is already fixed.   Posted by TRACS on September 28, 2000 at 12:31:20: TRACS is experiencing problems processing voucher corrections. In the last several days, voucher corrections have received a status code of R50 which states that ""the transaction submitted to LOCCS is either a voucher correction or voucher deletion. The correction or deletion is rejected by LOCCS because the voucher being addressed is not in LOCCS."" This status code and explanation are incorrect. Voucher corrections are in LOCCS and are being staged for payment. The voucher delete process is not affected. TRACS is working to resolve this problem. If you receive a R50 on a correction voucher, please DO NOT resubmit that voucher. We will let you know when the fix is implemented.   Posted by TRACS on September 28, 2000 at 09:56:41:  Benefit History Reports for November 2000 recertifications were sent using SprintMail on July 24, 2000. Those for December 2000 recertifications were sent on August 21, 2000. The Reports for January 2001 recertifications were sent September 21, 2000. If you did not receive some you were anticipating, request them using the Project/Contract Query on the Internet. Those requested will become part of the October request from SSA.   Posted by TRACS on September 27, 2000 at 12:36:52: HUD/Industry Standardization Meeting HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing and TRACS staff invite Contract Administrators (CAs) and software vendors to a Standardization Meeting on October 23, 2000 (beginning at 10 AM) in the Departmental Conference Room 10233, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC. We must implement enforceable standards for data collection, security, transmissions and algorithms used to compute assistance and adjustments. This endeavor affects all aspects of TRACS and CA initiatives; i.e., data communication between owners/agents and CAs or TRACS and data communication between CAs and TRACS. This meeting will define data collection and communication standards that comply with HUD's data security standards. We will also discuss standard algorithms with the aim of establishing standard interpretation of effective dates and computation practices. We invite interested parties to attend. However, we need persons authorized to make decisions affecting procedures and product development in attendance. As we have indicated earlier, we want to include additional data elements that are required by state jurisdictions in the published standard. To include these elements we must receive the data element specifications along with the legal mandate for their collection. We anticipate that technical working groups will be held the following day, October 24, 2000, to continue the batch internet transmission discussions held earlier this summer, as well as continue activites from the previous day.   Posted by TRACS on September 11, 2000 at 13:49:21: The following Tenant Messages are effective as of September 8th.

All voucher processing should be current by 6:00a.m 8/22/2000. The new release of the TRACS Voucher/Payment System supporting the new CA requirements was moved to production Friday, August 18. This release includes moving threshold edits from LOCCS to TRACS. Before the nightly cycle could be executed, a table with the threshold values had to be loaded. The program loading the DB2 table failed. It has been fixed and the threshold values have been successfully loaded. The TRACS Voucher/Payment cycle will be run tonight including both the Friday night input and today's input. TRACS Voucher/Payment should be current by tomorrow (Tuesday) morning.   Posted by TRACS on August 17, 2000 at 12:23:14: Release 201B Spec is in the TRACS Documents   Posted by TRACS on August 15, 2000 at 07:30:07: REAC has posted the final Discrepancy Resolution Guide. Two distance learning broadcasts are scheduled for August 22 and 25, 2000. Both broadcasts are from 1 PM to 4 PM Eastern Standard Time. As there have been a number of significant changes in the guide, you may wish to attend one of these sessions even if you attended one in March. Give your local HUD Office a call to reserve a seat for one of these broadcasts. You should also download a copy of the Guide from the REAC Web side before attending. The URL is http://www.hud.gov/reac/products/tass/tass_guide_poa.html   Posted by TRACS on August 03, 2000 at 08:40:45: Early this week, TRACS was notified of a problem with TRACS users receiving acknowledgments and TRACS processing messages. Research determined that TRACS received input data, processed the data, updated TRACS tables and created message files. All voucher data was and is currently being processed and posted to LOCCS for payment. It was discovered that on July 21, modifications to the Sprint transmission code prevented TRACS processing messages from being returned to our users. The Sprint transmission code has been corrected. All TRACS processing messages from July 21 is being retransmitted to all TRACS users.   Posted by TRACS on July 31, 2000 at 13:01:16: The error in the Special Claim ID edit that was rejecting Special Claims that have the Area and Office codes in the first four positions has been corrected. The corrected software is scheduled to be implemented into production on Friday, July 28, 2000. Any vouchers with Special Claims that were submitted on or after July 14 and rejected due to a bad Claim ID should be resubmitted. Voucher resubmitted before the end of July will still be paid as of August 1.   Posted by TRACS on July 20, 2000 at 11:41:02: A new version of the voucher edit program was implemented July 14, 2000. We have discovered that there is an error in the Special Claim Id edit that is rejecting Special Claims that have the Area and Office codes in the first four positions. TRACS is expediting the software correction, and a notice will be posted when the corrected software has been implemented. We anticipate that this will be no later than July 24, 2000. When the notice of the correction has been posted, any vouchers with Special Claims that were submitted on or after July 14 and rejected due to a bad Claim Id should be resubmitted. Voucher resubmitted before the end of July will still be paid as of August 1.   Posted by TRACS on July 17, 2000 at 07:28:44: In February 2000, TRACS posted TRACS 201A Industry Specifications which provided information pertaining to the submission of unit and mailing addresses to the TRACS database. Tenant addresses are required for all projects submitting to TRACS (i.e. subsidy types: BMIR, Rent Supplemental, RAP, Section 236, 202/162 PAC, 202 PRAC and 811 PAC). Perhaps the following excerpts from the TRACS 201A Industry Specifications will provide guidance on what should be submitted to TRACS. Initially, a MAT15 is required to populate the TRACS address database. Thereafter, TRACS will maintain the association between the tenant and the address through move in, move out, initial certifications, unit transfers etc.; provided that, the TRACS data is submitted with a project number. If no project number is submitted to TRACS (non-insured Section 8) a MAT 15 should be submitted with every move-in, initial certification, or unit transfer. If there is a project number, TRACs will maintain the addresses. Input from the Industry has made it clear that the ""Unit Number"" submitted to TRACS in the MAT records is not necessarily the unit number that would be used by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to deliver mail to that unit. The unit number currently submitted to TRACS by some OAs is a construct to satisfy the ""unique unit number within a project"" requirement. Consequently, TRACS is requesting that the Industry submit unit numbers in the MAT ""Unit Number"" fields following a consistent format adopted as the standard for the project. It could be formatted to meet whatever purpose is important to the OA, such as producing reports in unit number sequence......... TRACS will be collecting and maintaining unit addresses. The unit address will be the default mailing address for the tenant. However, there may be legitimate occasions when the tenant's unit address is not their legal mailing address - the address to which the OA mails notices to the tenant. In those cases where the tenant's legal mailing address is not their unit address, the OA is to submit a tenant mailing address transaction to TRACS. The tenant mailing address submission is in addition to the unit address submission, but is required only when the tenant's legal mailing address is not their unit address.   Posted by TRACS on July 13, 2000 at 09:05:39: TRACS will only accept data submitted in the Release 2.0.1.A format effective 8/01/2000. Data submitted to TRACS using the Release 2.0.0.A format will be rejected.   Posted by TRACS on March 13, 2001 at 11:30:49: TRACS did not receive input from SprintMail for the 3/12/2001 processing cycle. The report we have from Lockheed-Martin is that Sprint has the data, and the anomaly that has prevented the download to TRACS has been identified and neutralized. TRACS expects to resume its normal processing cycles tonight, but the missed cycle is likely to cause an overflow of Tenant data into succeeding processing cycles. Any overflow data going into the Friday night cycle will be processed in an expanded processing window.   Posted by TRACS on March 01, 2001 at 12:01:45:  TRACS Industry Meeting, B-180/182 HUD Building, 451 Seventh Street, SW Washington, DC Wednesday, March 7, 2001 Agenda 9:00 Welcome 10:00 Ramifications of Delayed System Funding 10:30 SprintMail Replacement Noon Lunch 1:30 Overview of Release 2.0.1.B. 3:00 Certification History 4:00 Adjourn  Thursday, March 8, 2001 convene at 9 am.   Posted by TRACS on February 28, 2001 at 16:06:25: Effective with the April vouchers, HUD is modifying the PB CA payment process to pay the PB CAs the approved amount from the vouchers they approve instead of issuing the scheduled payment. This process avoids some difficult reconciliation scenarios, and restores some of the communication features that existed when the contracts were HUD Administered. Refer to Fred Tombar's memorandum dated February 7, 2001 for additional background. Vouchers should not be sent to TRACS until they are approved for payment. Note: Under TRACS Release 201A, it will be necessary for the PB CA to modify the MAT30 Section 2 to reflect the approved voucher payment amount if it differs from what the owner/agent requested. Upon receipt of the voucher, TRACS will acknowledge the voucher and return the voucher id. The acknowledgment will be returned to the address of the entity that submitted the voucher to TRACS. This could be returned to the owner/agent by the PB CAs. When the voucher is paid, TRACS will send a payment advice to the entity that submitted the voucher to TRACS. This could be returned to the owner/agent by the PB CAs. Approved vouchers submitted to TRACS by PB CAs are not subjected to the threshold edit that is used for HUD administered vouchers. Consequently, there will be no payment delay due to voucher reviews by the Voucher Processing Division. To facilitate returning messages to the originating owner/agent, the owner/agent's TRACS Mailbox id should be entered into the MATHR (positions 159-168). Positions 169-178 should be blank. TRACS extracts the submitting entity's TRACS Mailbox Id from the Sprint Header and stores both Mailbox Ids together as Sender Id + Site Id. Although, TRACS always transmits to the Sender Id, both Ids are returned. The Site Id can be used by the ""sender"" to forward messages on to the owner/agent using SprintMail. Many PB CAs are using their own TRACS Mailbox Id in the MATHR location causing TRACS to end up with the same Mailbox Id for both the sender and the site. In these cases the PB CA must maintain their own addresses for communicating with their owner/agents.   Posted by TRACS on February 28, 2001 at 16:06:25: Effective with the April vouchers, HUD is modifying the PB CA payment process to pay the PB CAs the approved amount from the vouchers they approve instead of issuing the scheduled payment.

Previously, the primary voucher edits were performed in LOCCS and the pending vouchers were warehoused in LOCCS. Any voucher rejected by LOCCS had already been accepted by TRACS. Based on the rule that two original vouchers could not be processed for a given voucher month, the rejected voucher had to be resubmitted as a correction to make it past the edit. Now TRACS is managing the pending vouchers. Consequently, once a voucher has been accepted by TRACS, TRACS has the ability to manage that voucher until it is paid or terminally rejected. TRACS has been adding code to eliminate the requirement for resubmitting rejected vouchers as corrections. Currently the following status codes do not require resubmission of the voucher at all: R26 - Insufficient Funds: Rejected by LOCCS. The field office can accept the voucher for payment when LOCCS has recorded the funding. Additionally, TRACS will automatically send the voucher to LOCCS once a week until the voucher is paid or cancelled by the field office. R41 - Expired Contract: Rejected by LOCCS. T41 - Expired Contract: Pending in TRACS. When the contract is renewed the voucher will automatically be released to LOCCS for payment. In these cases there is really nothing the owner/agent can do other than alert the field office to theirsituation. Reentering the voucher as a correction will not speed up payment, but it could delay payment, and it will certainly add to the confusion. By April 1, 2001 there will be additional voucher reject situations that will require only reentry of an original voucher. The status codes and the suggested action will be posted prior to April 1. TRACS is working toward the goal of requiring correction vouchers only in legitimate correction situations.   Posted by TRACS on February 01, 2001 at 14:52:52: TRACS learned that vouchers submitted to TRACS by PB CAs have been rejected as duplicate vouchers when the voucher was processed by TRACS after LOCCS issued the scheduled payment for the month. This was due to a logic error in the TRACS code. TRACS has been corrected to accept the vouchers from PB CAs after the scheduled payment has been issued. This problem may have affected some vouchers for 10/01/2000, 11/01/2000, 12/01/2000, and 1/01/2001. The problem was corrected before the 2/01/2001 scheduled payments were made. Instances where a scheduled payment has been made but there is no voucher in TRACS are apparent when using the Voucher Query. The scheduled payment amount and the voucher month will be populated, but the TRACS processed date and the MAT30 data will be missing. PB CAs who had vouchers rejected by TRACS as duplicate vouchers should resubmit those vouchers to TRACS. If any PB CA would like assistance in identifying the missing vouchers for which a scheduled payment has been made, send your request to TRACS@hud.gov including your CA ID. TRACS will attach the list to your request and return it. We apologize for this inconvenience.   Posted by TRACS on January 25, 2001 at 14:19:57: HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing and TRACS staff invite Contract Administrators (CAs), management agents and software vendors to the next quarterly TRACS/CA Industry Meeting. The meeting is scheduled March 7 and 8, 2001 in Rooms B-180 and B-182, at the HUD Building, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC. While we anticipated meeting in February following NAHMA's Quarterly meeting, we were unable to obtain facilities here at HUD. We hope the date change will permit all interested parties to attend. We anticipate the first day's agenda will be the final specifications for Release 201B for implementation later this year. We understand there is still concern on differing ways to transmit data as well as additional data elements being required by a number of CAs, so we anticipate the second day's agenda will allow discussion and resolution of a number of these issues.   Posted by TRACS on January 25, 2001 at 10:27:05: We were unable to get a location in February to hold the Industry Meeting. We're hoping to put something out on the Forum in a couple of days for a meeting in early March.   Posted by TRACS on January 05, 2001 at 16:07:21: On December 4, 2001, modifications to the TRACS procedures were released into production to allow a move-in to be stored if the effective date of the MI is retroactive (earlier than the most recent certification). The new fatal error F0164 is generated for a move-in if the contract number and project number differ from the contract and project number of the tenant's most recent certification. This release also included modifications to allow initial certification to be stored if the effective date of the IC is retroactive (earlier than most recent certification.). The new fatal error F0168 is generated for an initial certification if the contract number and/or project number differs from the contract/project number of the tenant's most recent certification. Additional modifications were made to the TRACS procedures to edit the ""next recertification date"" field were added to this release. TRACS was originally programmed to accept zeros in the ""next recertification date"" field. Changes have been made to the module to generate F0169 when zeros are submitted in the field.   Posted by TRACS on December 07, 2000 at 16:13:29: TRACS has learned of a problem in retrieving voucher detail reports from the web. This problem occured the first of the month. The problem has been fixed, and the voucher detail reports are now available.   Posted by TRACS on December 07, 2000 at 16:13:29: TRACS has learned of a problem in retrieving voucher detail reports from the web. This problem occured the first of the month. The problem has been fixed, and the voucher detail reports are now available.   Posted by TRACS on November 15, 2000 at 07:23:41: SSA has indicated that SS/SSI benefits will increase by 3.5 percent in 2001. The increase begins with benefits for SS beneficiaries in January 2001. The increased payment for SSI recipients begins December 29 2000. As TRACS has already published Benefit History Reports for January and February 2001, you will need to multiply the benefit amounts on those reports by 3.5 percent to determine the correct amount/s. We are unsure at this time if TEVS will rerun the January and February files against the SSA database. If these files are not rerun against the SSA databases, please use the calculation in the above paragraph.   Posted by TRACS on October 30, 2000 at 14:06:00: As of 12/30/2000, the TRACS Internet and Intranet Queries are available available for use. Thank you for your patience.   Posted by TRACS on October 24, 2000 at 13:17:39:  The payments that were not posted to the vouchers with an R50 status have been recovered and posted. Several R50 status codes remain. Many of these may have been paid manually. If so, your payment should be in your bank account. You can confirm this with your bank. The payment will not show in TRACS. If the voucher has not been paid, please resubmit the voucher to TRACS as a correction. In the event that the resubmitted voucher is not successful, you may verify if your voucher status by calling the Voucher Processing Division, 800-526-8174, and asking for the specialist that handles the jurisdiction covering your field office   Posted by TRACS on October 23, 2000 at 15:52:21: TRACS staff have identified the problem with accessing TRACS through Secure Systems (WASS). Unfortunately, the problem is related to TRACS. We apologize for the inconvenience. TRACS is currently testing the software fix. Once testing is complete, the upgraded software will be released as an emergency, ASAP.   Posted by TRACS on October 20, 2000 at 08:00:04: HUD/Industry Standardization Meeting October 23, 2000 10:00 A.M.

Our users are unable to access the data listed in the TRACS Voucher Query and the TRACS Project/Contract Query via the Web. The error messages our users receive, reflect a server error. TRACS is communicating with the administrators of the Web server(s) to determine the cause of the problem with focus on providing a resolution. This problem is outside of the TRACS scope. However, TRACS is committed to rectifying the problem as expeditiously as possible. We will keep you posted of the outcome. Thank you   Posted by TRACS on October 17, 2000 at 11:36:13: After experiencing some delay in processing over the weekend, over 100,000 voucher records (one voucher may require multiple records) have been processed. The remaining backlog of 19,000 voucher records will be included with tonight's normal processing cycle. Voucher processing will be current by start of business Wednesday morning. The recovery of the paid confirmations for those voucher occurrences that currently show an R50 status should also be completed by Wednesday morning.   Posted by TRACS on October 16, 2000 at 12:56:32: The voucher processing problem that was experienced last week has been corrected. However, TRACS has a significant backlog of voucher transmissions yet to be processed. In order for TRACS to begin the task of processing the backlog, specific files must be in place. TRACS is is asking that you NOT try to access the Voucher Query and the Voucher Prepayment Query screens for today (October 16, 2000) ONLY. Thanks   Posted by TRACS on October 12, 2000 at 10:11:01: TRACS is experiencing an extremely large backlog of tenant transmissions. Since To date, there are approximately 140 thousand records in the queue to be processed. Since the backlogged of records will be handled on a first-in first-out basis, there may be up to a two day delay in processing. TRACS will keep you posted of the progress.   Posted by TRACS on October 12, 2000 at 09:56:43: October 6, 2000 Dear Owners and Agents: I am writing this letter to clarify the Department's expectations concerning the Calendar Year 1998 Computer Matching Income Verification Program. As you know, HUD has been working hard to improve federal housing programs and increase the availability of affordable housing and community development resources throughout America. An important part of this effort is strengthening the integrity of its rental assistance programs by ensuring that the programs serve only eligible households with the correct amount of assistance. HUD is undertaking the Tenant Income Verification (TIV) program to assist owners/agents in determining the correct annual income and rent payment for your tenants. HUD's priority in the first year of the program is simply to identify where there are actual discrepancies between income and rental assistance levels. It is essential to the success of the program, therefore, that owners/agents quickly evaluate the potential income discrepancies identified by the TIV program and report on the results. As you know, we have indicated in the Income Discrepancy Resolution Guide, Release 1.8, that HUD will not require or encourage owners/agents to make rental adjustments for prior years for income underreported in 1998 that is identified during the TIV process for that year. We have also stated that we will not require or encourage owners/agents to seek repayment. However, owners/agents may choose to recover excess rental assistance where the underreporting of the income was egregious. It has been pointed out to us that our plan for the baseline year is inconsistent with HUD handbook guidance, particularly Handbook 4350.3. This letter is to advise you that the guidance provided in HUD handbooks, including Handbook 4350.3, is superseded by the policy contained in this letter and the Calendar Year 1998 Income Discrepancy Resolution Guide, Release 1.8, for the computer matching and income verification process. We are confident that the effort you are putting into this initiative will go far in reaching our goal of increasing the public trust in HUD's rental assistance programs. Your continued participation and cooperation is greatly appreciated. Sincerely, /s/ W illiam C. Apgar Assistant Secretary for Housing Federal Housing Commissioner   Posted by TRACS on October 06, 2000 at 12:41:29: Effective immediately, TRACS is temporarily suspending voucher processing to correct anomolies in the TRACS Voucher/Payment batch system related to processing correction vouchers and posting payments to correction vouchers. We expect to have the corrected code in production by October 12 with the voucher backlog brought current by October 16. TRACS Tenant processing is not affected by the suspension of voucher processing. Vouchers can continue to be submitted, but they will be queued up and released for processing beginning with the October 12 cycle on a FIFO basis. We do not recommend the continued submission of correction vouchers until after October 16. You may find that the problem you are hoping to correct is already fixed.   Posted by TRACS on September 28, 2000 at 12:31:20: TRACS is experiencing problems processing voucher corrections. In the last several days, voucher corrections have received a status code of R50 which states that ""the transaction submitted to LOCCS is either a voucher correction or voucher deletion. The correction or deletion is rejected by LOCCS because the voucher being addressed is not in LOCCS."" This status code and explanation are incorrect. Voucher corrections are in LOCCS and are being staged for payment. The voucher delete process is not affected. TRACS is working to resolve this problem. If you receive a R50 on a correction voucher, please DO NOT resubmit that voucher. We will let you know when the fix is implemented.   Posted by TRACS on September 28, 2000 at 09:56:41:  Benefit History Reports for November 2000 recertifications were sent using SprintMail on July 24, 2000. Those for December 2000 recertifications were sent on August 21, 2000. The Reports for January 2001 recertifications were sent September 21, 2000. If you did not receive some you were anticipating, request them using the Project/Contract Query on the Internet. Those requested will become part of the October request from SSA.   Posted by TRACS on September 27, 2000 at 12:36:52: HUD/Industry Standardization Meeting HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing and TRACS staff invite Contract Administrators (CAs) and software vendors to a Standardization Meeting on October 23, 2000 (beginning at 10 AM) in the Departmental Conference Room 10233, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC. We must implement enforceable standards for data collection, security, transmissions and algorithms used to compute assistance and adjustments. This endeavor affects all aspects of TRACS and CA initiatives; i.e., data communication between owners/agents and CAs or TRACS and data communication between CAs and TRACS. This meeting will define data collection and communication standards that comply with HUD's data security standards. We will also discuss standard algorithms with the aim of establishing standard interpretation of effective dates and computation practices. We invite interested parties to attend. However, we need persons authorized to make decisions affecting procedures and product development in attendance. As we have indicated earlier, we want to include additional data elements that are required by state jurisdictions in the published standard. To include these elements we must receive the data element specifications along with the legal mandate for their collection. We anticipate that technical working groups will be held the following day, October 24, 2000, to continue the batch internet transmission discussions held earlier this summer, as well as continue activites from the previous day.   Posted by TRACS on September 11, 2000 at 13:49:21: The following Tenant Messages are effective as of September 8th. New Tenant Messages Effective with the September LM110 Release Fatal error Code: F0034 Description: (Text Modification) MOVEOUT DATE OUT OF RANGE OF CERTIFICATION DATE(S) CERT EFFECT DATE GREATER THAN MOVEOUT DATE: OR NEXT RECERT DATE + 1 MO.

All voucher processing should be current by 6:00a.m 8/22/2000. The new release of the TRACS Voucher/Payment System supporting the new CA requirements was moved to production Friday, August 18. This release includes moving threshold edits from LOCCS to TRACS. Before the nightly cycle could be executed, a table with the threshold values had to be loaded. The program loading the DB2 table failed. It has been fixed and the threshold values have been successfully loaded. The TRACS Voucher/Payment cycle will be run tonight including both the Friday night input and today's input. TRACS Voucher/Payment should be current by tomorrow (Tuesday) morning.   Posted by TRACS on August 17, 2000 at 12:23:14: Release 201B Spec is in the TRACS Documents   Posted by TRACS on August 15, 2000 at 07:30:07: REAC has posted the final Discrepancy Resolution Guide. Two distance learning broadcasts are scheduled for August 22 and 25, 2000. Both broadcasts are from 1 PM to 4 PM Eastern Standard Time. As there have been a number of significant changes in the guide, you may wish to attend one of these sessions even if you attended one in March. Give your local HUD Office a call to reserve a seat for one of these broadcasts. You should also download a copy of the Guide from the REAC Web side before attending. The URL is http://www.hud.gov/reac/products/tass/tass_guide_poa.html   Posted by TRACS on August 03, 2000 at 08:40:45: Early this week, TRACS was notified of a problem with TRACS users receiving acknowledgments and TRACS processing messages. Research determined that TRACS received input data, processed the data, updated TRACS tables and created message files. All voucher data was and is currently being processed and posted to LOCCS for payment. It was discovered that on July 21, modifications to the Sprint transmission code prevented TRACS processing messages from being returned to our users. The Sprint transmission code has been corrected. All TRACS processing messages from July 21 is being retransmitted to all TRACS users.   Posted by TRACS on July 31, 2000 at 13:01:16: The error in the Special Claim ID edit that was rejecting Special Claims that have the Area and Office codes in the first four positions has been corrected. The corrected software is scheduled to be implemented into production on Friday, July 28, 2000. Any vouchers with Special Claims that were submitted on or after July 14 and rejected due to a bad Claim ID should be resubmitted. Voucher resubmitted before the end of July will still be paid as of August 1.   Posted by TRACS on July 20, 2000 at 11:41:02: A new version of the voucher edit program was implemented July 14, 2000. We have discovered that there is an error in the Special Claim Id edit that is rejecting Special Claims that have the Area and Office codes in the first four positions. TRACS is expediting the software correction, and a notice will be posted when the corrected software has been implemented. We anticipate that this will be no later than July 24, 2000. When the notice of the correction has been posted, any vouchers with Special Claims that were submitted on or after July 14 and rejected due to a bad Claim Id should be resubmitted. Voucher resubmitted before the end of July will still be paid as of August 1.   Posted by TRACS on July 17, 2000 at 07:28:44: In February 2000, TRACS posted TRACS 201A Industry Specifications which provided information pertaining to the submission of unit and mailing addresses to the TRACS database. Tenant addresses are required for all projects submitting to TRACS (i.e. subsidy types: BMIR, Rent Supplemental, RAP, Section 236, 202/162 PAC, 202 PRAC and 811 PAC). Perhaps the following excerpts from the TRACS 201A Industry Specifications will provide guidance on what should be submitted to TRACS. Initially, a MAT15 is required to populate the TRACS address database. Thereafter, TRACS will maintain the association between the tenant and the address through move in, move out, initial certifications, unit transfers etc.; provided that, the TRACS data is submitted with a project number. If no project number is submitted to TRACS (non-insured Section 8) a MAT 15 should be submitted with every move-in, initial certification, or unit transfer. If there is a project number, TRACs will maintain the addresses. Input from the Industry has made it clear that the ""Unit Number"" submitted to TRACS in the MAT records is not necessarily the unit number that would be used by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to deliver mail to that unit. The unit number currently submitted to TRACS by some OAs is a construct to satisfy the ""unique unit number within a project"" requirement. Consequently, TRACS is requesting that the Industry submit unit numbers in the MAT ""Unit Number"" fields following a consistent format adopted as the standard for the project. It could be formatted to meet whatever purpose is important to the OA, such as producing reports in unit number sequence......... TRACS will be collecting and maintaining unit addresses. The unit address will be the default mailing address for the tenant. However, there may be legitimate occasions when the tenant's unit address is not their legal mailing address - the address to which the OA mails notices to the tenant. In those cases where the tenant's legal mailing address is not their unit address, the OA is to submit a tenant mailing address transaction to TRACS. The tenant mailing address submission is in addition to the unit address submission, but is required only when the tenant's legal mailing address is not their unit address.   Posted by TRACS on July 13, 2000 at 09:05:39: TRACS will only accept data submitted in the Release 2.0.1.A format effective 8/01/2000. Data submitted to TRACS using the Release 2.0.0.A format will be rejected.   Posted by TRACS on July 12, 2000 at 07:44:09: 1. TRACS Today. The technology behind the current TRACS System. Actual transaction volume, size of the database, purging and backup procedures. 2. TRACS Tomorrow. Projections of the Multifamily and the new Contract Administrators needs. Projected transaction volume. 3. Current TRACS Internet blueprints and timelines. 4. Other HUD Internet applications. 5. TRACS' Concerns: Security in a batch environment Infrastructure to handle the volume 6. General discussion on possible back-end solutions. 7. Other. Note: This symposium is intended to be a technical session addressing the security and volume issues TRACS must deal with as it migrates from SprintMail to the Internet as its batch data communication vehicle. Symposium Time/Location 9:30 to 5:00 Wednesday, July 26, 2000 AMA (American Management Association) 440 First Street, NW W ashington DC 20001 ROOM 102 202-347-3092 Notes: AMA is located 3 blocks from Judiciary Square and Union Station Metro Station. Parking available in the building garage ($8.50 a day) Beverage service will be provided. The meeting room will comfortably accommodate 25 people.   Posted by TRACS on July 07, 2000 at 07:13:55: HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center has mailed about 57,000 letters to tenants receiving benefits from the Office of Housing's programs. Although mailings to tenants were suspended in late June 2000, it is anticipated that additional mailings will occur later this month. Notices to owners listing tenants who have been or will be sent letters have been mailed to all owners who have tenants with potential income discrepancies; the identification of those tenants is available to owners and agents on the Internet. If an owner has no tenants with potential income discrepancies, the owner will not receive a mailing from HUD. Please check the following site ""www.hud.gov/reac/products"" and select Tenant Income Verification for additional information. If you have questions, please call 1-888-708-8277.   Posted by TRACS on June 30, 2000 at 10:40:27:  Benefit History Reports of SS/SSI information for recertifications effective October 2000 were sent via SprintMail on 6/19/00.   Posted by TRACS on June 26, 2000 at 10:00:38: The Computer Matching Income Verification broadcast today, June 26, 2000 from 1 PM to 4 PM Eastern Standard Time has been cancelled. As soon as it has been rescheduled, we will again post the date and time. Sorry for any inconvenience this presents to you.   Posted by TRACS on June 19, 2000 at 11:14:53: F0023 Occurs when an O/A submits a MAT10 that should have a project number, but doesn't. TRACS uses the subsidy type and the secondary subsidy to make this determination. MAT10s requiring a project number are: Section 8 with a secondary subsidy of ""S"" (236) Rent Supplement RAP Section 236 BMIR 202/PAC 202 PRAC 811 PRAC FA001- No Project number submitted when required by Mat15. Occures when a MAT15 for a Section 8 contract is submitted without a project number. NOTE: This is a TRACS error. The project number is an optional field for MAT15s submitted for Section 8 contracts. The MAT 15 doesn't deal with secondary subsidy types which could force a Section 8 to have a project number. The error is in the process of being fixed. A notice will be posted when the fix is implemented. F0141 W hen an O/A submits a MAT10 unit transfer, if the contract has been combined, the previous contract number submitted on the MAT10 should equal the previous contract number stored in the tenant's most recent certification. When the two contract numbers differ, F0141 is generated. NOTE: TRACS is reviewing the logic for this situation. It appears that a condition was omitted from the code. F0139 When an O/A submits a MAT10 unit transfer, if the contract HAS NOT been combined, the previous contract number submitted on the MAT10 should equal the contract number stored in the tenant's most recent certification. When the two contract numbers differ, F0139 is generated. F0146 Occurs when an O/A submits an Initial Certification for a tenant but the tenant's current certification in TRACS has not been terminated. Either the subsidy should be terminated for the certification in TRACS prior to entry of the Initial Certification or the MAT10 can be resubmitted with the baseline indicator set to Y. F0123 Occurs when an O/A submits a Move In or Initial Certification for a tenant who has an active certification in TRACS. If the O/A has submitted the 201A format and the error occurs, resubmitting the transaction with the baseline certification indicator set to ""Y"" will override the problem. The workaround for those submitting the 200A format went into production on 6/9/00. TRACS automatically sets the baseline cert indicator to ""Y"" during the conversion from 200A to 201A record formats Move In and Initial Certifications.   Posted by TRACS on June 19, 2000 at 07:01:20: On March 14 and 16, 2000, HUD had broadcasts for Owner/Management Agents and Contract Administrators on Tenant Income Verification (TIV) and the discrepancy resolution process. The broadcast is again being provided on June 26, 2000 from 1 PM to 4 PM Eastern Standard Time for those who may have missed them. Give your local HUD office a call to reserve your seat. You may also wish to download a copy of the draft POA Discrepancy Resolution Guide from the REAC Web site before attending.   Posted by TRACS on June 05, 2000 at 11:38:01: TRACS implemented an updated version of the Voucher process on Friday, June 2. However, problems were encountered with the release. Consequently, no vouchers were processed in the Friday, June 2 nightly batch cycle. Any voucher messages sent to TRACS users on Monday, June 5 should be disregarded. All voucher data that was not processed on Friday will be processed in the Monday, June 5 nightly batch cycle.   Posted by TRACS on June 05, 2000 at 11:36:35: The problems encountered on May 26th with the online TRACS Project/Contract Query have now been resolved. TRACS and the appropriate people resolved the problems with the production server. The query became available at 10 am today. This expanded query includes additional fields and an option to download query results as a comma delimited ASCII file.   Posted by TRACS on June 01, 2000 at 11:21:10: TRACS migrated the new version of the Tenant Query to production Friday, May 26th. Problems with the production server have delayed the implementation of this expanded Tenant query, and, unfortunately, have disabled the old version of the query. TRACS is working with the appropriate people to expedite resolving the problems with the production server. A message will be posted on this forum when the expanded Tenant Query is available. The expanded Tenant Query includes additional fields and an option to download the results of the query as a comma delimited ASCII file.   Posted by TRACS on May 30, 2000 at 13:56:07: The social security (SS) and supplemental security income (SSI) data that was sent on May 22, 2000 via SprintMail indicated that the reports were for recertifications due 2000/07 (i..e. July 2000). The data sent actually is for recertifications scheduled for September 2000 (the correct processing month). We will not be re-sending the SprintMail for September 2000 recertifications since the report data is correct. The SS and SSI reports will be posted on the Internet under the correct month.   Posted by TRACS on May 24, 2000 at 14:57:34: Monday, June 12, 2000, B-180 and B-182 9:30 Welcome 9:45 Tenant Compliance 10:00 INS and their SAVE System 11:00 CA Updates Noon Lunch 1:00 TRACS and CAs June to October 1:30 TRACS Release 2.0.1.B 3:00 Tenant Income Verification Updates 3:45 Questions and Answers   Posted by TRACS on May 18, 2000 at 07:07:30: The TRACS Release 201A implementation deadline, most recently June 1, 2000, has been deferred until August 1, 2000. Only transactions submitted to TRACS with Release/Version 201A will be accepted on or after August 1, 2000. Transactions with any other Release/Version Number will be rejected. Release 201B, planned for October 1, 2000, has therefore been slipped to December 1, 2000.   Posted by TRACS on May 15, 2000 at 09:22:05: By this summer, you will be able to access the TRACS Project/Contract Query and download the queried tenant data to an ASCII file so that you may import it into a Microsoft Access table on your PC.

Also, the matrix table containing details about the Tenant database fields has changed slightly   Posted by TRACS on May 12, 2000 at 07:39:35: The first round of new Section 8 Contract Administrators (CAs) will begin building their baseline databases starting on or about June 1, 2000. Once TRACS receives a submission from a CA, TRACS does not intend to accept submissions for that contract from an owner/agent (OA). The primary issue behind this rule is data quality. If both the OA and the CA are sending data to TRACS for the same contract, TRACS is likely to get confused and both the CA and the OA are likely to become annoyed. TRACS' near term problem is recognizing that the submission is coming from a CA. What we are asking the CAs to do is add to the Mat Transmission Headers (MATHRs) being sent to TRACS their five character CA Id. The CA Id is, in most cases, the two-character state code followed by three digits. Currently those three digits are expected to be 800. TRACS will recognize those submissions with a CA Id as Section 8 CA submissions and modify the acceptance criteria accordingly. This modification to the MATHR affects only the new Section 8 Contract Administrators who will be launched starting June 2000. It does not affect OAs. The modification to the MATHR deals with Field 22, a future field reserved for the count of (future) MAT72 records. This field is being activated for the CA to use to enter their CA Id. The characteristics of the field will change from numeric to alphanumeric to accommodate the CA Id. If a CA does not include their CA Id when they submit their MATHRs, TRACS will not recognize the submission as a new CA submission and subsequent OA submissions, if any, will be accepted and processed by TRACS. Lots of messages are likely. This does not have to be a significant problem if the communications between the CA and the project make it clear that the project should not send data for the CA administered contracts directly to TRACS after the baseline has been established with the CA. If the OA sends data to TRACS anyway, some data quality issues may be created, but they can be fixed downstream. Failure of the CA to include the CA Id in the MATHR is not a showstopper. Payments will not be affected even if data are submitted to TRACS by both the CA and the OA. The transition from LOCCS paying the OA based upon their voucher to paying the CA their scheduled payment based upon their requisition is controlled by receipt of the CAs approved requisition for the contract. Once LOCCS starts scheduled payments based upon the requisition, TRACS will not send payment requests for those vouchers to LOCCS. Vouchers for periods prior to the start of the scheduled payments will still be sent to LOCCS and the payment will be made to the OA.   Posted by TRACS on May 03, 2000 at 08:01:14: We have reserved two of our Training rooms for June 12 and 13, 2000 for an Industry meeting. Monday, June 12, 2000, will be the all day combined meeting of Contract Administrators, software vendors, and management individuals with the Housing and TRACS staff in Rooms B-180 and B-182. Tuesday, June 13, 2000, we can separate these rooms and either run concurrent sessions with (1) the CAs and (2) the software vendors -- or as we have done in the past, the CAs in the morning and the software vendors in the afternoon. We will post an agenda at a later date. Your suggestions for these agenda items are always welcomed. The rooms are located in the HUD Building, 451 Seventh Street, SW. The training rooms are at the North end of the basement.   Posted by TRACS on April 19, 2000 at 09:21:01: TRACS Release 201A Deadline Deferral Owner and Management Agent Transmission to Multiple Addresses TRACS Internet Batch Submission Status TRACS Release 201B Heads-Up CA Developer's Forum 1. TRACS Release 201A deadline deferral: In response to requests for additional time for Release 201A implementation, SCAIT and Housing have agreed to defer the TRACS Release 201A implementation deadline from May 1, 2000 to June 1, 2000. Deferring this deadline carries some consequences: Contract Administrators (CA) for the states of Massachusetts, Michigan and South Dakota are likely to start building their baseline databases on or about June 1. They are likely to be receiving data from owners and management agents (OAs) who are operating under Release 201A. Many OAs are submitting data to TRACS now using the 201A format. These CAs will need to be aware that their data may arrive in either the Release 200A or the Release 201A format. Recommendation: Expedite deployment of Release 201A software based upon the SCAIT implementation schedule. Once a CA forwards baseline tenant data or a voucher to TRACS, TRACS will only accept data for that contract from the CA. The objective is to keep the OA, CA and TRACS databases in synch as much as possible. This means that there may be legacy corrections or retroactive transactions sent to the CA that may need to be simply passed through to TRACS. A baseline indicator was introduced into the HUD50059 record format by Release 201A. The purpose of the indicator is to allow an OA to reestablish their baseline in TRACS without having the HUD50059 rejected or creating an excessive number of discrepancy messages. TRACS is encouraging CAs to send their baseline certifications to TRACS. CAs choosing to establish their baselines in TRACS under Release 200A should anticipate rejections and discrepancy messages related to submitting a certification that already exists in TRACS. Owner and Management Agent Transmission to Multiple Addresses The post-RFP CA will only receive transactions affecting those contracts they administer. Partially assisted projects may have Section 8 contracted units administered by a CA under the rules of the RFP and Section 236 units, or units assisted through other programs, that are not administered by the CA. Conceivably, a single project could have Section 8 contracts administered by a post-RFP CA, Section 8 contracts administered by a different pre-RFP CA, and HUD administered contracts/programs. HUD-50059 and Voucher data for contracts/programs that are not administered by the post-RFP CA must be submitted to the entity that administers that contract/program. OAs that need to submit their data to different addresses based upon the program or contract may need the assistance of their software vendor to appropriately organize their data. If vendors or OAs require advice on how SprintMail should be set up, they can call the TRACS Hotline and ask for the SprintMail technician for set-up assistance. TRACS Internet Batch   Submission Status Although TRACS did launch an exploratory effort on the batch submission of TRACS data via the Internet, this effort has been deferred until October 2000. TRACS' two technical leads on this project succumbed to the allure of the .COM start-ups, and there simply isn't time to recover with a credible program by the time the CA conversions commence. SprintMail will continue to be supported by TRACS for the foreseeable future. New reports being developed to assist HUD offices, OAs and CAs will only be available on the Internet/HUD Intranet. TRACS Release 201B Heads-Up There will be a new TRACS Release 201B with an implementation deadline of October 1, 2000. This release will primarily affect reformatting the Monthly Activity Transmission (MAT) records to collect additional data and to facilitate TRACS production. In addition, new, but future, records and data elements are included in this release in anticipation of upcoming requirements. SCAIT requires the collection of additional data elements from the CAs. Housing has been mandated to collect accessibility data on units. TRACS production considerations require early separation of Tenant and Voucher submissions for the nightly processing cycle to remove the existing dependency on a common MAT subsystem. A preliminary Industry Specification will be published on the TRACS web site by the end of April 2000. CA Developer's Forum TRACS is sponsoring a developer's forum to provide expedited communications between Industry and TRACS development teams. CAs will also be interfacing with other HUD systems such as WASS (Web Application SubSystem), REMS (Real Estate Management System), and LOCCS (Line of Credit Control System). This forum can be used to expedite communication with these application areas as well. This will be a limited access - limited life forum specifically for the CA development lifecycle. Developers who would like to participate in this forum can request access by sending an email to Robert_D._W ilson@hud.gov.   Posted by TRACS on April 07, 2000 at 09:49:37: TRACS extracts household records and transmits them to TASS on a monthly cycle. The selection is made based upon the next recertification date or a benefit history flag set by TRACS or the Internet User requesting a benefit history. The benefit history flag is set by TRACS if a correction or an initial certification is processed after the extract date but before next recertification date. Once TRACS runs the scheduled extract and transmits it to TASS, TRACS has no control over the assembly or distribution of the Benefit History Reports. This is done by TASS with no feedback to TRACS. It is outside of TRACS control. Dates of the generation of the last three monthly Benefit History Reports are 2/16/00 for May; 3/7/00 for June and 3/27/00 for July. We will continue to post the generation date in the future. Questions related to the Benefit History Reports should be directed to the REAC Hotline (TASS is under REAC). That number is 1-888-245-4860.   Posted by TRACS on April 05, 2000 at 09:47:21: Appendix F of the MAT User's Guide has 2 new informational codes: DA012 and DA013 and has been posted on the internet. Appendix F can be found at: www.hud.gov/fha/mfh/trx/pdf/appdxf.pdf.   Posted by TRACS on March 30, 2000 at 14:03:30: TRACS successfully processed the March 10 Tenant cycle last night (3/30). TRACS users are likely to receive some duplicate or peculiar messages while TRACS works through the backlog. Unless advised otherwise before noon on Monday 4/3, you may resume submitting tenant transactions to TRACS for the Monday evening processing cycle. We recommend that owners and management agents verify their tenant status in TRACS after 4/3. Those with Internet access and a M-id permitting access to TRACS can verify the current status of their tenants using the Tenant Query. Those without Internet access may be able to verify the status of specific tenants by requesting assistance from the TRACS Hotline or their HUD Field Office.   Posted by TRACS on March 21, 2000 at 12:24:27: The Census Bureau will be hiring residents of HUD's assisted housing communities to help complete Census 2000. Earnings from the Census for those household members who assist in this endeavor as census takers, enumerators, crew leaders, clerks, etc., are to be excluded from income for a period not to exceed 180 days employment. We understand the Census work will last less than three months and occur during the months of March through July 2000. Please share this information with those who reside in your project.   Posted by TRACS on March 21, 2000 at 08:56:00: TRACS Tenant System is continuing to experience production problems. The TRACS Voucher/Payment System is not experiencing production problems. To minimize the confusion created by the TRACS Tenant production problems, the TRACS Team recommends that owners and management agents hold their tenant transactions until TRACS can resume its normal nightly Tenant production schedule. Voucher data submitted to TRACS will continue to be processed. Priority will be given to ""Voucher Only"" submissions. Payments will continue to be made on schedule for Voucher Only Submissions. There may be a day or two delay on voucher batches combined with tenant batches in the same submission.   Posted by TRACS on March 15, 2000 at 06:56:06: On Friday, 03/10/99, the TRACS nightly cycle did not complete successfully. As a result, the Tenant and SSI Data Match sub-systems did not process correctly. However, the Voucher and Contracts sub-systems were not effected. All vouchers submitted on Friday, 03/10/99 and Monday, 03/13/99 were processed successfully. The TRACS team is currently researching the problem and expect to have the system fully operational as soon as possible. The Tenant data submitted on Friday, 03/10/99 and Monday, 03/13/99 is being accumulated for submission as soon as the Tenant processing problems are resolved. We are very sorry for the inconvenience.   Posted by TRACS on March 13, 2000 at 09:59:03: Update's to the MAT USER GUIDE is now available on the HOME Page under TRACS Documents. Last revised date of 3/2000.   Posted by TRACS on March 07, 2000 at 12:43:09:  As many of you have already experienced, TRACS Tenant Release 201A is incorrectly rejecting transactions submitted using the 200A codes. Examples include rejecting certifications with relationship codes that are valid under 200A, rejecting MAT10s submitted, in some cases, without an address, and accepting MAT transmissions with a Release/Version number of 118B. These problems are being addressed by the TRACS Team and the corrected code will be in production soon. TRACS will post a message when the corrected programs are implemented. Although the transactions rejected in error by TRACS Release 201A will have to be resubmitted, the TRACS Team encourages you to hold the re-submission until the corrected code has been implemented. We apologize for this inconvenience. Voucher transactions can be submitted at any time. They are not affected by the start-up problems experienced by Release 201A.   Posted by TRACS on March 02, 2000 at 14:14:17: The TRACS Industry meeting will be scheduled around the NAHMA meeting held in June. The exact dates and location will be announced at a later date. It is anticipated that this meeting will have the TRACS agenda the first day. The second day will be for vendors in the morning and the CAs in the afternoon. Any recommendations for revising the second day scheduling will be welcomed. Send in suggested topics for these agendas to TRACS@hud.gov.   Posted by TRACS on February 28, 2000 at 13:32:00: Further modifications have been completed to the TRACS Release 201A Industry Specifications document and are NOW posted to the internet web. This is the February 2000 Update, modified February 28th. The website address for the document is: http://www.hud.gov/fha/mfh/trx/pdf/trxspecs.pdf Any change to an industry specification is marked in bold in the body of the document and the tables. Thanks!   Posted by TRACS on February 23, 2000 at 10:50:01: TRACS is experiencing anomolies in production that were not detected in systems test. The TRACS data submitted on 2/18/2000 is still making its way through the Tenant Batch System. The MAT data and the Voucher data submitted on 2/18/2000 has been processed. No MAT data submitted after 2/18/2000 has been submitted for processing. The data are being accumulated for submission as soon as the 2/18/2000 tenant data makes it through the Tenant Batch cycle. You will not be receiving messages from the MAT process or the Voucher process until the Tenant cycle completes. Thanks for you patience.   Posted by TRACS on February 22, 2000 at 09:36:22: TRACS Users who submitted data to TRACS on 2/18/2000 should have received two sets of MAT messages by now. The first set was the product of a production run on 2/19/2000, and all version 200A data was rejected. Due to a migration error, the MAT program that does the 200A to 201A conversion was not invoked. The production run stream was fixed on Monday, 2/21/2000 and the data were resubmitted. The rerun of the MAT cycle was completed and the messages from the rerun have been sent to the user mailboxes. The 2/18/2000 voucher submissions were successfully run through the voucher batch system. The Tenant data has not been completely processed as this message is being prepared. Do not resubmit any data that was submitted to TRACS on 2/18/2000.   Posted by TRACS on February 11, 2000 at 09:58:59:  Modifications have been completed to the TRACS Release 201A Industry Specifications document and are NOW posted to the internet web. This is the February 2000 Update. The website address for the document is: http://www.hud.gov/fha/mfh/trx/pdf/trxspecs.pdf Any change to an industry specification is marked with a vertical line in the left margin of the document. Unfortunately, however, vertical lines are not appearing next to any of the changed message codes and text in the message tables toward the end of the document. We are working on this and hope to have the update lines displayed soon. Other than the lines not being visible, the codes and messages are correct as they appear to you now. Please view the record format in Attachment E for the MAT10 Section 3: Family Record to make certain that you have programmed according to its specifications. Thanks!   Posted by TRACS on February 10, 2000 at 09:43:41: The TRACS Vendor Region was opened for testing on February 4th. We apolgize for the late confirmation of its availabilty. We encourage those using the Vendor Test facility to advise TRACS when a test has been submitted by using the email address: TRACS_SOFTWARE_TEST@hud.gov. This will help us to provide quicker turn-around. We also encourage Vendors to advise TRACS, using the vendor test mailbox. If there are any anomoties detected that appear to be in the TRACS code. In this case, please include a phone number where you can be reached. TRACS Tenant Release 201A is on schedule for the February 18 release. Just as a reminder, the 201A format will still be accepted until May 1, 2000. As a reminder, please use the TRACVnnnnn convention as the Mailbox Id for vendor test. If you use your regular TRACSnnnnn Id, the test will not be split off from the production data, and it will be submitted to production system.   Posted by TRACS on February 07, 2000 at 13:11:43: First of all, modifications have been completed to the TRACS Release 201A Industry Specifications document which is expected to be posted to the internet web at the end of the day on Februray 8th for your viewing. This will be the February 2000 Update. Any change to an industry specification is marked with a vertical line in the left margin of the document. Secondly, a question arose about the MAT10 Section3: Family Record. Some of you have noticed that the specifications written in the December 1999 Update document text (IV. B.) are different than those in the table record layout in Attachment E at the end of the document. We apologize for the inconsistency. The record format is correct in Attachment E. Please follow the specifications stated in the MAT Field, Field Names, Start Position, Field Length, and Field Type columns of the table record layout in Attachment E at the end of the document. There will be minor changes posted to the Section 3 record for the February 2000 Update but to the Definitions and Edits column only.   Posted by TRACS on January 27, 2000 at 15:14:05: Several Vendors have been eager to test using the the TRACS Vendor Region, but, unfortunately, the Vendor region is not yet available. Re-establishing the Vendor Region configuration to test 201A is in process. The integration testing of the TRACS Tenant Batch System should begin next week. As soon as the Test Team has confirmed that the Tenant Batch System will successfully run as a job stream, it will be migrated to the Vendor Region and made available to the Industry. The Industry will be notified of the Vendor Region availability, by a notice in this Forum, as soon as it is available. At the moment, February 4 appears to be a likely date. As a reminder, please use the TRACVnnnnn convention as the Mailbox Id for vendor tests. If you use your regular TRACSnnnnn Id, the test will not be split off from the production data, and it will be submitted to the production system.  [ Announcements Forum   Posted by TRACS on December 08, 1997 at 16:41:45: New TRACS Fatal Errors New fatal errors have been defined for the tenant certification system, effective December 16, 1997. TRACS will now match project and contract numbers on tenant certifications against the TRACS Contracts database to ensure that submitted project and contract numbers are valid. Certifications that cannot be matched against current contracts are rejected with fatal error messages. Listed below are descriptions of the new fatal error codes. They are part of the complete list of TRACS Fatal Error codes found in Appendix E of the TRACS MAT Users Guide.  F0103 Project number is not in TRACS Contracts. 1. Verify that correct project number was submitted on (re)certification. 2. Correct and resubmit, if wrong. 3. If correct, call your Field Office to fix in Contracts. Resubmit the (re)certification after Field Office makes correction. F0104 Contract number is not accepted for Rent Supplement, RAP, Section 236 or BMIR. 1. Verify that correct subsidy was submitted on(re)certification. 2. Resubmit the (re)certification after removing the contract number or correcting the subsidy type. F0105 Contract number is not in TRACS Contracts. 1. Verify that correct contract number was submitted on (re)certification. 2. Correct and resubmit, if wrong. 3. If correct, call your Field Office to fix in Contracts. Resubmit (re)certification after Field Office makes correction.  F0106 RAP or Rent Supplement project number not in TRACS Contracts. 1. Verify that correct project number was submitted on (re)certification. 2. Correct and resubmit, if wrong. 3. If correct, call your Field Office to fix in Contracts. Resubmit the (re)certification following correction.   Posted by TRACS on October 22, 1997 at 10:09:26: A Guide to Understanding and Solving Payments Error Messages How to Obtain a Copy of the MAT Guide You can download a copy of the MAT Guide from accessing the TRACS Internet page at http://www.hud.gov/fha/mfh/trx/html/trxsum.html. Click the link to TRACS DOCUMENTS and follow the instructions provided. If you have questions or problems, call the TRACS HOTLINE at (800) 767-7588. Formatting Resources If you need help correctly formatting a MAT record, contact the TRACS HOTLINE at (800) 767-7588. The Field Office can provide procedural help, such as how to submit a correction, deletion, etc. Your software vendor may also be able to help. Error Message Basics In most cases, the Field Office will instruct you on how to resolve the problem and either resubmit the original voucher or submit a correction to the original voucher. Which one depends on the type of message generated: VF messages are generated from TRACS; you will need to correct the problem and resubmit the original voucher. VS messages are generated from LOCCS. The voucher successfully passed through TRACS but was rejected by LOCCS. In most cases, you will need to resubmit the voucher as correction after the error condition is fixed. Alternatively, you can delete the original voucher and submit the corrected voucher as an original.  TRACS Generated Fatal Error Messages VF022 Invalid contract number. 1. Verify the contract number against your paperwork, making sure that zeros and the letter ""o"" are used where appropriate. If incorrect, correct and resubmit the original voucher. 2. If the submitted contract number is correct, contact the Field Office so they can verify the contract number in TRACS. Follow the Field Office's instructions. VF023 Invalid project number. 1. Verify the contract number against your paperwork, making sure that zeros and the letter ""o"" are used where appropriate. If incorrect, correct and resubmit. 2. If the submitted project number is correct, contact the Field Office. After Field Office staff has notified you that the project number was corrected in TRACS, resubmit the original voucher. VF024   Deferred payment amount requested is greater than the voucher balance. The deferral payment amount you requested for that voucher was greater than the voucher balance. You must recalculate your deferment request to be equal or less than the voucher balance and resubmit the voucher. VF025 -- no longer applicable Voucher submitted for AHAP, APC, or APRAC. No HAP, PAC, or PRAC in TRACS. This edit was removed from the system and should not be encountered. VF026 Deferred payment requested exceeds total voucher amount. The payment you requested exceeded the balance of the original deferment amount. TRACS only allows you to request a deferred payment equal to or lesser than the original deferment amount. Recalculate, correct amount, and resubmit the original voucher.  VF027 MAT30 correction submitted after the voucher was paid. A voucher cannot be corrected after it has been paid. You will need to submit an adjustment with the next voucher. The Field Office can provide instructions on how to submit an adjustment; refer to the MAT Guide, MAT30, Section 2, for correct format. VF028 MAT31 voucher deletion submitted after voucher was paid. A voucher cannot be deleted after it has been paid. Same as VF027 but submit the adjustment with MAT31. VF029 Claim ID submitted with invalid format. 1. Claim ID's are not required in version 1.1.8.B but are in version 2.0.0.A. If you are using 1.1.8.B, resubmit the original voucher with that field blank. 2. If you are using 2.0.0.A, you must submit a correctly formatted Special Claim ID. The Claim ID is a nine digit code: the first four is the area/state code, followed by an assigned sequence of five characters. Contact the Field Office to request   Posted by TRACS on September 29, 1997 at 13:46:18: Automated Payments Phase I functionality has now been installed in the TRACS vendor testing region. Voucher transactions (MAT 30 and MAT 31) may be submitted for testing under both version 1.1.8.B AND version 2.0.0.A. Test vouchers will be subject to the new voucher edits as outlined in Chapter 6 of the MAT User's Guide, June 1997. Only TRACS functionality is available for testing. None of the LOCCS confirmation messages will be returned. Tenant certification transactions should be submitted under version 1.1.8.B. only.   Posted by TRACS on September 19, 1997 at 17:18:31: We have received reports from owner/agents that they are being told that they have to convert to 2.0 software. THIS IS NOT A TRACS REQUIREMENT. TRACS RELEASE 1.1.8.B COMPLIANT SOFTWARE WILL WORK FOR PAYMENTS. TRACS does return some new messages for Payments in the standard message format. If the software vendors have proprietary software that filters all messages returned by TRACS, their clients should be advised that they may not be receiving all TRACS messages. TRACS does not require user software upgrades whenever a new message in the standard format is added to either the Tenant or the Voucher/Payments systems.   Posted by TRACS on September 19, 1997 at 11:54:00: We would like to reiterate that software used by Owners/Agents for Voucher Summary Transmissions (MAT30) for Release 1.1.8.B will work for Payments Phase I. No change in user software is necessary to format transmissions to TRACS for Payments Phase I. Special Claims records transmitted to TRACS using Release 1.1.8.B software may include a Claim_Id, or the Claim_Id may be blank. If a Claim_Id is submitted it must meet the format specifications for Payments. Special Claim records transmitted to TRACS using Release 2.0.0.A software must have a Claim_Id meeting the format specifications for Payments or the voucher will be rejected. TRACS now recommends that Owners/Agents DO NOT transmit vouchers to TRACS using Release 2.0.0.A software before the DECEMBER vouchers to make certain that all Special Claims have been approved by the appropriate HUD field office and returned with a Claim Id. If Special Claims with the Claim_Id are submitted for November vouchers using Release 1.1.8.B software, that's fine. However, if Special Claims are submitted without Claim_Ids using Release 2.0.0.A software, the voucher will be rejected. We feel that it would be prudent to continue using the Release 1.1.8.B software for TRACS transmission at least through the month of November.   Posted by TRACS on September 15, 1997 at 17:11:24: Invalid Project Number error messages from MAT30 submissions Since the implementation of the Automated Payments Phase I software, many MAT30's have been rejected because of project number errors. Here are some guidelines which may help avoid MAT30 rejections, or at least uncover the reasons behind them: VF023 Invalid project number. This fatal error indicates that the project number submitted on the voucher does not match the project number stored in TRACS. Contact your field office to find out which project number is correct. The field office can take steps to correct the project number in TRACS if it is wrong. IF your MAT 30 is a payment request for a Section 8 contract, you may resubmit the MAT 30 with a blank project number. The project number field is optional for Section 8 HAP requests. The field must be blank; if the field is zero-filled, the MAT30 will be rejected.  VSR22 Project/contract number is not in LOCCS. This status message indicates that LOCCS (HUD's disbursement system) has no active project/contract number which matches the one submitted on the voucher. It is possible that the project/contract is not in LOCCS at all; it is also possible that the contract is not active because it has expired. Contact the HUD office that authorizes your payment for details.  VSR024 Period covered by this voucher is invalid. This status message indicates that a voucher for this period has already been entered manually by the FAD and has either been paid or marked for payment. Assuming that a paper voucher was sent to HUD's Field Accounting Division in addition to your TRACS electronic request, there should be no further action necessary on your part. For future submissions, be certain to clearly mark ""Copy of Electronic Submission"" on the paper copies of the voucher before sending them to HUD.   Posted by TRACS on September 12, 1997 at 14:36:03: Instructions for Obtaining, Installing, and using the free PDF Reader ******************************************************************* Obtaining the Reader 1.

Click YES when it asks if you would like to continue. 3) Once the Install Shield W izard completes its task, the Welcome screen   will appear. At this point, it is advisable to close all other W indows programs running in the background. 4) Then click NEXT in the Welcome window. 5) After reading the software licensing agreement, click YES 6) Then choose the destination directory. If the default directory is acceptable, click NEXT. If not, click BROWSE and select another directory, then click NEXT. The installation program will then extract the reader program to the designated directory. 7) When the installation is complete, click FINISH in the Setup Complete window. You now have everything you need to download and view PDF files. You may click on PDF files in a Web page, save them to your PC, and then open them in the reader. * To download a PDF file, click on the link for that file.

Vouchers submitted to TRACS prior to August 29 will not be included in the October 1 payments through TRACS. They will precede the cutover to production. Software used by Owners/Agents for Voucher Summary Transmissions (MAT30) for Release 1.1.8.B will work for Payments Phase I. No change in user software is necessary to format transmissions to TRACS for Payments Phase I. Special Claims records transmitted to TRACS using Release 1.1.8.B software may include a Claim_Id, or the Claim_Id may be blank. If a Claim_Id is submitted it must meet the format specifications for Payments. Special Claim records transmitted to TRACS using Release 2.0.0.A software must have a Claim_Id meeting the format specifications for Payments or the voucher will be rejected. TRACS recommends that Owners/Agents DO NOT transmit vouchers to TRACS using Release 2.0.0.A software before the November vouchers to make certain that all Special Claims have been approved by the appropriate HUD field office and returned with a Claim Id. If Special Claims with the Claim_Id are submitted for October vouchers using Release 1.1.8.B software, that's fine. However, if Special Claims are submitted without Claim_Ids using Release 2.0.0.A software, the voucher will be rejected. We feel that it would be prudent to continue using the Release 1.1.8.B software for TRACS transmission at least through the month of September.   Posted by TRACS on August 27, 1997 at 17:06:40: There are several companies which have developed software to interface with TRACS in the electronic submission of tenant data on form HUD-50059. HUD does not endorse any individual software developer or service bureau. You may obtain a listing of software companies from the National Leased Housing Association, tel. (202)785-8888.

All requests for Rent Supplement, RAP, Section 8, PAC and PRAC payments MUST be transmitted electronically through TRACS on the MAT 30. Failure to make subsidy requests through TRACS may cause payments to be delayed significantly. Under the planned Automated Payments procedure, paper voucher submissions to the respective HUD field office or the Voucher Processing Hub in Kansas City and to the HUD Financial Accounting Division continue to be required until further notice. Although contracts administered under an ACC will NOT be paid through the TRACS Voucher Processing/Automated Payments System at this time, these voucher summaries (MAT 30s) should continue to be transmitted to TRACS for budget forecasting purposes. These transmissions will continue to be made by your Contract Administrator. We strongly encourage all owners/agents who are not currently transmitting MAT 30s to acquire the necessary software and services immediately and to begin transmitting MAT 30s well before the anticipated September 1, 1997 deadline. This will help to ensure a smooth transition to Automated Payments. For additional information regarding Automated Payments, please check this Announcements Board frequently. If you have questions, please post them to the TRACS Forum.   Posted by TRACS on May 20, 1997 at 14:16:06: PC SprintMail How to Determine Nearest Access Number ________________________________________________________________ _______ To determine the telephone number of the Sprintnet Access Center nearest to your location, call Sprint's ""Automated Access Number Delivery System.""

We have discovered that some Housing Authorities are submitting TRACS data with MTCS address information in the Sprint Header record. When transmitting data to TRACS, please ensure that the 'From:' field in the Sprint Header contains the correct TRACS Mailbox ID (i.e. TRACSnnnnn) and the 'To:' field in the Sprint Header contains TRACS.NCS(REC). At the present time, MTCS and TRACS do not communicate with one another.

Thursday's meeting will only cover Automated Payments and will begin at 10 a.m. Friday's meeting, the regular TRACS/Industry date, covers the other aspects of TRACS and also begins at 10 a.m. We will adjourn at 3 p.m. on Friday. If you have any questions, please send an email to 'TRACS@hud.gov'. Please see below for the address and agenda. Building 490, L'Enfant Plaza East, S.W. Suite 2206 Washington, D.C. 20024 AGENDA May 15, 1997 -----------Introduction Automated Payments Phase I Scope Schedule Impact Issues Lunch Automated Payments Phase II May 16, 1997 -----------Introduction Update Since February 6, 1997 Meeting Voucher Processing HUB Computer Income Matching Status of 4350.3 Change 27 Missing Voucher Issue Priority 4 Messages MAT70 Sender Defined Data TRACS SprintMail Address Automated Payments Phases I and II Lunch Industry Discussion   Posted by TRACS on April 23, 1997 at 10:26:56: We do not have an implementation date yet for Chg-27. As you may remember, last year's TRACS funding was cut from $10 million to $3.5 million. CHG-27 was one of the major pieces delayed by that funding cut. We anticipate implementing the CHG-27 relationship codes as well as income codes as part of Payments Phase 2 during calendar 1998. We hope to include even more pieces of CHG-27 as well. In the meantime, you may continue to use the old codes which follow: Relationship Code Values: ------------------------H S A C L O F N Head Spouse Adult Co-Tenant Child Live-in caretaker Other family members Foster child(ren) None of the above  Comments: -------Any age is valid for Relationship Codes 'H', 'S', or 'A'. However, a discrepancy is generated if age is < 15. The Head, Spouse, or Adult Co-Tenant with age < 18 cannot be the qualifying household member on a Move-in or Initial Certification for Section 202 PRAC, Section 811 PRAC or Section 202/162 PAC. Relationship codes 'C' and 'F' can be applied only to children < age 18. A certified household must have one and only one Head. A Head and an Adult Co-Tenant may comprise a certified household but a certified household can never have an Adult Co-Tenant without one designated Head.   Posted by TRACS on April 22, 1997 at 09:45:33: Minimum Rent Specs: The minimum TTP of $25 applies to Section 8 and Section 202/162 (re)certifications. The enforcement date for Move In and Inital Certifications is 7/01/96. The enforcement date for all (re)certifications is 10/01/96. The exemption from the minimum rent was effective 12/01/96, and the TRACS changes to enforce this were implemented on the weekend of Feb. 1, 1997. The conditions to qualify for the exemption from the minimum rent are: 1. Must be a Section 8 or Section 202/162 subsidy type, AND 2. The family must have an adjusted monthly income of $75 or less, AND 3. The certification effective date (transaction effective date on a MAT 70 with a rent change) is 12/01/96 or later, AND 4. One or more of the following conditions is true: a. Any family member has business or employment income, OR b. The Head, Spouse or Co-Head has a special status code of ""E"" or ""H"", OR c. The family receives an allowance for handicapped/disabled assistance.   Posted by TRACS on February 26, 1997 at 15:58:41: TRACS Tenant transactions contain a field for submitting the date of the Voucher on which the effect of the transaction is reported. The implementation of the optional Voucher Date was announced in early August of 1994 and began with Release 1.1.7's implementation in mid-August of that year. At the October 1996 Industry Meeting, it was announced that the currently optional Voucher Date would become mandatory 1/01/97. As there have been delays in publishing specifications for the Industry, the mandatory voucher date implementation has been deferred to 3/01/97. The transactions requiring the Voucher Date are: MAT MAT MAT MAT 10, 40, 65, 70, Certifications Move-Outs Terminations Unit Transfer/Gross Rent Change  The date entered depends upon the subsidy type. Section 8 ->Payment Month of HUD-52670 Rent Supplement ->Payment Month of HUD-52670 RAP ->Payment Month of HUD-52670 Section 202 PRAC ->Payment Month of HUD-52670 Section 811 PRAC ->Payment Month of HUD-52670 Section 202/162PAC->Payment Month of HUD-52670 Section 236 ->Transaction Effective Month & Year BMIR ->Transaction Effective Month & Year The Voucher Date, as a mandatory field, will be enforced as a MAT edit. Tenant transactions submitted on or after 03/01/97 must have the Voucher Date populated. Transactions submitted without a Voucher Date, in the MMYYYY format, will be rejected as MAT Error Code ""D"" (FIELD IS NOT A VALID DATE/TIME). This is an existing MAT error that will now include the Voucher Date. There are no changes in the MAT formats submitted to TRACS via SprintMail, nor are there format changes to the data returned via SprintMail. What will be different is the MATER (MAT Error Record) will now include the Voucher Date as a field in error.   Posted by TRACS on February 26, 1997 at 15:53:58: Effective 10/21/1996 TRACS will accept multiple certifications for the same tenant in the same TRACS processing cycle. They will have to be different transactions for the tenant. Multiple certifications for the same tenant with different effective dates will be processed. Multiple certifications for the same tenant with the same effective date will also be processed as long as the matching certifications are corrections (action processed code ""1""). Duplicate transmissions will continue to be rejected.   Posted by TRACS on January 27, 2000 at 15:14:05: Several Vendors have been eager to test using the TRACS Vendor Region, but, unfortunately, the Vendor region is not yet available. Re-establishing the Vendor Region configuration to test 201A is in process. The integration testing of the TRACS Tenant Batch System should begin next week. As soon as the Test Team has confirmed that the Tenant Batch System will successfully run as a job stream, it will be migrated to the Vendor Region and made available to the Industry. The Industry will be notified of the Vendor Region availability, by a notice in this Forum, as soon as it is available. At the moment, February 4 appears to be a likely date. As a reminder, please use the TRACVnnnnn convention as the Mailbox Id for vendor tests. If you use your regular TRACSnnnnn Id, the test will not be split off from the production data, and it will be submitted to the production system."
