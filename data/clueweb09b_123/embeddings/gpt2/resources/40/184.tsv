GX230-97-11881359	January 25, 2002 Ann Veneman, Secretary U.S. Department of Agriculture C/O Office of the Hearing Clerk Room 1081 South Building U.S. Department of Agriculture Washington, D.C. 20250 e-copy: Gino.Tosi@usda.gov  L~ c,.:: ,-J  ,-  ,': 2b  Re: Milk in the Northeast and Other Marketing Areas Docket Nos. AO 14-A69, et al.; DA-00-03; 66 Fed. Reg. 54064. Dear Secretary Veneman: As President of McCadam Cheese Company, I wish to express my opposition to the Recommended Decision of the Dairy Programs Branch, Agricultural Marketing Service, significantly reducing the manufacturing allowance for Class III milk used to produce cheese and cheese byproducts. McCadam is located in a rural, economically distressed region of upstate New York. We have approximately 200 employees and provide an important local market for about 300 dairy producers. McCadam is the oldest cheese manufacturer in North America and one of only three cheddar manufacturers remaining in New York State. We have a national and even international reputation for quality cheesemaking. All of our products are manufactured from Grade A Class III milk. We understand that USDA proposes to reduce cheese plant manufacturing margins by about 50 cents per hundredweight of farm milk at average test. That is, the Department intends to reduce the spread between regulated Class III prices and market prices for cheese and cheese by-products. In its Decision, it appears that USDA has concluded that the proposed lower manufacturing allowance rate (a) will have negligible impact on small cheese manufacturers, (b) will not impede the competitiveness of small   handlers, and (c) that in any event most cheese makers will be able to recover their costs plus a return on investment under the rule. The Decision assumes that cheese manufacturing plants operated by small businesses such as ours have the same manufacturing costs and the same opportunities to realize by-product revenue as larger, better capitalized firms. This is totally untrue. From data published by the California Dept. of Food & Agriculture, we have benchmarked our plant costs to those of larger cheese plants located in California and most assuredly do not even come close to achieving the same economies of scale. Furthermore, since our company does not have a whey dryer or butter making facilities, we realize only a fraction of the profit potential of cheese by-products. We compete in a national cheese market with plants that receive unregulated milk, with regulated cooperative plants that are not required to pay producers regulated prices, and with California cheese manufacturers who last month were granted an increase in manufacturing margins. We do not believe that we are competing on a level playing field. USDA's Decision makes the playing field even more skewed against small firms such as ours, making it only a matter of time before McCadam, with all of its history, outstanding products, valuable employment, and market opportunity for local producers, ceases to be. It is our hope that our perspective, which is by no means unique, will be carefully considered prior to the rendering of a final decision. We respectfully request that the Department reopen its' hearing to make a more comprehensive study that includes small business cheese plants.  Sincerely yours,  Brian Lee President

This affords the opportunity for exchange of genes between the cultivated   crop and its wild ancestors.  Hybrids between cultivated and wild           sunflower are frequently reported suggesting that transgenes in cultivated  sunflower could introgress into wild sunflower populations. This study      looks at gene flow from cultivated sunflowers and their genetic structure   and persistence up to 40 years in wild sunflower populations.  Persistent,  long term gene flow in sunflower can lead to high levels of crop-wild       introgression.  The selected molecular markers from the cultivated          sunflower were found in nearly all plants of the wild populations           demonstrating a high rate of introgression between cultivated and wild      sunflowers and that pure wild plants in these populations have been         replaced by plants of hybrid ancestry.  These results clearly demonstrate   the high probability that transgenes will flow into wild sunflower          populations.  However, the escape and spread of transgenes in sunflower     and other crops will largely depend on fitness consequences and linkage     relationships of individual transgenes in a wild-type genetic background    rather than overall hybrid fitness.

But if quarantine efforts ever fail to keep out the weed, scientists with USDA’s  Agricultural Research Service  are tapping into genetically diverse sunflower relatives for backup protection.     Broomrape,  Orobanche   cumana,  ranges from pink, orange-red, purple to tan depending on its environment. It’s a parasitic plant that has no chlorophyll of its own, meaning it can’t capture the sun’s energy and make its own food. Instead, it steals nourishment from sunflower roots, stunting or killing its host. Presently, it infests sunflower crops in China and countries bordering the Mediterranean and Black Seas.    As new broomrape races evolve, international researchers, in customary treadmill fashion, develop new sunflower lines with resistance genes. But ARS scientists at Fargo, N.D., and their colleagues in el  Instituto de Agricultura Sostenible CSIC , in Cordoba, Spain, have developed technology called interspecific hybridization for sunflowers to avoid such “treadmills.” Interspecific hybrids are crosses between cultivated sunflowers and their distant relatives that were until now difficult--if even possible--to cross. Some, nearly ready for release to the seed industry, are not just resistant but immune to the broomrape race F, the newest race.    Broomrape became a progressively worse problem in Spain in the early 1990's. Yields of sunflowers that were susceptible to races E and F often fell by 40 to 50 percent. Urgently, ARS and Spanish scientists conventionally derived seven new resistant sunflower germplasms by crossing between  USDA  lines and race E-resistant lines from Russia, Romania and Turkey. New conventional hybrids from these lines are being grown in Spain where they suffer yield losses of only 10 to 15 percent. And researchers are finding that some individual plants from the seven parental lines are resistant to race F.    ARS is USDA's chief research agency.   Scientific contact:  Chao C. Jan and Jerry F.

GX066-32-16503571	The Cheese Room                              The largest object in the cheese room is the Oneida cheese vat, which was shipped from Almira, New York, to Pipe Spring soon after the fort was completed in 1872. During the first seven years of the fort's occupation, the ranch manager's family would produce between 50 and        60 pounds of cheese each day, most of which would be taken to St. George, Utah, as provisions for Mormon laborers building a temple. The process of making the large wheels of cheese was fairly straightforward, if time consuming.                                                                               Between          80 and 100 gallons of milk would be poured into the vat. Once the milk          was heated to approximately 92 degrees F, a thickening agent, called rennet,          was added. When the mixture reached the consistency of a thick gelatin,          it was cut with a knife (sometimes called a cheese harp) into small chunks          called  curds.                     This mixture was then transferred to the cheese press (inset photo          above), where the milky substance, called the  whey , was pressed          out. The resulting wheel of cheese would weigh approximately 50 to 60          pounds. Each day one wheel of cheese was                   produced, approximately the size of the model shown in the photo above          on the top of the barrel to the right of the cheese press. The cheese          produced would most closely resemble a mild cheddar.                    To transport the cheese and butter to St. George, Utah, without melting          or turning rancid, the ranchers packed the butter and cheese in wooden          barrels surrounded by flour. They found that the flour had enough insulative          value to protect the products during the four-day wagon trip, even in          the high summer temperatures of the Arizona Strip.

Tommy G. Thompson today announced that Swiss Valley Farms, Co.,        Mindoro, La Crosse County, will expand and renovate its Mindoro cheese plant with     assistance from a $3 million Industrial Revenue Bond issue approved by the Department of     Commerce (COMMERCE).       ""Wisconsin leads the nation in cheese production, so it is good news whenever our     cheesemakers add capacity,"" Gov. Thompson said. ""The Swiss Valley Farms     Cooperative will expand and modernize this plant so that it can increase production of     Blue and Gorgonzola cheeses to meet demand.""       The Governor added that the project would create nine jobs and leverage $3.2 million in     additional investment.       The project includes the construction of a 24,000-sq.-ft. addition and the purchase of     new equipment. The expansion will triple the size of the existing plant, which is     currently operating at capacity. The expansion will also result in a three-fold increase     in production volume. along with associated operating improvements and efficiencies.        Swiss Valley Farms, Co. is a farmer-owned cooperative established in 1959. With more     than 1,700 owner members, the company manufactures dairy products for sale to consumers     and industrial users. Its Wisconsin operations include cheese production plants in Mindoro     and Platteville, an office in Sparta, and a receiving facility in Soldiers Grove.

The organic crop acreage in Greece is the smallest in the EU, but is increasing significantly from year to year. Presently, production of organic apples, pears and cherries is of negligible importance, but, there is interest from farmers to develop these crops. The few apple organic orchards in production are located in the prefecture of Magnisia -Thessaly, while cherries are grown in the prefecture of Pella-west Macedonia. Reportedly, pears are not yet grown organically in Greece. Grapes, olive trees and citrus are the main organic crops. Salad vegetables are also growing in suburban small fields. Prices for organically produced fruits and vegetables fluctuate at levels 25-35% higher than prices of similar non-organic products. Ministry of Agriculture officials reported that although Greece started late with organic production, (compared to other EU member states) it has the largest potential for organic agriculture, due to its geographical & topographical structure which allows for crops to be grown in isolation and away from conventional ""high chemical input"" fields. This includes islands and isolated land pockets at varying altitudes, from sea level up to almost 5,000 ft. Under the 3rd EU Development Support Plan, organic agriculture will be a priority, among other environment friendly activities in agriculture (""diversified models for agricultural development"").

GX261-60-2750945	Grain Area Expected To Decline China is a relatively land-poor country but has 40 percent more arable land than is reported. Urban sprawl and infrastructure projects will take more land out of production than can be reclaimed. But increased intensity of land use will compensate for this loss so total sown area remains unchanged. Area sown to grains will decrease as farmers switch to more profitable crops such as fruits and vegetables.  According to official statistics, arable land area in China totals 95.3 million hectares, with 88 million hectares devoted to grain production in 1995 (USDA definition). While China's land area on a per capita basis is higher than its neighbors' (3.3 times more than Japan; 2.5 times more than South Korea; and 2.8 times more than Taiwan), compared with the United States, China is relatively land poor (fig. 18). Limited arable land and a large rural labor force mean that China will tend to have a comparative advantage in the production of labor-intensive (land-saving) crops such as fruits and vegetables and a disadvantage in the production of land-extensive crops such as grains and oilseeds. There is controversy about the amount of arable land that actually exists in China today. A report published in 1992 notes that the actual amount of arable land more than 10 years ago was 44 percent greater than the 97 million hectares of arable land officially reported by China's State Statistical Bureau (SSB) (40 and 49) in that year (fig. 19). The 1997 census of agriculture in China will provide a basis for more reliable arable land estimates. China surely is losing arable land each year to urban development, road and rail construction, factory sites, dams, docks, bridges, and airfields. At the same time, new farmland is being reclaimed (49). China's arable land in southern latitudes could be used more intensively year round. The ratio of sown area to cultivated area is currently 1.56, much higher than in Japan (1.03) and in Korea (1.14), and could be pushed higher to 1.6 by 2005. From 1960 to the mid-1990's, the economies of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan grew very rapidly. Industrial growth boomed, infrastructural projects were constructed and agricultural economies were transformed. Rural laborers shifted from raising grain crops to raising other crops and livestock. These workers also  found employment in both rural and urban industries. On the basis of comparative advantage, these countries revamped their cropping patterns, decreased area sown to grain, and increased area sown to other crops-- horticultural crops, flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Despite industrialization and the encroachment of factories, roads, railroad, docks, and airfields on agricultural land, the quantity of arable land declined only slightly (fig. 20). As noted above, China is better endowed with arable land than its East Asian neighbors. Nonetheless, China likely will follow the central trend of its neighbors. Industrialization in the coming decades will not decrease China's stock of arable land very much. But total area sown to grains will fall because losses of arable land are expected to outpace reclamation. Some marginal land sown to grain crops will be returned to pasture and forest which will improve China's environmental land use balance. Farmers will switch some grain area to more profitable crops such as fruits and vegetables. Area sown to grain is expected to decrease from 87.4 million hectares in 1995 to 86.7 million hectares in 2005 (fig. 21). Farmers are projected to reduce area sown to rice crops from 31 million hectares in 1995 to 28 million hectares in 2005. Wheat area is projected to remain roughly constant at about 29 million hectares through 2005. Demand for coarse grains (corn, sorghum, millet, barley, and oats) for feed use is expected to rise. Prices likely will rise, which will encourage farmers to expand from 28 million hectares in 1995 to 29 million in 2005, an annual increase rate of 0.2 percent. In 1994, the area sown to corn accounted for 80 percent of total coarse grain area. Corn area is projected to increase at 0.6 percent a year, faster than area for other coarse grains.  10 y The Future of China's Grain Market / AIB-730  Economic Research Service/USDA   Fi gur e 18  Fi gur e 19  Persons per hectare of cultivated land While China's land area on a per capita basis is higher than its neighbors; compared with the United States, China is relatively land poor.

With judicious investment in seed research, chemical fertilizer production, and water resources, grain yields can be increased.  While ERS does not provide an alternative set of grain area numbers to SSB data, it takes into account the implication of underreporting on the future growth potential of China's grain yields. Underreporting of arable land in China has led to inflated estimates of grain yields and the appearance that China's yields are high by world standards. SSB statisticians have admitted that they have overstated grain yields to compensate for the underreported land area.1 They rely on sample survey cuttings to determine actual yields, and then inflate them 20 to 30 percent. Because of such underreporting, China's grain yields have ample room to increase above current levels (fig. 22). Higher yielding seeds, additional inputs (such as fertilizer and irrigation), and better pest management can help yields continue to rise. Science and Technology Government investment in agricultural research as a percent of total government expenditures dipped in the 1980's and early 1990's. In the ninth 5-year plan (1996-2000), however, government authorities have pledged to increase investment. 1China's statistical officials focus most of their energy on estimating grain production. They know that cultivated area is underreported and adjust yields to more closely approximate actual grain production. Sample survey statistical workers adjust sample survey yields by using a verification coefficient (12).  Higher Yielding Seeds China's leaders soon will be faced with three choices about higher yielding seeds: 1) increase investment to build up domestic seed-breeding capacity; 2) increase imports of high-yielding grain seeds; and 3) create a business environment in which domestic/foreign seed companies will invest in seed development. Hybrid corn and rice varieties currently account for about 80 and 50 percent of China's total corn and rice crop area, respectively. We assume that China's leaders will respond to seed development requirements and choose one or a combination of these options. Fertilizer Use Grain yields can be increased through fertilizer use in three ways. First, there is room to increase the quantity of fertilizers applied (fig. 23). Fertilizer usage remains low in many interior provinces. China's ninth 5-year plan calls for investment to expand and upgrade chemical fertilizer plants and the output target for 2000 is 28.4 million tons (nutrient weight basis)--up 16 percent. Second, a less volatile form of nitrogen, like urea, can be used. Thirty percent of fertilizer applied in China now is ammonium bicarbonate, a volatile form of nitrogen, in which much of the nitrogen escapes into the atmosphere before it becomes available to crops. Third, yields can be raised by applying a better mix of chemical fertilizers (N,P,K). On a nutrient weight basis, nitrogen (N) accounted for close to 75 percent of China's fertilizer production in 1994. Phosphorus (P) output has risen sharply in the last decade, but in 1994 it still accounted for only 23 percent of total output. Only small quantities of potassium (K) are produced (400,000 tons nutrient weight basis in 1994). In 1995, compound fertilizer imports surged dramatically, reaching a record 19.9 million tons (of which 4 million tons were potassium fertilizers--product weight basis). China plans to expand the production and use of phosphorus and potassium in compound fertilizers (fig. 24).  Verification coefficient =  Verified area Farmer reported area  Cultivated land area data are controlled by local government authorities who have financial interest in land taxes and grain procurement quotas and not statistical officials. These tax and financial issues have put a strain on relations between central and local governments (local areas are better off financially if they pay less land taxes and show lower grain area so they won't have to sell more grain at low fixed quota prices). Authorities likely will not revise cultivated area data until the financial and tax issues are resolved (12 and 49).  12 y The Future of China's Grain Market / AIB-730  Economic Research Service/USDA   Water Resources While central and south China have adequate water supplies, western and northern China have serious water deficits. The problem of water shortages in north China has been known for decades. Farmers expanded irrigated area in the North China Plain in the 1970's by drilling shallow tube wells and using pumps to provide irrigation water when summer rains failed to deliver the necessary moisture. Rainfall provides most of the moisture required for crops and farmers irrigate when rainfall is not timely. This added quantity of water and chemical fertilizer, however, enabled farmers to greatly boost grain yields in the 1970's and 1980's. We have assumed in our projection that water supplies in the North China Plain will hold out for the period under study--1996-2005. Evidence of a falling water table in the North China Plain may spur government leaders to look for creative solutions. These could range from using concrete ditch liners for water conservation to charging water user fees as incentives for more efficient use of water resources. China has also considered diverting water from the Yangzi River to the North China Plain--a very large and expensive civil engineering project. A separate but related problem--water quality--could be addressed by constructing sewage treatment facilities in rural and urban areas.

Economic Research Ser vice/USDA  The Future of China's Grain Market / AIB-730  y 13   China's Grain Yields and Production Will Rise Wheat, rice, and corn yields are projected to rise in the coming decade. These yield increases will compensate for the decrease in area sown to grain crops so that total grain output is projected to increase 1 percent a year.  Based on projected investments in seed development, increased and better balanced fertilizer use, improved pest control programs, and more efficient use of irrigation water, grain yields are projected to rise at an annual average growth rate of 1.3 percent over the next 10 years (fig. 25). ERS projects total grain production in China to increase 1 percent a year, from 346 million tons in 1995 to 382 million tons by 2005 (fig. 26). China is currently the world's biggest grain producer, accounting for 20 percent of the global total. China's wheat yields are relatively high by world standards because a significant amount of wheat area can be irrigated if water shortages develop. These yields are projected to annually increase by 0.7 percent to 2005. Rapid economic growth rates, rising incomes and changes in consumer preferences for quality wheat products, a projected population growth of 100 million people, and a projected increase of 150 million people in urban areas (from about 350 million in 1995 to 500 million in 2005 for the coming decade) will boost domestic demand for grain above supply (fig. 28). China's domestic wheat output is projected to rise about 1 percent a year (99 million tons in 1996 to 108 million tons in 2005). Rice yields in coastal provinces are already comparatively high by world standards but yields in interior provinces have substantial potential to increase. Use of high-yielding varieties will slow as farmers plant higher quality (but lower yielding) rice varieties. Overall, rice yields are projected to increase slowly over the next decade at an annual average rate of 0.7 percent. Because of the drop in area sown to rice, rice production is projected to decrease slightly from 127 million tons (milled) in 1996 to 126 million in 2005. China likely will follow the general pattern of rice consumption as her East Asian neighbors--as incomes rise per capita rice consumption will hold steady or decrease (fig. 27). Coarse grain yields other than corn are projected to increase modestly in the coming decade. But there is considerable room for seed breeders to develop highyielding corn varieties for specific localities and for  farmers to boost yields by applying better balanced chemical fertilizers (fig. 22). Corn yields are projected to rise by 1.7 percent per year (from 4.76 tons per hectare in 1996 to 5.55 tons in 2005). With projected increases in area sown to corn and yield increases, corn output is projected to rise on an average annual rate of 2.3 percent (from 108 million tons in 1996 to 133 million tons in 2005). Assumptions Underlying USDA Projections  Growth in grain yields depends on investment decisions and policy measures and commitment by the government. Low investment in agricultural research could lead to a slowdown in grain yield growth rates.  The quantity of arable land at present is not certain. This will hopefully be resolved in the next few years after the 1997 census.  Government intervention in grain markets and the fixing of procurement prices has an effect on grain production. These policies have been in flux, but we assume that current policies would continue, and that market forces would become increasingly important in decision making in the grain economy.  A primary assumption made by USDA was that China's government would continue to control the imports of feed grains and meats. If this constraint is relaxed, grain and meat imports could be larger.  USDA has been aware of the water shortages in the North China Plain for many decades. But for the period 1996 to 2005, we assume that water would be sufficient to allow for increases in grain output in that region of the country.  USDA also assumes a stable political situation in China.  14 y The Future of China's Grain Market / AIB-730  Economic Research Service/USDA   Figu r e 2 5  F igur e 26  China's grain yield projections China's gr ain yields to gr ow.

Infrastructural Constraints to Grain Imports  Rapid economic growth since 1980 has put an enormous burden on China's ports and transportation systems (fig. 29). Over the coming decade, China will expand its overworked rail system and build a road system to link farms, factories, consumers, and ports. China has a large number of excellent seaports but much work will be required to expand the number and capacity of berths and improve efficiency of port operations (30) (fig. 30). The World Bank estimates that China should invest $300 billion in the coming decades to upgrade its transportation infrastructure. The World Bank currently has a $490-million project to improve the grainhandling systems, elevators, and pneumatic loading, which will greatly aid China's grain imports. One should note that China's seaport cargo throughput more than tripled from 217 million tons in 1980 to 744 million tons in 1994 and by 2000 the target capacity will be 1 billion tons. Domestically, most grains are transported via highways and railroads (fig. 31). We assume that from 1995 to 2005 China's port, rail, and road infrastructure will improve to handle the additional forecasted 16.5 million tons of grain imports. Building new grain-handling facilities at China's ports will cost several billion dollars. Steady Grain Importer  per capita consumption and decreasing grain output (5). If per capita livestock product increases, then he projects China will import 369 million tons by 2030. There are mitigating factors that rule out such a large increase.  Long-term projections need to take into account the self-correcting mechanisms in market economies. Grain shortages would lead to rising prices, stimulating production and reducing consumption, in China as in the rest of the world.  China still can expand grain production. Because local authorities underreported cropland areas by an estimated 40 percent in the past, China's yield statistics have been overstated. The actual yields leave much room for future improvement through better management, higher yielding seeds, and greater use of inputs.  Although China's meat demand will rise in the future, its growth will slow since it is already at a high level for a country at China's level of development. Per capita annual meat consumption (40 kg) is roughly on par with that of Korea (37 kg) and Japan (44 kg).  Even supposing that China meets the requirements to become a member of the World Trade Organization, China's policymakers probably will restrain meat consumption, on the grounds of promoting domestic self-sufficiency and by claiming that meat is a luxury good (as in Korea and Japan). Such a policy would permit imports of feed grains but restrict imports of meats. This would keep meat prices inside China high and consumption relatively low.  Limited grain handling capacity in China's ports will constrain the quantity of grain China can effectively import. Likewise limited container handling facilities and cold storage space will constrain the amount of chilled/frozen meat that can be imported.  By most calculations, China will neither import huge volumes of grain nor return to being a large net exporter of grains as it was in 1992-93. Instead, it will gradually become a more significant importer of grains by 2005 and probably beyond. This forecast arises from the likelihood that demand for feed grains will accelerate faster than production increases, and that China's government policies will accommodate these changes. ERS projections are in line with forecasts made by a number of other institutions with the exception of one (fig. 1).

GX265-39-10087172	"PRESS RELEASE August 18, 2003  100 Deere Cotton Pickers Transit To Turkmenistan The country of Turkmenistan received a hefty boost to its agricultural sector recently, with the delivery of 100 new John Deere mechanical Cotton Pickers. Manufactured at the John Deere Des Moines Works in Ankeny, Iowa, the 4-row harvesters traveled in two stagings by rail to the Port of Baltimore and via ship to Bremerhaven, Germany. Cotton ranks as Turkmenistan's third leading export, and in a country with only 3.47% of its land arable, this upgrade is expected to significantly increase their farmers' productivity. An initiative by Norfolk Southern Railway Co. to accommodate these `High and Wide' machines made their participation in the transit to Baltimore possible. Upon arrival at Dundalk Marine Terminal, the Cotton Pickers were quickly unloaded and placed upon specially diverted Wallenius-Wilhemsen ships bound across the Atlantic. As the closest inland port to the Midwest, Baltimore's location and skilled work force enabled the shipment to meet its strict timetable. ""The U.S. transit for the first 50 Cotton Pickers could not have been better,"" noted John Deere Port Inspector Craig Peterson. ""We had absolutely no room for delays and we stayed ahead of schedule throughout. It was better than expected and showed teamwork at its best."" ###"

The first step in natural dyeing is to gather the plant material. Materials such as flowers and roots may be gathered and dried for prolonged storage. Some natural plant dyes are available commercially at weaving or health and nutrition stores.   2.  Before dyeing, fabrics must be treated with a mordant to set the dye. Instructions for making and using mordants follow. Natural dyeing as practiced on the frontier was not an exact science. Some experimentation may be neces-sary to achieve desired results.   3.  To make a dye-prepare the plant material by cleaning and chopping roots, scraping stems and crushing leaves of flowers and nuts. Soak the prepared materials overnight. After soaking, boil until the dye has reached the desired shade (l/2 to 6 hours).   4.  Natural dyes will not hold their color unless the fabric is first treated with a mordant. A mordant for wool or silk is made by dissolving 1 ounce of alum in 1 gallon of water and adding l/4 ounce of cream of tartar. For cotton or linen, add l/4 ounce of baking soda instead of cream of tartar.   5.  Soak the material to be dyed in the mordant for about an hour. Rinse thoroughly before dyeing.   6.  Dyeing-after dye has reached the proper shade, strain it into a kettle filled with 4 gallons of hot water and a little salt and vinegar. Mix thoroughly. The dye solution should be darker than the desired final color.   7.  Immerse the fabric in the dye and simmer for 15 to 30 minutes. Turn the material with a wooden stick or spoon while dyeing. 8. Rinse the dyed material in cold water and hang to dry in a shady place.     Note: If you are collecting bloodroot or larkspur, take precautions not to deplete the plant population in any area. If plants are rare, either do not use or use only a few to experience the colors.    Be sure to ask permission from private landowners before collecting or digging plants. Many public areas have regulations about plant collection, so check with site managers before gathering. Digging plants is prohibited on roadsides and public lands in Missouri.  Be careful when collecting and handling plants that may be poisonous. Bloodroot and larkspur may cause dermatitis. Parts of bloodroot, larkspur, pokeberry and elderberry can be poisonous if eaten.         -Next Page-        MDC Homepage   Missouri State Homepage   Tell a Friend   Search   Contact Us   Privacy Policy   Help              Use of this site is subject to certain  Terms & Conditions.

DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:    The Director of Pesticide Regulation proposes to register the products listed above  pursuant to Chapter 2 of Division 7 (beginning with Section 12751 of the Food and  Agriculture Code) on or after June 15, 1999 .  Comments concerning this proposed  action may be directed to the Department of Pesticide Regulation until that date.    As a result of scientific evaluation, it has been determined that no direct or indirect  significant adverse environmental impact is anticipated from the registration of the  above listed products; therefore, no public report on the individual products will be  filed.      Notice of Proposed Decisions to Register (Continued)  Page  7      ALTERNATIVES:    An effective integrated pest management strategy requires the flexibility of a large  number of comparable, but not exactly equivalent, pesticides.  A detailed alternatives  analysis involving all anticipated crop and pest uses, under many environmental  conditions and cultural practices, is beyond the scope of the normal evaluation process,  when no significant adverse environmental impact which cannot be mitigated is anticipated.  Such analyses are more appropriate where more specific conditions apply, such as at  the user level or, in the case of restricted materials, at the level of the county  agricultural commissioner.  For a specified situation there may be few or no alternatives.    In the present case, in the absence of an identified significant potential adverse  impact, the benefit arising from pest management flexibility is determined to justify  this registration.                 _______________________     Dated     Original Signed by Barry Cortez      ________________________________     Barry Cortez, Chief     Pesticide Registration Branch         NOTICE OF FINAL DECISIONS TO REGISTER PESTICIDE PRODUCTS      The Director of the Department of Pesticide Regulation, pursuant to Section 6253 (Title 3) of the California Code of Regulations, files this Notice concerning pesticide products with the Secretary of the Resources Agency for posting.

Sunflowers—today known for their tasty, crunchy seeds and a healthful            salad oil—might tomorrow gain fame as a source of premium rubber.            That's the plan of scientists who have joined forces to improve the            quality and quantity of latex from sunflower plants.                     Latex is made up of rubber particles surrounded by water and other            plant compounds. It is a higher value product than solid rubber. As            rubber factories of the future, lanky sunflowers would reduce America's            dependence on imported natural rubber and on synthetic rubber made from            petroleum. The United States imported about 1.2 million tons of natural            rubber—worth about $1 billion—in 2000. Although synthetic            rubber can be substituted in some instances for natural rubber, high-performance            products such as airplane tires require natural rubber.                     ""More than 2,500 species of plants produce natural latex,""            says  ARS  plant physiologist Katrina            Cornish at Albany, California. ""But few of them have the traits            we want. In particular, most are small, grow too slowly, or aren't suitable            for being cultivated in uniform stands—or monocultures. And they            don't produce enough latex, or the latex they produce is not high quality.                     ""In contrast, sunflowers grow large rapidly and do well in monocultures.            Although the quantity and quality of latex from sunflowers is not yet            good enough for commercial use, we expect to improve it further through            genetic engineering,"" Cornish adds. She is part of the ARS Crop            Improvement and Utilization Research Unit of the Western Regional Research            Center in Albany.                     Cornish and colleagues are experimenting with several different types            or lines of sunflowers. ""We are especially interested in lines            that produce the highest amounts of latex in stems and leaves—as            opposed to flower heads,"" Cornish points out. ""That's because            it's impractical to separate latex in the flower head from oil and other            components. We're also focusing on lines that flourish in northern,            temperate climates, where most of the U.S. sunflower crop is grown.""                     At Albany, Cornish is delineating the physical characteristics of sunflower            candidates' latex and comparing them to those of latex taken from two            other natural sources—the Brazilian rubber tree and a desert shrub,            guayule. (See  Agricultural Research ,  May            1999  and  April            2002 .)                     Cornish will insert laboratory-built genes for latex production into            sunflower tissue. Next, she will test the tissue to determine whether            the new genes are working inside the sunflower's cells. Later, greenhouse            and field tests will identify the gene-engineered plants that produce            the highest amounts of the best quality latex. In experiments after            harvest, Cornish and co-researchers will determine how to preserve sunflower            latex while it's in storage, awaiting processing.                     Cornish is a world authority on how plants produce rubber.

In their continuing endeavor, these researchers and their international colleagues currently focus mainly on three major diseases: Sclerotinia stalk rot and head rot and downy mildew.   ""To develop new sunflower breeding lines with disease resistance, we rely heavily on genetic resources from wild sunflowers that evolved in their native North America,"" says ARS plant pathologist Thomas J. Gulya, of the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota.   The North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station—a joint venture among ARS, 12 agricultural experiment stations, and Iowa State University, in Ames—now provides a reservoir of 1,600 cultivated sunflower accessions (specimens) and more than 2,200 accessions of the 49 wild sunflower species from which scientists may draw for breeding experiments or research purposes.               Scientists like Gulya are typically unsung heroes. As diseases are controlled, the low incidence of epidemics tends to go unnoticed. For example, some 15 years ago, a single registered fungicide was so effective in controlling downy mildew that commercial plant breeders did not include mildew resistance among their top breeding priorities. During the past 2 years, however, ARS scientists at Fargo have found new fungicide-resistant strains of downy mildew. Anticipating resistance and continued evolution of other mildew races, Gulya and coworkers located new sources of mildew resistance and transferred the genes into agronomically acceptable germplasm. Now, new sunflower hybrids with USDA-bred resistance, combined with fungicides, may avert calamities.   The fungus  Sclerotinia  causes sunflower diseases that account for half of the disease-related yield losses in the Northern Great Plains. In some years these losses total $15 million. Sclerotinia stalk rot, the most significant sunflower disease in the United States, appears year in, year out, regardless of weather.   With neither chemical-control nor genetic-resistance weapons, the U.S. grower is nearly defenseless. ARS scientists have been searching for tolerance to the disease, both in cultivated breeding lines and in wild sunflowers, for the past two decades. Recent germplasm releases by the ARS team have given the sunflower industry its first sources of tolerance to Sclerotinia stalk rot.   Sclerotinia head rot occurs during wetter-than-normal growing seasons—like September 1999. More than 75 percent of the sunflower acreage in North Dakota had head rot, which not only caused substantial yield losses, but also contaminated the soil for many years. Whenever soil is highly contaminated with sclerotia, growers must rotate to a crop like wheat, which is prone to scab, instead of to other  Sclerotinia -susceptible broadleaf crops, such as soybeans, dry beans, or canola. ARS scientists had already been working with researchers in Argentina and France to find sources of resistance to head rot, but after the 1999 epidemic, head rot research became a much higher priority.—By  Ben Hardin,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

So a couple of years ago, when sunflower farmers began seeing mysterious brown spots on the blunt end of their seeds,  Agricultural Research Service  scientists answered a call for help.Were the spots caused by a disease? An insect? Or both?     An answer and a solution to the problem remain crucial because farmers who produce sunflower seeds for the confection market end up selling the seeds for birdseed at low prices if more than 0.5 percent have the condition called kernel brown spot. Last year, the spots were found in 7 percent of seed samples from some fields.     ""At first, we considered the type of fungus called  Alternaria  as a prime suspect,"" says ARS plant pathologist Thomas J. Gulya, of the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota.     But Gulya and ARS entomologist Laurence D. Charlet exonerated the fungus and are now pointing at the lygus bug, also known as the tarnished plant bug. It's an insect whose notoriety has been associated largely with cotton, but hundreds of crops serve as hosts. In the Northern Great Plains, the quarter-inch-long lygus bugs thrive on increasing acreages of canola. Other tasty crops in the region include sugarbeets, safflower, buckwheat, and crambe.     Scientists at North Dakota State University are working with the ARS scientists to compare lygus bug populations in sunflower fields planted next to certain other crops. ""So far, we've observed that sunflower, being a late-seeded or late-maturing crop, serves as a host plant for second-generation lygus bugs,"" says Charlet.     Though lygus bugs don't eat much—probably not enough to reduce sunflower crop yields—they have the nasty habit of injecting plant tissues, such as the developing seeds, with digestive enzymes and extracting nutrients with their pointy little mouthparts. The microscopic injuries thwart development of surrounding tissue and appear as big brown spots after the seed matures and is marketed and hulled.     In greenhouse studies, the scientists found kernel brown spot only in seeds from flowers they had covered with bags containing lygus bugs. In USDA insecticide trials at four sites, researchers found less severe kernel brown spot where the plants had been sprayed well before harvest time with insecticides used to control the banded sunflower moth and the seed weevil. The same insecticides kill lygus bugs. To start learning what steps to take and when best to take them to minimize kernel brown spot, the scientists set up several types of experiments last summer.     The confectionery sunflower market has grown rapidly in recent years to sales in multimillions of dollars involving China alone. U.S. exports of the edible seeds to China grew from 300 metric tons in 1995 to 10,000 tons in 1999.—By  Ben Hardin , formerly with ARS.

Charlet,  Agricultural Research Service  Fargo, ND  58105              OBJECTIVES          Reduce crop losses by developing management strategies for sunflower insect pests, including banded sunflower moth and the sunflower stem weevil using parasitoids and microbial agents, and other biologically-based methods such as cultural control and host-plant resistance. Develop increased knowledge on biology, ecology and insect-host interactions, including potential for biological and cultural control of red sunflower seed weevil, sunflower beetle, and sunflower midge in partnership with State and ARS cooperators.          APPROACH          Collections of sunflower stem weevils, red sunflower seed weevils, banded sunflower moths, soil samples, and sunflower plants will be examined for pathogens. Pathogen isolates will be identified and bioassayed using feral or reared insects. Wild and cultivated sunflower will be evaluated for resistance to banded sunflower moth. Components in sunflower pollen, seeds, or other plant parts determined to convey resistance will be identified and synthesized. Banded sunflower moth and sunflower stem weevil larvae will be collected from cultivated and native sunflower species to locate new parasitoids and their biology, abundance, and impact determined. The interaction of insects and disease on sunflower production will be determined through trials conducted in NE, CO, and KS.  The potential use of different planting dates as a control tactic to reduce damage from sunflower beetle will be evaluated and the impact on parasitism monitored. The life history, emergence, flight, and oviposition of sunflower midge will be studied and host-plant resistance of hybrids and inbred lines measured.

Wild and interspecific germplasm will be evaluated for oil quality, disease resistance, and insect resistance. Develop an RFLP genetic map of sunflower, develop and characterize primary trisomics, and to integrate agronomically important genes onto the RFLP map. Investigate if LOX pathway metabolites function in sunflower defense against pests.          APPROACH          Additional populations of several wild sunflower species from various geographic regions of N. America will be collected. All germplasm accessions will be deposited in the  Helianthus  collection at the Regional Plt Introduction Stn, Ames, IA. Population accessions of wild species will be evaluated for oil concentration and for fatty acid composition. Wild sunflower species will be evaluated for disease tolerance to the major sunflower diseases and insects. Interspecific hybridization will be conducted by crossing domestic  H. annuus  with various accessions of wild species. Embryo culture techniques will be used to obtain difficult cross combinations. Specific useful genes will be transferred into cultivated sunflower. Species and genomic relationships will be evaluated cytologically. Resulting amphiploids from chromosome doubling will be evaluated on their ability to increase backcross seed set as well as their function as bridges to convert wild species and cultivated lines. Genes of agronomic interest will be mapped onto the sunflower RFLP map.  Fargo, ND, NCSL, Rm.237, 248:BL-1  07/19/2000.

""By the year 2001, U.S. acreage of oilseed sunflowers could  well double from its present 2.2 million,"" predicts Larry Kleingartner,  executive director of the National Sunflower Association (NSA).    Oils derived from the new hybrids have just the right composition to  make fried foods taste better and stay fresh longer than foods prepared in  oils from traditional sunflower hybrids,  Agricultural Research Service  scientists have found.    The new hybrids, collectively called NuSun, produce oil that's  several times higher in oleic acid than traditional sunflower oil. And it holds up  longer in frying vats--even without being hydrogenated.    NuSun oil's bright promise is recognized by a mid-oleic task force  organized by the NSA, which has been promoting commercialization. The task force  includes researchers, growers, and people in the seed, vegetable oil processing,  and food industries. NuSun hybrids are being grown on some 100,000 acres this  year.    In the United States, oilseed sunflowers are grown mostly in the  Northern and Central Great Plains. The crop produces about 440,000 tons of  vegetable oil, about 70 percent of which is exported.    ARS geneticist Jerry F. Miller and biochemist Brady A. Vick at  Fargo, North Dakota, found that a single, dominant gene ensures any number of  sunflower hybrids can be easily bred to produce oil that's in the mid-oleic range  60 to 75 percent oleic acid. In 2 years of tests, this range remained stable in  different  growing environments from North Dakota to Kansas.    Oleic acid is termed a monounsaturated fatty acid. Some studies have  indicated that a high proportion of fat as oleic acid in moderately  low-fat diets can lower serum cholesterol and the risk of coronary heart  disease.    Another nutritional asset, a rich vitamin E content already in  traditional sunflower hybrids, remains just as abundant in NuSun hybrids, according  to ARS tests in 1997.    So far, Miller and Vick have found that, through conventional  breeding, NuSun hybrids can be developed to produce oil with nearly 30 percent  less saturated fatty acids than traditional hybrids. Potato chips fried in  such oil could be labeled as ""Low in Saturated Fat,"" having less than  1 gram of saturated fat per 28.4-gram (1-ounce) serving.    To reduce saturated fat even further, the Fargo scientists have  produced some plants with mutations for low levels of palmitic acid and others  with low stearic acid levels. By crossing both of these mutant types with  established breeding lines, they have produced oil with a palmitic-stearic range of  6 to 9 percent, in contrast to 11 to 12 percent in traditional hybrids.    ""NuSun could become an exciting new venture in the oilseed  sunflower industry,"" says Curt Stern, field operations manager for the  sunflower division of Archer Daniels Midland Company at Enderlin, North Dakota.    ""If the entire U.S. snack food industry switches to NuSun oil,  it will need roughly 4 billion pounds a year--about 4 million acres of  cropland. And because mid-oleic oil requires no hydrogenation and is low in saturated  fats, fast foods and salad oils may also become large markets,"" says  Stern.    High-oleic sunflower oil has been a specialty oil since 1988.  However, the food industry mainly uses less expensive oils, like cottonseed and  partially hydrogenated soybean oil.      There's Lots To Recommend Them    Many seed companies have developed NuSun hybrids using genetic  resources released by ARS. These hybrids may provide a reliable supply of  mid-oleic NuSun oil to food industries, says Miller.     ""In field tests, we've shown that commercial NuSun and our  experimental hybrids are as good as traditional sunflowers in economic qualities  such as yield potential.""            By switching hybrids, farmers may see steadily increasing demand for  their crop at home and abroad. And if NuSun is successful, NSA's Kleingartner  says, each segment of the market chain should benefit. Among the big winners:  Health- and cost-conscious consumers and vegetable oil processors.     The costly processing step of bubbling hydrogen into polyunsaturated  oils--partial hydrogenation--won't be required to protect against  flavor deterioration. No hydrogenation means no formation of trans fatty acids  that some nutritionists claim may be unhealthful. Not common in plants,  trans fatty acids are geometrically altered forms of once polyunsaturated fatty  acids, like linoleic and linolenic, that had multiple places for hydrogen atoms to  bond, or saturate.    A commercial NuSun hybrid making its debut this year produces oil  that's about 65 percent oleic acid. The 69 percent linoleic acid content of  traditional sunflower oil was reduced to 26 percent, which means the new oil  doesn't have to be hydrogenated.    Linoleic acid is a key to giving fried foods their flavor. But even  with less linoleic acid, there's still enough for desired flavor in fried  foods, according to sensory panel evaluations at the ARS National Center     for Agricultural Utilization Research (NCAUR), Peoria, Illinois.     ""Tortilla chips fried in NuSun oil have a high intensity of  fried-food flavor,"" says NCAUR food technologist Kathleen Warner. With aging,  the NuSun chips stay fresh-tasting longer than chips fried in commercial  sunflower oil.    Snack food companies could benefit as consumers become repeat buyers  of flavor-stable chips, Warner says. The companies could benefit further  by not needing to replace used NuSun oils as frequently as they might more polyunsaturated frying oils. However, no simple test yet exists to  precisely compare the fry life of vegetable oils or to know when one should be  changed.     Many different compounds are formed when vegetable oils are heated,  explains Warner. Research at NCAUR on measuring these compounds is a step toward  learning their effects on flavor and could eventually lead to benchmarks for  determining when to replace oil in a deep fryer.    Moreover, at frying temperatures, NuSun oil produces lower  intensities of off-odors. Sunflower oil, until now, has often been blended with  cottonseed oil to ensure a pleasing fried-food aroma.--By   Ben  Hardin,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.    Jerry F.

But just in case this exotic weed should defy quarantine efforts and enter the country, researchers are searching for sources of resistance that could provide protection.   Broomrape,  Orobanche cumana,  is a parasitic plant with no capacity for making chlorophyll on its own. So it steals nourishment from sunflower roots, stunting or killing the plants. It now infests sunflower crops in China and countries bordering the Mediterranean and Black Seas.   International researchers try to develop new sunflower lines with resistance genes to keep up with the evolution of new broomrape races. But  ARS  scientists working with colleagues at the Instituto de Agricultura Sostenible in Córdoba, Spain, have taken that defense a step further. They have found a way to use interspecific hybridization—that is, crosses between cultivated sunflowers and distant relatives that were difficult to impossible to make, until now. Some of these improbable crosses have proved to be not just resistant—but immune—to broomrape race F, the newest one.   This work was spurred by losses of 40 to 50 percent of Spanish sunflower crops to broomrape races E and F in the early 1990s. Research collaboration has led to seven new, resistant sunflower germplasms derived by crossing USDA lines with race E-resistant ones from Russia, Romania, and Turkey. New conventional hybrids from those lines now growing in Spain are suffering only 10- to 15-percent yield losses.    Chao C. Jan  and  Jerry F.

Blackeye Peas Go Green    Plant breeders recently released the first-ever blackeye-type southern pea that shows the green cotyledon seed trait. Peas of the new variety retain their fresh green color, even when harvested dry. Green Dixie Blackeye was released for use by both home gardeners and the dry-pack bean industry. The peas can be harvested fresh for immediate consumption or storage in home freezers, as well as fully dry—for storage or sale as an attractive dry pack.   Green Dixie Blackeye is the result of 10 years of cross-breeding of the large, cream-type Bettergreen variety with the popular and high-yielding Bettergro Blackeye. It produces dry pods in around 70 days, each holding about 14 peas that are larger than those of Bettergro Blackeye. And it outyielded the top-producing Arkansas Blackeye #1.   Dry peas can be restored to fresh-harvest seed size and color by soaking in water for 2 hours and blanching in boiling water for 3 minutes. Seed of Green Dixie Blackeye has been offered to over 240 commercial seed growers and food-processing companies, so an adequate seed supply should be available by 2002.    Richard L.

Fish farmers routinely apply a chemical called copper sulfate to catfish-rearing ponds to curb excessive growth of oxygen-hungry algae. Less algal growth means healthier fish and lower production costs. Now researchers are wondering if the compound might also cut down on waterborne fungi that destroy catfish eggs before they can hatch into small fry.   Since the 1980s, fish farmers have had only one officially approved therapeutic drug—formalin—available to protect their eggs. Copper sulfate would be a less costly alternative that's also easier to apply and less smelly. Cooperative research with Phelps Dodge Refining Corp., El Paso, Texas, will attempt to find out if copper sulfate can protect channel catfish eggs without harming young hatchlings. Approval is already being sought for its use in treating a parasitic disease of fish called ichthyopthiriasis.    Billy R. Griffin,  USDA-ARS  Harry K.

Rice Is Nice—for Doughnut-making   Modified rice starch, rice flour, and other rice-based ingredients, when incorporated into doughnut dough, reduce the absorption of frying oil by up to 70 percent. Mixed with wheat flour, the rice ingredients make a dough that is more tender, consistent, and moist, and they reduce oil uptake. Though less oily, the doughnuts made from the experimental formulations compare favorably in taste, texture, and other sensory properties with traditional cake doughnuts.   Researchers have tried many different combinations of wheat and rice ingredients, searching for the best ratio for reducing oil absorption without sacrificing consumer appeal. Tests of the finished doughnuts showed all-wheat doughnuts to have 24 to 26 grams of oil, while some wheat-rice ones had as little as 8 grams.

FOREWORD  1. Following the Tokyo Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan in January 2002, a multi-donor mission, led by the Asian Development Bank, visited Afghanistan for one week during February 2002 to initiate a needs assessment for the natural resources and agriculture sector. This mission provided the foundation for, and recommended, a more detailed analysis of needs by the current mission,1 which visited Afghanistan from 7 April to 7 May 2002. 2. The terms of reference of this mission focused on two requirements, namely (i) the preparation of project profiles for quick impact interventions, so-called QUIPS, and (ii) a medium term strategy, policy and institutional development framework for the natural resource and agriculture sector to set the stage for sustainable development into the medium term. For this purpose, the natural resources and agriculture sector is broadly defined to include all aspects of natural resource management, utilisation and protection. 3. The mission consulted extensively, with the concerned line ministries namely, the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development (MRRD), the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources (MIWR), and the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (MAAH). In addition a close working relationship was maintained with the Afghan Assistance Coordination Agency (AACA) who maintain an overview of the sector. Discussions took place with all major international agencies and donors, and with key NGOs working in the sector. Field visits were undertaken to Bamiyan province, the Panchir valley and the Shamali plains adjacent to Kabul. In addition, the mission participated in a Water Resources Management and Development Conference sponsored by MIWR and UNICEF, which was held in Kabul between 29 April and 1 May. 4. The mission is extremely grateful for the time accorded to its activities by the staff of all the various ministries and agencies working in the sector, and whose views have helped to shape this report. The aim is that this draft report will provide a basis to achieve a consensus on a medium term vision for the sector, together with the policies, programs and institutional changes needed to realise that vision. Once agreement is reached, the sector framework will provide a basis to ensure individual projects are supporting priority activities and outcomes.  1  The mission was led by the Asian Development Bank and comprised Allan Kelly (ADB, Project Economist/ Mission Leader), Ray Shaw (ADB consultant, Agriculture Economist), Richard Smith (ADB consultant, Rural Development Specialist), Elayne Gallagher (ADB consultant, Institutions Specialist), Ted Breckner (ADB consultant, Agriculturalist), Aziz Bouzaher (World Bank, Natural Resource Specialist), Tony Garvey (World Bank, Water Resources Specialist), Rodney Kennard (FAO consultant, Livestock Specialist), Abdul Salkini, (ICARDA, Agricultural Research) and Roma Bhattacharjea (UNDP, Gender Specialist ).  2   Draft Report II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  5. The overall objective in the natural resources and agriculture sector is to improve livelihoods for all sections of the rural community based upon economically competitive activities, social cohesion and sustainable use of natural resources. Specifically, the planned outcome is self-reliant communities who are able to meet their needs through a combination of food production, off-farm employment and trade. 6. This needs assessment for the medium term development of the natural resources and agricultural sector is based on sub-sector programs or investments, institutional reforms and capacity building, and policy reform. The recovery process requires a coordinated response on each of these aspects for the medium term development outcomes to be achieved. The assumptions underlying this development are one of a market led economy, with Government pursuing prudent financial and fiscal polices and a liberal trade regime. Additionally, the recovery process is premised upon continued political stability, and a return to normal climatic conditions. 7. The vision for the sector reflects the principles outlined in the Tokyo speech of Afghanistan Interim Authority (AIA) Chairman Karzai, January 2002 and the National Development Framework (NDF), April 2002. It has the following key elements: (i) (ii) (iii) A ""bottom-up"" community based approach to the determination of development priorities, using the micro-watershed as the planning unit; A natural resources management and regulatory mechanism, which ensures that the use of natural resources by communities, in aggregate, does not exceed the capacity of natural systems to sustain themselves. The critical natural resource is ""water"" whose availability must be maximized and whose use must be effective and efficient. In doing so, ecosystems will be sustained while agricultural output is maximized. It is essential that all communities and agencies become aware that the abstraction of water incurs a cost over and above the delivery of the water; The transfer of modern dryland farming technologies to rainfed areas with a view to producing at least half the country's cereal needs from rainfed farming; Rehabilitation of small, medium and large irrigation systems managed by their communities/beneficiaries and growing predominantly high value cash crops capable of supporting the cost of the infrastructure; A traditional integrated livestock economy based on sustainable rangeland management and crop by-products, plus commercial peri-urban livestock enterprises serving the main urban communities; Private sector led provision of agriculture services including seed, fertilizer, farm machinery, agro-chemicals and animal health products; Agricultural marketing in the hands of the private sector, but with a significant farmer based marketing organisation segment; A thriving off-farm income generating sub-sector primarily targeted at and organised/operated by women; A lean, reformed set of sector institutions performing an agreed set of public sector functions An appropriate policy framework conducive to a thriving private sector.  (iv) (v) (vi) (vii) (viii) (ix) (x) (xi)  8. Rebuilding the natural resources and agricultural economy upon which up to 85 percent of the population depend for their livelihood will require a fundamental change in the manner in which development priorities are determined and implemented. Its calls for a development agenda, which is driven by community-determined priorities, and should be based upon appropriate participatory mechanisms to ensure that all stakeholders are 3   Draft Report represented. Logically, this should produce a dual approach to community based interventions which include both productivity enhancing interventions for those with land (and employment opportunities for the landless) and targeted off-farm interventions for the landless or families with small amounts of land. Both types of intervention will be required and are complementary. 9. Further, this community based approach to setting the development agenda must be fitted within a natural resource planning framework which ensures that the use of natural resources remains sustainable, that key resources are protected and shared efficiently, that proven solutions for sustainable resource use are made available sector- wide and that the approaches to export market penetration are coordinated. 10. This sector vision is translated into a set of sub-sector development programs, with the needs divided into two timeframes, a short-term program to be completed within two years and a medium term program of up to five years. Developing the sub-sector framework and programs, the need for institutional change and policy reform to support the new development strategy is assessed, and required interventions incorporated in the programs. These sub-sector programs build upon ongoing activities, and envisage a gradual decline in the current high levels of food dependency. Within five years the sector should be largely self-reliant, with most communities relying upon a combination of food production, off-farm employment and trade to meet their needs. A. Natural Resources Management  11. Traditional natural resource management, coping and mitigation strategies have broken down under growing population pressures, the collapse of the rural economy and control by elites. These strategies must be rebuilt within the context of the community development approach and sustainable natural resource management. In the future, vulnerability to drought must be significantly reduced by incorporating a range of technologies and by strengthening off-farm income generating activities. Any tendency for misuse of natural resources must be countered by appropriate environmental management institutions backed by legislation. Currently, Afghanistan does not have an agency with overall responsibility for the protection of its natural resources. 12. It is proposed that the above issues be addressed within the context of a natural resource management approach based upon river basin (watershed) planning and their subdivisions (micro-watersheds) as indicated in the NDF. At the micro-watershed level, management plans would be formulated with full community participation and the communities, through the allocation of tenure or user rights, would become the custodians of the micro-watershed's natural resources. The permitted level of natural resource use in each micro-watershed would be determined in collaboration with the agencies responsible for overall natural resource management. B. Water Resources Management  13. Water resources are the country's most precious resource. They must be managed efficiently and sustainably in order to maximize agricultural output. Water resources are fundamentally scarce and drought is a common occurrence. Although Afghanistan has limited water resources, it does not make effective use of what is available. The Government needs to develop a longer-term strategy to manage water resources and reduce vulnerability to drought. The strategy should focus on increasing the water capital and making better use of water. Specifically, the strategy should include (i) water harvesting and watershed management, including more water storage structures both small and large, (ii) effective control of groundwater use, (iii) better information systems on water availability, (iv) eliminating unsustainable land use practices (v) improved intake structures and 4   Draft Report corresponding on-farm water management, (vi) the management transfer of state owned schemes, plus, (vii) extending the irrigated command area. C. Community Development Program  14. The vast majority of rural communities lack basic services, especially communications, clean drinking water, and health facilities. While agriculture is the basis of the economy little advice on new technologies and varieties is available, and institutional credit facilities are absent. Community infrastructure related to agricultural production, such as irrigation systems and water impoundments, bridges and roads are badly degraded. Community participation in decision-making for economic development has been relatively narrowly focused. The opportunity exits for strong village consensus reckoning through the Shuras and other reliable mechanisms to help vulnerable groups. The community based approach to development has traditional foundations but as a result of recent depredations, will require, (i) strong support programs to assist empowered communities to develop the skills to play a full part in the decision making processes which are being offered to them and (ii) funding to enable the outcomes of these processes to be supported and have practical results. D. Agriculture (Crops)  15. Productivity levels of rainfed and irrigated farming are low even by regional standards. There is considerable potential for productivity improvements. ICARDA has designed and promoted drought tolerant varieties and cultural practices for cereals, legumes and forage crops that would significantly increase returns and could double current yields. With extensive implementation of well-designed micro-watershed management techniques including the adoption of micro water harvesting techniques the potential to treble current yields is possible. 16. A key feature of existing irrigation systems is their very low efficiency rating of about 25 percent, which indicates that there is considerable scope for reducing the wastage of water, and increasing the irrigated area. Reliable data on the current extent and productivity of irrigated agriculture is fragmented, largely due to the combined impact of recent conflicts and the prolonged drought. Many systems have been damaged or suffer from lack of maintenance, with a number of the more modern systems and larger traditional systems also having salinity and waterlogging problems. The productivity of all types of systems can be improved substantially. Particular attention should be paid to intake design, and to the transfer of irrigation system management to beneficiaries. E. Livestock  17. Livestock enterprises are beset with serious problems including loss of livestock, decreased productivity due to declining feed and overgrazing, and the affects of animal diseases, which are not being adequately treated. Much of the irrigated land, which formerly supported livestock, is now without water. The small poultry flocks, which were almost exclusively owned and managed by women have for many households almost disappeared, while the smallest and poorest farmers who formerly kept at least one cow to provide for their subsistence needs are now without animals. Disease problems are only being partially contained. Rangeland is overgrazed and nomadic and semi sedentary sheepherders are operating with high mortality rates. Improvements in the small ruminant sector, even in nondrought times, is hampered by traditional user rights and grazing practices and a preoccupation by raisers with livestock numbers rather than productivity. 18. The interest in livestock keeping will be influenced by the development of an institutional and regulatory framework, adequate livestock support and animal disease 5   Draft Report services to improve livestock. Policies on rangeland management and use to be prepared for nomadic livestock herders. F. Agriculture Research and Technology Transfer (ARATTS)  19. It is a fundamental requirement that a review be undertaken to assess the needs, policies, functions and institutional structure to establish and operate an efficient ARATTS that will respond to farmer identified priorities and to future farming needs. The principles underlying the future shape of ARATTS should include; (i) (ii) (iii) Integrating onfarm participatory research and technology transfer activities into practical development programs; Development of demand-driven, community-based research and technology transfer programs that recognize the special needs of rural poor, especially the disabled, children, and rural women; Adoption of innovative methodological approaches, such as the farming systems approach to research and development, integrated natural resource research sites, integrated watershed management, incorporating socioeconomic aspects with technical and biophysical research programs; and Determining the most effective institutional framework for linking research with extension delivery agencies and organisations.  (iv)  20. A restructured ARATTS network has a key role to play in bringing appropriate technologies to Afghanistan and in leading the adoption of productivity enhancing methods by farmers. G. Off-Farm Employment  21. Off-farm income generation activities are an integral part of rural production systems. It is generally accepted that families with less than 0.5 ha of irrigated land have great difficulty earning a living solely from agricultural production in most parts of Afghanistan. This means that about 65 percent of farming families rely upon off-farm income generating activities to achieve a modest living. 22. For small-scale rural enterprises to flourish will require a supporting package of services, which should include the provision of raw materials, training and market outlets. It is proposed that the most feasible solution to meeting these needs would be the rural cooperative with an apex-marketing arm in the main urban centres. In the short to medium term such development could be supported by an NGO with experience in this area. This initiative would have a strong gender and poverty alleviation impact. H. Institutional Development  23. The AIA has clearly stated its vision for the public sector. The line ministries and other state entities will be responsible for overall natural resource planning, policies and related management parameters, the formulation of programs to deliver agreed public services to the community level, including technology transfer, the regulation of private sector activities and the monitoring of performance of development programs. Implementation, to the extent possible, will be entrusted to the private sector, including NGOs and beneficiary communities. In this regard, Government will create the enabling environment for the operation of national and international firms (in particular for engineering and construction). 24. Local communities will be empowered to decide their development priorities, to contribute to implementation of their projects and activities where possible, and to monitor 6   Draft Report the work of government agencies and the private sector. Government's strategy will focus in the near-term on creating employment and supporting livelihoods at the community level. 25. These principles indicate the need for a complete review of the current institutional structure governing the natural resources and agriculture sectors at all levels, from the national to the village level. The existing structure is a legacy of several highly centralised administrations whose views were diametrically opposed to the decentralised approach of the present administration. In the short to medium term, the line ministries will undergo a process of change management to move from their current all encompassing functions to one, which reflects the vision of a set of core functions for public sector agencies. 26. Currently there is a relatively limited number of highly skilled professionals available in Afghanistan. As the number and scale of the development programs and projects is expanded, these existing resources will be fully utilised, and a strategy needs to be developed to address the anticipated shortfall. Key aspects will involve technical and management areas to meet the rapidly increasing demand, establishing capacities to provide training, re-establish training institutions, and encourage the return of skilled Afghan professionals. The latter have the potential to provide an excellent resource in modern management, economic and technical approaches. Planned technical assistance, which requires foreign inputs should focus on maximising to the extent possible the employment of Afghan professionals. 27. The need for training and retraining courses is vast. There is a clear requirement for a structure to the delivery of training needs at the different levels and in the various subject areas. Some of the key considerations to bear in mind in formulating a training needs assessment are: (i) There is a considerable body of technical expertise already available but much of it needs to be brought up to date and reoriented to the community participatory approach envisioned by the AIA. Therefore, there will be a large demand for retraining programs especially of technical staff such as engineers. The Government has expressed its intention of reforming and downsizing the line ministries. The implication is that large numbers of government agency staff will be seeking work in the private sector. Training programs will need to be provided to prepare them for private sector roles. The type of retraining programs could form part of a relocation package. There are NGO and private sector organisations specializing in this field that need to be identified as potential partners.  (ii)  (iii)  28. While improving capacity, and developing strategies to meet requirements in the short to medium term, it is essential that specific strategies are prepared to support and improve the role of women in both government institutions, and in the rural communities and village economy. At the village level, there is a need to develop a comprehensive program, including training, to support the role of women in the community and community organisations, and a range of income generating skills using local raw materials to the extent possible. I. Policy and Planning  29. The development framework details the need for a number of key policy reviews and for preparatory work on a policy reform agenda during the coming two years. The legislative and regulatory aspects of the policy reform agenda will be undertaken in the medium term. A medium term time frame is required as currently institutional and enforcement capacity is minimal and will need to be established before an effective regulatory framework can be 7   Draft Report developed. Specific sub-sectors where the policy framework needs review or amendment include but are not confined to: forestry, water resources; environmental protection; rural energy; rangeland grazing; rural cooperatives; agricultural trade; public and animal health; technology transfer; rural credit and community development. 30. The policy requirements in the short to medium term will be significant for an efficient sector framework to be developed, which will enable improved livelihoods and sustainable resource management. To ensure the development of policies, legislation and regulations which are harmonized across the sub-sector a dedicated natural resources policy unit to undertake this work is required. 31. At the national level a gender strategy and action plan is required and will be developed. This strategy will address key issues relating to: the structural and systemic causes of women's poverty in the agricultural sector such as unequal access to land, credit, equipment, education, decision-making; issues of women's poverty and under/unemployment in the rural sectors; and an equal opportunity policy that will ensure recruitment of higher number of women in the future. Gender policy expertise will be required in the areas of agriculture and natural resource management to ensure gender is integrated into community development strategies. J. Implementation Strategies  32. The draft framework is the outcome of a wide-ranging consultation with all key stakeholders and it should be treated as the start of a process. It has been revised following initial comments, and the intention is that it be further discussed with the new Transitional Government in late June 2002, and that the government take the lead on reaching a consensus on the framework. The consensus will involve both internal and external aspects. The internal aspect is critically important as agreements and support is required on the priorities and framework from sector ministries. The external aspect will involve the government, AACA, taking the lead and reaching consensus with the donor community on the framework so sector interventions will be coordinated and support identified priorities. Afghanistan is receiving unprecedented attention and offers of assistance from the 33. international community. To ensure that resources are used efficiently and effectively, it is essential that efficient aid coordination and management mechanisms be established. The mission noted that various coordination mechanisms are in place, but is concerned that, at least in the natural resources sector, the coordination to date is not being led by the Afghan authorities, especially the AACA. To ensure Government ownership, and that activities are supporting government priorities, and to minimize the risk of duplication within the major donor programs it is essential to have a process established with regular donor meetings chaired by the government, and its representative body. It is envisaged that such meetings should be held and decisions taken within an agreed development framework, such as the one proposed in this report.  8   Draft Report III. A. INTRODUCTION  Approach to Needs Assessment  34. The preparation of the needs assessment involved a two stage approach, with technical specialists undertaking sub-sector assessments, and the assessment findings and recommendations integrated into an overall natural resources and agriculture sector needs assessment and medium term development framework. The reports discuss the needs assessment in two timeframes, a short-term period of two years and a longer period of three to five years. 35. The needs assessment is presented in the following manner: (i) A main report, which outlines sector strategies and needs, and presents in summary the sub-sector report findings, and highlights the programming aspects. The sub-sector key issues, objectives short (1-2 years) and medium term (3-5 years) needs, and required policy agenda are outlined in a subsector matrix table. Separate sections cover institutional and capacity building needs, the policy agenda and implementation strategies. The short-term interventions identified to address priority needs, and to provide the basis for the medium term development are aggregated and detailed in Appendix 1, Short-Term Activities. A set of Appendices, which detail the sub-sector and institutional assessment. Each Appendix describes the current situation, key issues, short and medium term needs, strategic objectives, and policy requirements.  (ii)  B.  Sector Background  36. The natural resources sector (including agriculture) has suffered from varying degrees of depredation for almost 25 years. A combination of war, civil conflict, exploitation and enforced neglect have combined to leave a legacy of degraded natural resources, especially forests and rangeland, damaged infrastructure and fragmented rural institutions. While NGOS and UN agencies have worked effectively with rural communities throughout this period and have had positive impacts at the local level, overall the sector remains poorly performing, with the country highly dependent upon food aid. The recent severe drought worsened the degradation, but it is not the key underlying factor for the non sustainable resource use, poor management and production systems. 37. The task of recovery is to improve the performance of the sector, and at the same time to rebuild its resilience through the adoption of technologies, which reduce vulnerability to drought. Although population pressures are increasing, Afghanistan has the capacity to mobilize over 7.5 million ha. of cultivated land of which 60 percent would be irrigated and 20 percent would be double cropped. This degree of land and water use amounts to about 0.35 ha per capita, a relatively generous ratio in a regional context. In addition, the country has about 29 million ha of rangeland for use by livestock. If productivity levels can be restored to levels similar to the rest of the region, then Afghanistan should be able to resolve medium to longer-term food security concerns. 38. The recovery process outlined in this report has a 5-year timeframe. In this period the emphasis will be on achieving a large measure of self- sufficiency, especially in cereal production. This is a household priority given the legacy of the past 25 years, which has left so many families unable to feed themselves. So while self-sufficiency is a household and social priority, economically it may not be the preferred option as the high degree of dependency on domestically grown cereals, is based on most cereal production using high cost irrigation systems. A longer-term development framework may involve most cereals 9   Draft Report being imported with Afghan agricultural production systems focused upon a range of cash crop exports. Achieving this potential will be dependent on the outcomes from the medium term development framework. C. Sector Development Framework  39. The development framework for the sector reflects the principles laid down in two key documents, the Tokyo speech of Chairman Karzai and the National Development Framework (NDF). The principles are as follows: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) 1. the development agenda must be in the ownership of the people of Afghanistan and implemented within a common strategic framework; the private sector should be the principal instrument of economic growth within an appropriate enabling policy framework; the participation of all sections of the rural population in decision making should be promoted through a community based approach; investment in human capital and maximum use of Afghan expertise is essential to the recovery process; donor-funded investment decisions must sit firmly within the sector framework and related budgetary norms. Determinants of a Strategic Approach  40. A number of factors, both conventional and those specific to current circumstances are relevant to the formulation of a medium term sector development framework. The conventional factors include: (i) the demand for the sectors products, both domestic and external; (ii) the spatial distribution and quality of resource endowments; (iii) population distribution and the unit size of population groups; and (iv) the accessibility of population units to markets and sources of raw materials. These are the factors, which, largely, determine the geographical allocation and use of both natural and human resources, and the need for differentiated development responses depending upon the precise combination of factors in a particular location. 41. In Afghanistan, the more specific factors include: (i) the impact of returning refugees; food security following three years of drought; (iii) poppy substitution; and (iv) mined areas. Each of these specific factors calls for additional efforts in particular locations during the short to medium term. 42. The result of combining all these factors is a complex and diverse geographical pattern of development needs, which will require a combination of donor support, private investment, the transfer of appropriate technologies, reshaped institutions, enhanced human resources and the best efforts of the Afghan people. 2. The Strategic Approach  43. In 1978, Afghanistan with a population of 14 million was self-sufficient in cereals and had a flourishing export market in horticultural products. The current population is estimated at about 20 million with a rural population of around 16.5 million. Internationally in the past 20 or so years agricultural technologies have advanced substantially enabling agricultural systems to more than keep pace with population increases. On this basis and assuming a stable and secure political environment, it would be realistic to expect a return to the former 1978 status in the not too distant future. The process of recovery has started but requires further elaboration to ensure that all concerned are contributing constructively to this common goal. Recovery of the rural sector will depend upon balancing sustainable natural resource use with population pressures. 10   Draft Report 44. As the economy remains overwhelmingly rural and agricultural with 80-85 percent of the population dependent upon natural resources for their livelihood, the pace of recovery in the rural sector will largely determine the overall rate of economic recovery. 45. The structure of rural society is one of numerous settlements (over 30,000 clustered into about 18,000 communities) many of which have very limited or costly access to external assistance and markets. Although there are marked geographical differences in wealth generating capacities across the country, there is a similar cross-section to village society irrespective of location or agro-ecological zone. This cross-section covers, landholders, small landholders, sharecroppers, landless and female-headed households. This geographic dispersal and disparities in asset distribution within rural communities require a development agenda, which is driven by community-determined priorities. Further, formulation of the agenda should be based upon appropriate participatory mechanisms to ensure that all stakeholders are represented. Logically, this should produce a dual approach to community based interventions which include both productivity enhancing interventions for those with land and employment opportunities for the landless and targeted off-farm interventions for the landless or families with small amounts of land. Both types of interventions are likely to be required, and are complementary. An agro-ecological or specific farming systems approach may be appropriate and will be adopted in specific programs. 46. This community based approach to setting the development agenda must be fitted within a natural resource planning framework to ensure that natural resource use is sustainable, that key resources are protected and shared efficiently, that proven solutions for sustainable resource use are available sector- wide and that the approaches to export market penetration are coordinated. Mechanism(s) to merge the ""bottom-up"" community approach with the ""top down"" resource management approach will need to be carefully prepared, as both perspectives are essential to sustained growth of the rural economy. 47. Three years of drought have severely tested the resilience of the respective rural communities in all of the agro-ecological zones. Further, it is evident that some communities have coped much better than others. The medium term framework will address the particular concerns of communities within each agro- ecological zone but give special attention to rebuilding the asset base of those communities which, have proved to be less resilient and where a more appropriate balance between natural resource capacity and population pressure is needed. Technology packages, including the transfer of international best practices, should be applied as appropriate to agro-forestry, rangeland, livestock, rainfed arable and irrigated arable farming systems. 48. Within any community the critical resource is ""water"" as it is the basis for most agricultural productions and for household consumption. Afghanistan, for the most part, has a low precipitation regime, which is collected mostly in the form of winter snow and spring rain. Snowmelt, particularly, in the spring and early summer is the lifeblood of rural livelihoods. Consequently, the conservation and efficient use of water must be the foundation of a fully productive agricultural sector. In most of Afghanistan water available for agriculture is likely to continue to be subject to considerable annual variation affecting both rainfed and irrigated agriculture. Within the medium term, a strategy, which mitigates the impact of these variations, should be developed. This means capturing the maximum amount of available water (increasing water capital) and making the most efficient use of it. By adopting such practices it is estimated that the productivity of agriculture (both rainfed and irrigated) could be at least doubled, thereby removing major concerns relating to overall food security. However, for the landless and small landholders it will be essential to complement improved farm productivity with programs aimed at off-farm income generation. Such efforts should be particularly targeted at rural women and female led households.  11   Draft Report 49. The majority of women in Afghanistan work in agriculture. They constitute a large portion of the agricultural labour force; estimates indicate that they account for over 70 percent of the labour. Also, women work as professionals, researchers and technical staff in the Ministry of Agriculture, Rehabilitation and Rural Development and Irrigation and Water Systems. These different groups of women constitute a key stakeholder in any strategy development, planning and project interventions in the agricultural and natural resource management sectors. Household Food security is an identified priority. The absence of food security in recent years has had a particularly adverse impact on women, as the patriarchal system implies that women in poor households are lowest in the hierarchy of intra-family food consumption, and as UNICEF sources report it has resulted in a serious incidence of women's malnutrition and a very high maternal mortality rate. 50. The success of the outlined sector development framework will require an implementation strategy, which synthesizes the strengths of the private sector, nongovernment organisations (NGOs) and line ministries at the national and provincial levels. The absence of coherent government over many years has led to the involuntary withdrawal of line ministries and their provincial offices from their traditional roles. In many provinces and in specific areas, these functions have been performed by NGOs and UN agencies. In the medium term, it will be necessary to reform the overall institutional structure of the sector. It will involve defining the new core roles of line ministries, and their relationship to the collective NGO and private sector communities. The scopes of line ministry functions, and the mechanisms to forge a closer working relationship with NGOs, especially at the provincial and district levels, are critical elements of the strategy. 51. An enormous amount of technical expertise has been lost to the sector over the past 20 years. This loss of human capital must be replaced as quickly as possible if the sector is to recover its former vibrancy, reduce dependency on external expertise and enable citizens to fulfil their potential. Thus, a key element of the medium term strategy must be incentive schemes including training opportunities designed to produce quality sector managers, program managers, technical staff and well-informed farmers. 52. Before agricultural activity can commence in many areas, it will be necessary to undertake surveys to determine the presence of mines, unexploded ordinance and bomb craters. Land rehabilitation programs will be needed in selected areas determined by the survey. 53. Poppy cultivation has increased and while concentrated in two provinces, production is spread across several provinces. Strategies to be implemented in these areas must focus on improving livelihoods through: improved agricultural productivity; alternate activities and high value cropping enterprises; and in supporting development of off farm employment opportunities. As there will be a lead-time while those alternative rural activities are established, in the short term rural livelihood interventions to improve incomes will be important. The strategies adopted will be fully consistent with those endorsed by government and the UN Drug Control Program. 3. Objectives  54. The overall objective in the natural resources and agriculture sector is to improve livelihoods for all sections of the rural community based upon economically competitive activities, social cohesion and sustainable use of natural resources. Specifically, the planned outcome is self-reliant communities who are able to meet their needs through a combination of food production, off-farm employment and trade. A realistic medium term target would be a return to 1978 levels of sector productivity and output within five years.  12   Draft Report 55. A cross-sector objective, encompassing all sub-sectors is the need to support gender-based activities, which are incorporated into the sub- sector programs. A national gender strategic and action plan is required to address key issues relating to women's poverty, decision making roles, under-employment and equal opportunity policy. In terms of the sub-sectors, specific interventions include (i) technical skills improvement (ii) training in small business enterprises, provision of training in marketing skills (iii) provision of microfinance and credit and the required training to manage money (iv) introduction of mechanized practices and processes that would lower women's burden and improve efficiency and productivity (v) promoting export of products such as dried fruits, (apricots), raisins, nuts (vi) feasibility of operating an apex marketing outlet in Kabul selling products of women in Afghanistan-social labelling, and (vii) linking with international Fair Trade partnerships 56. Specific sub-sector objectives are detailed in each of the sub-sector development matrices.  13   Draft Report IV. NEEDS ASSESSMENT: SUB-SECTOR PROGRAMS  57. The following sub-sector categories have been identified as the core of the natural resource and agriculture sector recovery effort. Each category covers a short description of the sub-sector issues and future program needs in both the short and medium term. Where relevant, reference is made to any complementary institutional and policy issues which are discussed in more detail later in the text. A. Natural Resources Management 1. Current Status and Issues  58. Afghanistan has a total land area of about 65 million ha. of which approximately 80 percent is either mountainous or desert, with forest cover small at around 1.3 million ha. or about 2 percent of the land area. Forest area has declined from 1.9 million ha. in 1996. There is one national park and five protected areas. In recent years forest cover has diminished, due to community demands for fuelwood and illegal logging. It is estimated that offtake rates are exceeding annual growth rates leaving a deficit of about 30,000 ha of forest per year. If nothing is done, Afghanistan will have very little natural forest or its associated wildlife left in 15 years time. On purely conservation and environmental grounds Afghanistan should have at least 5 percent of its land area, or about 3.2 million ha. of forest cover. This would reduce rangeland and watershed degradation, loss of biodiversity, and loss of livelihood sources. 59. Illegal logging is largely a function of the current security situation and control of local resources by local commanders in collaboration with Pakistani traders. Forestry legislation has been in draft form for years, awaiting clarification of tenure and land use rights of local tribes in many parts of the country, and especially along the border with Pakistan. The lack of a legal framework clarifying tenure, user rights, and oversight responsibilities, combined with the collapse of government institutions, has led to resource rents being controlled by local elites. Local communities, with the help of NGOs have attempted to protect forests, but local leaders have disrupted these efforts leading to the disintegration of both social organisations and physical barriers such as fencing. 60. The demand for fuelwood by communities is estimated to be less damaging than illegal logging, but is nevertheless destructive. The issue needs to be addressed within a policy framework for rural energy needs, which, incorporates provisions for community or social forestry programs. Similarly, recent years have witnessed the cultivation of rangeland as communities seek ways to mitigate the effects of drought and population pressure in some areas. These activities have resulted in the widespread degradation of both forests and rangeland, flooding, water scarcity, and in many areas severe soil degradation. 61. Government agencies have had a limited role in conservation work over the last 20 years, with most of the work being undertaken by NGOs. The NGOs have worked directly with local communities and shuras, with the focus of activities being livelihood sustenance based on horticulture and agroforestry interventions. While the NGO contribution has been large, there has been little coordination of the program and limited any evaluation. This experience and the lessons learned will need to be integrated into the planning for proposed activities as will mechanisms to link the AIA vision for reformed government agencies working with NGOs as partners, or using them as contracted agents. 62. There is a general consensus that the natural resources of Afghanistan are in poor shape. The extended drought is commonly cited as the principal cause together with the period of conflict. Whilst the conflict has undoubtedly been an exogenous factor, the impact of drought should not be seen as an event, which necessarily results in a degraded 14   Draft Report environment. Afghanistan has a history of drought of varying severity and will continue to experience such periods. Traditional coping and mitigation strategies have broken down under growing population pressures, the collapse of the rural economy and control by local elites. These strategies must be rebuilt within the context of the community development approach and effective natural resource management. In the future, vulnerability to drought must be significantly reduced by incorporating a range of technologies and by strengthening off-farm income generating activities. Any tendency to misuse natural resources must be countered by appropriate environmental management institutions backed by legislation. Currently, Afghanistan does not have an agency with overall responsibility for the protection of its natural resources. 63. The issues outlined above provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, lead to the identification of short and medium term needs, and policy requirements for a subsector development framework which is summarized in Table 1. The framework is discussed in detail in Appendix 2. 2. Development Framework a. Short-Term Interventions  64. It is proposed that the above issues be addressed within the context of a natural resource management approach based upon river basin (watershed) planning and their subdivisions (micro-watersheds) as indicated in the NDF. At the micro-watershed level, management plans would be formulated with full community participation and the communities, through the allocation of tenure or user rights, would become the custodians of the micro-watersheds natural resources. The permitted level of natural resource use in each micro-watershed would be determined in collaboration with the agencies responsible for overall natural resource management (i.e. the river basin authorities and their parent organization). Pilot programs to test micro-watershed planning, building upon similar work supported by NGOs, should commence within the next six months. It is envisaged that this work will take place within the broader context of community empowerment and participatory planning programs. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) 65. Pilot social forestry projects should be established in those areas worst affected by community fuelwood gathering. These activities could be initiated quickly under the Rural Livelihood (short-term employment generation) Program, and more widely as a component of the Community Development Program. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) 66. Urban greening projects could be initiated, quickly under the Rural Livelihood (shortterm employment generation) Program. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) 67. Forest and Rangeland Assessment Inventory. The status of the remaining forest area and of rangeland to be assessed using GIS technology. The possibility of concluding agreements with local commanders to help curb illegal logging to be assessed. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) b. Medium Term Programs/Investments  68. The Government should commit itself to a target of 5 percent forest cover within 20 years. This target should be allocated by watershed and be made the responsibility of the proposed river basin authorities. A similar target should be set for the rehabilitation of degraded rangeland, above a minimum altitude. 69. In the medium term, forest policy and forest legislation, implementation of institutional reforms and social forestry activities as part of the community development programs will be 15   Draft Report the major focus. Policy and legislation will be required for community joint management of forest resource, commercial logging, plantation, biodiversity and developing community forestries. The social forestry activities will involve community management of forest resources. Classification and codification of all forms of tenure rights will be needed to effectively implement these activities. 70. The implementation of a participatory natural resource management strategy in line with AIA policy will require institutional change at the village/district, provincial and national levels. At the village/district level the representative committees will need to develop planning and management skills in addition to their traditional conflict resolution role. At the provincial level, line ministry staff will have to combine technical competence with those of participatory planning and at the national level there will be major reform and reorganization. The institutional and policy issues are covered in more detail in Section V and Section VI respectively in this report.  16   Draft Report  Table 1: Natural Resource Management Matrix Key Issues Severe depletion of natural forest and biodiversity resources Conversion of pasture land to crop land Timber demand rapidly increasing Urban greening Demand for fuelwood for household energy exceeds supply Lack of accountability for natural resource management Unclear tenure/ leasehold rights Inadequate institutional structures Strategic Objectives/ Indicators Restore and enhance the quality of natural forests.

Water Resources 1. Current Status and Issues  71.  Water resources are most precious in Afghanistan. These resources must be managed efficiently and sustainably as they are fundamentally scarce and drought is a common occurrence. Currently opportunities exist to improve efficient water planning, use and mangement with only 15 percent of run-off contributing to aquifer recharge and irrigation system efficiency levels of about 25 percent, when a level of 40 percent should be the norm, and can be achieved with feasible levels of investment. Moreover, demands on the resource have grown and are expected to continue to grow. The scope also exists to expand irrigation area. FAO has estimated that longterm water availability is about 2800m3/head /year, enough to irrigate 5 million ha., which is significantly higher than the current 2.6 million command area.  17   Draft Report  72. Total developed irrigated area in 1978 was estimated to be 2.63 Mha,2 consisting of (i) 1.32 Mha by traditional methods from perennial rivers (ii) 0.98 Mha by traditional methods from emphemeral streams, kereze, and arhads; and (iii) 0.33 Mha by modern systems from perennial rivers. Only 1.44 Mha had sufficient water supply to support double cropping. Approximately 2.3 million ha. or 90 percent of total area uses traditional schemes developed and built by farmers, and operated and maintained according to traditional communal customs and practices. 73. The effects of war and neglect on these systems have not been systematically assessed. While there has been substantial financial and technical support for rehabilitation since 1989 from NGOs and UN agencies, comprehensive data on the scale and the extent of successful and sustainable rehabilitation is not available. In 1997 FAO estimated that about 1.7 mha required rehabilitation, and another 0.68 mha required improved water management. Also, a limited number of large formal irrigation systems have been built operated and maintained by the state, and are in need of major rehabilitation. Most are currently dysfunctional. These large formal schemes raise significant technical, institutional and social issues as the schemes will require infrastructure rehabilitation, repairs to dams and other major structures, and many, particularly those in the plains and in the south, have serious water management problems including water logging and salinity. 74. The Government needs to develop appropriate policies to effectively manage and monitor groundwater development and use. Groundwater, whether a part of annual recharge, or the non-renewable reserves, could serve as the most important safeguard in times of drought or low water availability (a principle mentioned in the 1981 Water Law). Legal and regulatory approaches require effective public institutions and obedience to the rule of law. A more promising approach that is being applied in many areas of the developing world is to involve communities directly in conjunctive use and management of surface and groundwater, in some cases by forming special groundwater management districts in which all water users (surface and groundwater) have an effective role in decision making. 75. While the increase in vulnerability to low rainfall can be traced to unsustainable land use practicesinvolving over grazing, deforestation and cultivation of marginal lands, these practices are an outcome from increased population density, a shrinking natural resource base, and limited opportunities for alternative employment and income. When prolonged drought occurs, asset depletion, low agricultural production, increased indebtedness; low food supply, poor health and increased uncertainty sustain a downward spiral that is difficult to recover from when rainfall returns to normal. For this reason providing support to the offfarm rural economy is a high priority, as efficiently targeted and implemented labor-intensive interventions to rehabilitate rural infrastructure including roads provide needed employment and livelihood improvement. 76. Given the country's variable climatic conditions and vulnerability to drought, information systems on current and expected weather, rain and water accumulation in winter snow pack are important in terms of both farmer decision making and cropping enterprises, and at a macro level in preparing short and long term strategies to reduce vulnerability to drought. Such strategies may involve water conservation and efficient water use; water harvesting and watershed management, small storage dams, river basin planning and management. In Afghanistan data on the amount of water stored in the snow pack is especially important because snowmelt is the primary source of spring runoff and river flow. Snow surveys to measure such water storage and forecast runoff are common in river basins in many countries. 2  As reported in the Afghanistan Agricultural Strategy, FAO, 1997  18   Draft Report 77. The river basin (and sub-basin as appropriate) should be the basic unit for planning and management. To enable multi-sector and often conflicting demands to be managed, a national water coordination agency should be established with responsibility for guiding all aspects of water use across all ministries (planning and regulation) as well as monitoring, protection and conservation of the resource base. Sustainable management of rivers and their use for irrigation and hydropower, the management of flood hazards and risks, as well as other uses, are and will be important in determining the prosperity of the country. 78. There is scope for transfer of the management of larger irrigation schemes to the beneficiaries. The state owns about 0.4 million ha. within such schemes. Their rehabilitation should be based an approaches which are an outcome of active community participation, as the community groups will take over the management. 79. The issues outlined above provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, lead to the identification of short and medium term needs, and policy requirements for a subsector development framework which is summarized in Table 2. The framework is discussed in detail in Appendix 3. 2. Development Framework a. Short Term Interventions  80. A Government priority is to develop a long-term strategy to manage water resources and reduce vulnerability to drought. The strategy should focus on increasing the water capital, and improving water use efficiency. Specifically, the strategy should include (i) water harvesting and watershed management, including more water storage structures both small and large, (ii) effective control of groundwater use, (iii) better information systems on water availability, (iv) eliminating unsustainable land use practices (v) improved intake structures and corresponding on-farm water management, (vi) the management transfer of state owned schemes, plus, (vii) extending the irrigated command area. 81. In the short term the initial emphasis of the strategy and priorities will focus on: investment in the rehabilitation of traditional small and medium irrigation schemes, with such programs to play a key role in institutional restructuring and capacity building; planning for the rehabilitation of formal and large scale schemes; establishment of database and information systems; and initiating the institutional change process. 82. Water conservation and harvesting through soil, vegetative and forest cover management, construction of check dams, contour bunds and other facilities to conserve water and enhance groundwater recharge in all watersheds. Global experience has demonstrated in arid environments similar to Afghanistan that water harvesting measures are effective. Water harvesting measures are also labour intensive and offer the Government an opportunity to generate short-term employment. Construction of storage reservoirs in selected river basins and watersheds focusing initially on small reservoirs would support more efficient water use in irrigation by improving farmer's control of water supply. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) 83. Rehabilitation of small to medium scale irrigation schemes requiring infrastructure repairs work that extend beyond routine preventive maintenance and needs resources (funds, technical know-how and skills, construction materials) that farmers and villagers are unable to mobilize. The program of rehabilitation will be based on a systematic technical assessment of problems and consultation with mirabs and farmers. All systems within the basin or sub-basin should be systematically surveyed and assessed before priorities are selected and specific projects formulated in order to ensure that traditional water rights and allocations are preserved, that upstream and downstream impacts and conflicts are 19   Draft Report minimized and mitigated. The rehabilitation of these systems will be community development framework, and it is likely to be linked and livelihood activities. Pilot projects will also be implemented to management of watersheds and water harvesting. (refer Appendix 1 for undertaken within a associated with rural support community proposal details)  84. Planning the rehabilitation of formal and large-scale irrigation schemes. Initial assessment work has commenced in MIWR with schemes identified and preliminary technical assessments to be undertaken. Complementary efforts will be needed to facilitate the management transfer of these systems to the beneficiaries. Users will have to be organized into an appropriate institutional framework and water delivery contracts agreed. This will include a water charging policy and collection mechanism. In addition, detailed design work should continue on partially developed or new schemes. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) 85. Database and information system establishment should commence as soon as practical. Rebuilding the water resources knowledge base will be a collaborative effort of all the core ministries and agencies, coordinated by the Afghan Information Management System (AIMS). The introduction and use of modern information technology including remote sensing and GIS has the potential of greatly increasing the capacity of the core water sector ministries to plan and manage the reconstruction program. A Government task force including AIMS will be required to develop standards and protocols that will enable efficient sharing and use of a wide range of data for different purposes. Coordination of this work by government is essential to ensure all studies contribute the overall goal. Re-establishing the hydrologic and hydro-geologic network (including stations to monitor snowpack) is a high priority, though it should be undertaken within the context of earlier network designs. The historical knowledge base of maps, reports and studies, is partly lost and every effort should be made to reassemble these. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) 86. The need for appropriate institutional arrangements for water resources management is an essential perquisite. These options should be assessed in the context of the broader review of required sector agencies and their respective roles. International experience has shown that the river basin is not only the best unit for planning but also for management of both water supply and demand, and conservation of natural resources. The Government is considering an institutional mechanism for management of each major river basin of the country. There is however an additional consideration that will be very important for Afghanistan, as each of its major river basins are shared with its neighbours. Negotiating and monitoring agreements with each of its neighbours to ensure that Afghanistan has an equitable share of the resource will be a demanding task. It will require establishment of a committee or special body with appropriate specialized technical staff to carry out this task. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) b. Medium Term Programs /Investments  87. The medium term interventions will involve expansion of the investment program, and implementation of institutional and policy reforms. Key activities will include: (i) (ii) Expansion of the traditional small and medium irrigation system rehabilitation program under the community development program; Implementation of investment program for rehabilitation of formal and largescale irrigation schemes. The rehabilitation program to be based on feasibility studies on each scheme and a selection criteria for prioritising individual schemes. Institutional reform and capacity building (refer section V for more detail); Policy and legislative reform for water policy and rights, water charges, community based watershed management and irrigation system transfer to 20  (iii) (iv)   Draft Report users, groundwater and inter-country water transfers (refer section VI for more detail).

C.  Community Development Programs 1. Current Status and Issues  88. In Afghanistan the large number of individual communities (about 18,000) has traditionally had a keen interest in the use and protection of natural resources. Communal management, risk mitigation and coping strategies were a common feature of these traditional agricultural systems. Such community mechanisms have been weakened by years of conflict and a legacy of displaced people, widows and orphans, disabled and  21   Draft Report uneducated groups. To re-establish social cohesion, village/district level decision making structures must be rebuilt with appropriate policies and sensitive programs and projects. 89. Different communities have distinct social characteristics and different levels of participation by their members, but it is a characteristic of Afghan communities that there be broad consensus over matters that affect all members. The Shura, or community committee is primarily a means of achieving broad understanding and agreement amongst the leading members of society to avoid conflict. The Shura is not necessarily fully representative of the community, and democratic principles of equality and majority rule are not the basis for decisions, which come about through extended discussion. Shuras are valuable resources for reducing conflict and encouraging cooperation and collaboration. Whether the views of minorities, women or the poor become part of the discussions depends very much on the local Shura. Those with the fewest resources are the least likely to contribute to discussions or benefit from economic opportunities for the village. In some places, powerful minorities control much of the land and the local political processes. 90. Community development approaches may conflict with these groups, sometimes to the exclusion of participatory approaches. NGOs have been active in Afghanistan working with rural communities, and have developed a number of approaches to facilitate community participation and development. For example, the Aga Khan Development Network, have a clear method for facilitating growth of inclusive, participatory mechanisms beginning with close collaboration with the Shura. In Badakshan, increasing success and responsibility on the part of Shuras has given rise to expanded programs managed by committees and interest groups operating with approval of the Shura. The ""Community Fora"" working with UN Habitat in Bamiyan is another approach to expanding alternative, development oriented groups. As the community committees (shura) become a central feature of development programming it will be important for the international community to remember that, (i) there is no stereotype shura; (ii) social differences exist between regions which must be taken into account; and, (iii) the status of women varies across the country, which is reflected in their role in the shura. 91. The vast majority of communities lack basic services, especially communications, clean drinking water, and health facilities. While agriculture is the basis of the economy limited advice on new technologies and varieties is available, and institutional credit facilities are absent. Community infrastructure related to agricultural production, such as irrigation systems and water impoundments, bridges and roads are badly degraded. Community participation in economic development decision-making has been relatively narrowly focused but there are strong village consensus reckoning devices in the Shuras and reliable mechanisms to help vulnerable groups. The community based approach to development will require, (i) strong support programs to assist empowered communities to develop the skills to fully participate in the decision making processes and (ii) funding mechanisms so the processes will have practical outcomes that improve livelihoods. 92. Currently the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development has very limited if any resources with which to assist communities. As part of the AIA policy, it will need to redefine its role and functions, and restructure to effectively assist communities. MRRD has little recent experience in designing, surveying and implementing and managing communitybased programs. Its traditional style of operation will be inappropriate for community-driven approaches that require partnership with communities. Provincial offices have been destroyed, and only a few are still functioning through budgetary and program assistance from UN agencies and NGOs. Consequently, the database relating to the status of community infrastructure and community organisations is highly fragmented. 93. The role of these offices in the context of increased decentralization of decisionmaking and enhanced community empowerment is yet to be defined. The scale of 22   Draft Report rehabilitation of the infrastructure will be determined by identified requirements of the revised roles, and the human resource development and capacity building needs will be designed to support the revised functions. 94. The issues outlined above provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, lead to the identification of short and medium term needs, and policy requirements for a medium term community development framework which is summarized in Table 3. The framework is discussed in detail in Appendix 4. 2. Development Framework a. Short Term Interventions  95. One of the major requirements to help implement the proposed community programs is a more detailed village level database. In the short term, the World Food Program (WFP) annual village survey based upon a sample of about 1250 villages is the only significant database. This survey data requires more in depth analysis than has been possible, and further refinement of the questionnaire to enable additional data collection. In the medium term, the annual village survey should become an integral part of the sector's information base. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) 96. Community empowerment and the use of participatory planning mechanisms are identified by the AIA as a cornerstone of its development framework. The concept of community development, empowerment, or participation in Afghanistan requires elaboration as it means communities become involved with community needs assessment, program planning, implementation and management. The concept of community development and the model may be country or even regionally specific and evolve with experience and experimentation. Assistance will be provided to support community empowerment and the development of effective development models. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) 97. Community development projects have been implemented by NGOs for many years. The mission has identified over 120 ongoing development projects with a community based approach and a total annual budget of over $40 million. To utilize this experience and avoid duplication, the MRRD programs will need careful coordination. A major initial step will be to reorient MRRD staff to the changed relationship with communities and NGOs. MRRD staff will need formal and informal training in participatory approaches and in working with NGOs at the village /district level. All communities must be made aware of the changes taking place and of the opportunities that the changes offer them. (refer Appendix 1 for proposal details) b. Medium Term Programs/Investments  98. The medium term program will involve investments in: community empowerment and organization, village planning and decision-making processes; and formalizing relationships with government agencies, NGOs and communities that had started on a pilot basis to formulate community development models. The models should be developed by implementing agreed priorities within the context of the communities' use of micro-watershed natural resources. Actual activities could include: rehabilitation of rural roads; water storage or small-scale irrigation infrastructure; re-establishing fodder and agro-forestry plots; livestock and agricultural activities; creation of off-farm small enterprises and related training courses.  23   Draft Report Table 3: Community Development Program Matrix Key Issues Degraded community infrastructure and essential services Strategic Objectives/ Indicators Self-reliant village and district communities Needs assessment Short-Term Program Medium Development (1-2 Years) Framework (2-5 Years) Community empowerment and community based public works program Start-up of a community based program including criteria for identification of villages and surveys of required works Community training programs in project design, planning and implementation Include MRDD in the broader institutional assessment of sector line ministries Repair physical infrastructure of MRRD in accordance with reforms Undertake initial training programs in needs assessment, databases, project planning and project finance Shortterm reorientation training A community development model which empower communities to manage local investment and natural resource management decisions A formal smallscale irrigation program managed by empowered communities and using a combination of village labour and NGO expertise to implement Internalised MRRD training programs for enhancing community skills Policy Agenda Empower communities to undertake ownership and management policy formulation Defining the precise role of empowered community representatives (shuras) in project design and implementation In-service training programs  Rehabilitation of water delivery infrastructure for drinking and irrigation  All villages to have a reliable source of water  Strengthening community skills in the planning and implementation of projects Redefining line ministry (MRRD) role  Communities capable of full participation in local natural resource management decisions A clear statement of the role and functions of reformed MRRD An appropriate working environment A strong MRRD capable of supporting, and monitoring community based programs A clear understanding of the role of MRRD staff in the reformed ministry in relation to participatory planning Village level databases  Implement approved recommendations of the institutional assessment Repaired and reformed national and provincial offices Formalise and internalise training programs for MRRD staff A clear mandate based on the detailed institutional assessment Establishment of an annual village survey based on a fixed sample including each district  Define the public sector role in empowered community development programs  Damaged physical infrastructure of MRRD Weak institutional capacity  Human resources development policies  Redefining role of provincial level office of MRRD Inadequate village level data to apply selection criteria  Sample village level assessments e.g. Build on WFP work  Sector information base; future of AIMS  D.  Agriculture 1. Current Status and Issues  99. The arable agricultural resource base is about 7.5 million ha. of cultivable land, which is divided into rainfed and irrigated land. The rainfed area is estimated at about 4 million ha. but, the area actually cultivated in a given year varies considerably depending upon the climatic factors such as precipitation and the area left to fallow. The recent succession of dry years has reduced the annually cultivated rainfed area to less than 0.5 million ha. from a maximum of around 1.4 million ha. Rainfed agriculture is largely undertaken in northern provinces and is dominated by cereal production. 100. In recent years, partly as a result of the drought, rainfed cereal productivity levels have been low, averaging some 0.6 tonnes/ha. Currently, rainfed cereal production has fallen to about 10 percent of expected production in a normal rainfall year. As a consequence, food security, especially in these northern areas, is the first priority. Recovery  24   Draft Report strategies for these areas must be predicated on the assumption of highly variable rainfall and risk mitigation. Farmers must be able to respond to favourable weather conditions quickly and, since yields will always be relatively low, in a cost effective manner. 101. Farmers must have access to quality seed, fertilizer and farm draught or mechanical power. In addition, they need technical advice on recent developments in dry land farming systems including water harvesting, and access to effective plant protection and disease control systems. To avail themselves of quality inputs, farmers will need to have access to rural finance. In the last 10 years, NGOs, UN agencies and in particular FAO, and the donor community have been involved in agricultural rehabilitation, developing farmer based seed multiplication programs, and promoting technology transfer and supporting agricultural service delivery systems. The lessons learned need to be incorporated in planned strategies and future programs. 102. There is considerable potential for productivity improvements even allowing for the low and variable rainfall regime. ICARDA has promoted drought tolerant varieties and cultural practices for cereals, legumes and forage crops that would significantly increase returns and could double current yields. With extensive and well-designed micro-watershed management and the adoption of micro water harvesting techniques the potential for further yield increases is available. This potential to improve rainfed cereal yields that rainfed farming could play an important role in agriculture sector recovery. In the longer term, the possibility of Afghanistan being able to produce around 1.5 to 2.0 million tonnes of cereals annually, from its rainfed farming areas would transform agricultural development. Food security concerns could be relegated to very specific marginal areas, and high value irrigation water could be used, for the most part, to grow high value cash crops. A further advantage of such a strategy is that it is based on the careful management of micro watersheds, which means that communities are drawn into an integrated approach to resource use combining water, forestry, rangeland and crops. This is the traditional Afghan approach, which has largely broken down in the course of the past 20 years. 103. The relatively low and variable rainfall regime places a premium on irrigated land. It is estimated that 85 percent of all agricultural output is derived from the irrigated areas. The general management of water resources and the efficiency of irrigation systems is therefore of critical importance to the whole food economy. While the potential irrigable area has been estimated at 5 million ha., currently the total developed area is around 2.6 million ha. Under normal conditions about 1.4 million ha have sufficient water for double cropping. Irrigation systems are: traditional systems using informal river diversion structures maintained by the users, which account for about 55 percent of the total irrigated area; traditional systems based on natural springs, kareze or arhads, which account for about 30 percent of irrigated area; and more modern formal river diversion structures, which were built in the 1960/1970s, and which account for the remaining 15 percent of the irrigated area. 104. A key feature of irrigation systems is their very low efficiency rating of about 25 percent, which means there is considerable scope for reducing the wastage of water, and increasing the irrigated area. Reliable data on the current extent and productivity of irrigated agriculture is fragmented, largely due to the combined impact of recent conflicts and the prolonged drought. Many systems have been damaged or suffer from lack of maintenance. A number of the more modern systems and larger traditional systems also suffer from salinity and waterlogging problems. The productivity of all types of systems can be improved substantially. Firstly, improved on-farm water management and appropriate inputs will substantially increase yields. The average national yield of irrigated wheat in recent years has been around 1.3 tonnes/ha. With improved water management and inputs a long-term goal of a national average yield for irrigated wheat of 3.0-3.5 tonnes/ha is feasible. For a comparison, the average yield of CIMMYT bread wheat lines in the period 1995-2000 under a range of agroclimatic conditions varied from 4.6-5.7 tonnes /ha. In addition, to yield 25   Draft Report improvements, better water management will contribute to higher cropping intensities, which are a function of water availability and length of growing season. Better water management should enable the proportion of the irrigated command area, which can be double cropped, to rise from 50 percent to at least 65 percent although the second crop enterprise may be restricted to forage. 105. The principal output of the irrigated systems is wheat, accounting for about 80 percent of production, and a range of horticultural crops. It is expected that irrigated wheat area will decline as rainfed wheat production becomes more productive and farmers contribution towards the cost of water is increased. The development and rehabilitation of irrigated agriculture requires significant investment, which has to be recovered, and a single crop of wheat, even at a yield of 3.0 tonnes/ha is unlikely to be sufficient to enable this recovery. A much higher proportion of the irrigated area could support high value cash crops. Agro-forestry and horticulture is a small but previously highly productive sub-sector, at one time accounting for 40 percent of export earnings. These crops plus others, which have not traditionally been grown in Afghanistan, should be assessed and where feasible piloted. 106. The issues outlined above provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, lead to the identification of short and medium term needs, and policy requirements for a subsector development framework which is summarized in Table 4. The framework is discussed in detail in Appendix 5. 2. Development framework a. Short Term Interventions  107. The conflict and drought of recent years have had a devastating impact on the horticulture industry. Precise figures are not available, but observation and small surveys suggest that approximately 50 percent of orchards have been destroyed. The feasibility of rehabilitating the industry will be determined by the potential to compete in international markets. Other players have entered the markets vacated by Afghanistan and regaining former market share will be difficult. A detailed survey of potential markets and their requirements needs to be undertaken. (refer Appendix 1 for details) 108. The current status of irrigated agriculture raises a number of policy issues related to maximizing the efficient use of available water. System efficiency levels are reportedly as low as 25 percent; and the potential exists to improve on-farm water management efficiencies. If the system improvements are to be sustainable farmers will have to accept the concept of water charges. One option may be to have this done obliquely, by including a water charge in a land tax, a concept with which Afghan farmers are familiar. Further, such as tax can also be made progressive, which would minimize social discord. Such a policy will send price signals to farmers, which will increase pressure to improve water use efficiency, double cropping, and the production of higher value crops, and crops with lower water requirements. 109. Inputs such as seed, fertilizer and agro chemicals are being provided by a number of donors including NGOs. In some instances, inputs are being provided free of charge. There is a need for tight coordination of input provision to ensure that both quantity and quality issues are adequately addressed. In particular, there is a need to form a consensus on a strategy, which moves the current situation towards the Government vision of private sector led distribution networks for the main inputs. Such a strategy will need to address policy issues, which include the role of the public sector in plant protection programs and the need for regulation of quality controls of seeds, fertilizers and agro-chemicals provided by the private sector.  26   Draft Report 110. Formerly, Afghanistan produced a number of industrial crops such as cotton and sugar beet, which were linked to substantial processing facilities. These facilities are largely moribund. Feasibility studies will be needed to determine the prospects for the industry and based on the outcomes of these studies investment requirements identified. Future investment will be based on private sector involvement. (refer Appendix 1 for details) 111. The recovery of commercial agriculture and much of the cereal sub-sector will require finance, which is not readily available. Currently farmers in need of credit are dependent upon informal sources. It is vitally important to the success of the proposed community based approach that alternative sources of finance are made available. The reestablishment of agricultural credit facilities requires detailed assessment on the feasibility of introducing both community and asset based lending. There is a need to attract commercial funds into agriculture which means asset based lending using land titles as collateral and related bankruptcy procedures. In term of asset based lending these instruments are not well established; and since it is estimated that less than 25 percent of landholders have clear legal title to their land, collateral will be a constraint. A review of the rural financial sector to identify an appropriate institutional framework is required, this will include an assessment of existing functioning and non-functioning bank and non bank financial institutions. (refer Appendix 1 for details) 112. The AIA outlined strategy in the NDF that public institutions will be restructured to undertake core functions represents a significant departure from the traditional role of the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (MAAH). A sector institutional review and analysis is required. In a restructured institution, core responsibilities are likely to encompass policy and planning, plant disease and pest control, certification systems for agricultural inputs and products, animal health and applied agricultural research. Delivery of agricultural extension services will be assessed to determine the most effective and efficient delivery system, be it private or public provision. This institutional reorganisation will result in a smaller organisation. The infrastructure support and staff retraining programs will be based on these new roles. (refer Appendix 1 for details) b. 113. MediumTerm Programs/Investments  The key medium term programs of the agricultural sub-sector will include: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi) (vii) Private sector provision of agricultural inputs (fertilizer, chemicals); Private sector led seed industry building on existing private seed multiplication farms; Public sector provision of plant protection and disease control monitoring system, seed certification and regulatory systems for fertilizer and agrochemicals; Farmer based comprehensive technology transfer program for dryland and irrigated farming systems, improving production and water use efficiency; Community based and large scale rehabilitation programs; Private sector led investments in horticulture production, processing and marketing systems, and in industrial crops; Alternative and innovative crop pilot program (undertaken as part of the ARTTS).  27   Draft Report Table 4: Agriculture Matrix Key Issues Inadequate and outdated dryland farming technology Availability of drought resistant varieties of cereals, legumes and fodder.

Livestock Programs 1. Current Status and Issues  114. Traditionally, livestock activities have been an integral part of most farming systems in Afghanistan, with livestock and their products contributing to farm draught power, family nutrition, the raw materials for household goods (wool, hair, hides, dung) and tradable  28   Draft Report products. Often livestock activities provided the household with its only source of cash income. Previously the livestock sub-sector accounted for 40 percent of total export earnings but it is estimated that now, livestock numbers are about half the level of a decade ago. 115. Currently, livestock raisers have serious problems involving loss of livestock, decreased productivity due to declining feed and overgrazing, and the affects of animal diseases, which are not being adequately treated. Much of the irrigated land, which formerly supported livestock, is now without water. The small poultry flocks, which were almost exclusively owned and managed by women have for many households almost disappeared, while the smallest and poorest farmers who formerly kept at least one cow to provide for their subsistence needs are now without animals. Disease problems are only being partially contained. Rangeland is overgrazed and nomadic and semi sedentary sheepherders are operating with high livestock mortality rate. Improvements in the small ruminant sector, even in non-drought times, are hampered by traditional user rights and grazing practices and a preoccupation by raisers with livestock numbers rather than the productivity. 116. Over the last decade in the absence of MAAH provision of animal health and livestock services, a number of development partners (UNDP, FAO, bilateral donors and NGOs) have supported a number of project activities. These include the establishment of an alternative system of veterinary field units (VFUs), which have been established in every province and in most districts. While the objective of these units was to become financially self sufficient, in most locations the drought and conflict have reduced both livestock requirements and farmer client capacity to pay for the services. Other key donor activities have involved vaccination programs and deworming treatments. While these activities are beneficial, currently the coverage is inadequate. 117. In the commercial and semi-commercial sector, most herds and flocks have been substantially reduced, and investments in assets such as feed mills, commercial poultry and milk processing facilities have been lost. To re-establish these activities investments in the semi-commercial poultry and dairy sectors will be important if intending producers are to access breeding stock, breeding material, commercial feedstuffs and equipment. Considerable investment is also required for re-establishing feed mills, poultry and milk processing plants. Private sector investment is needed with respect to poultry, red meat and dairy production. Investments need to be made in production and processing facilities, which add value to livestock products for domestic consumption or export. These include operations such as abattoirs, dairy processing plants, tanneries, wool processors and fattening operations. The re-establishment of these facilities would also create a market in that area for small-holder-produced livestock products, to which most small holders presently have no access. 118. Within the MAAH two sub-directorates are responsible for livestock. Currently, both are ineffective as they lack resources to undertake existing functions. Most, if not all of the staff would require retraining. Further, there are also significant weaknesses in private and public sector skills in commercial and semi commercial poultry and dairy production, which need to be addressed. The facilities that government formerly maintained to support livestock production, are no longer operational, and are mostly inappropriate for the anticipated new core functions of government agencies. The current absence of reliable information particularly with respect to livestock numbers and location, and fodder resources limits the capacity for planning development interventions in the sector. 119. The issues outlined above provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, lead to the identification of short and medium term needs, and policy requirements for a subsector development framework which is summarized in Table 5. The framework is discussed in detail in Appendix 6.  29   Draft Report 2. Development Framework a. Short Term Interventions  120. The development of a medium term institutional framework to encourage smallholder and commercial livestock development will be influenced by the outcome of the government review of public sector roles and the consequent restructuring of the MAAH. Once this role is clear an appropriate structure and staffing schedule can be developed, and personnel can be trained to perform the tasks for which they remain responsible. Appropriate regulations and legislation will have to be developed to support the new structure. This allocation of responsibilities is particularly important in the livestock sub-sector, as important animal and public health issues need to be resolved. 121. A key initial activity will be a livestock inventory assessment, which will provide the data for planning activities. It will involve a rapid rural appraisal of all provinces, focusing on livestock numbers and distribution, feed resources, husbandry and livestock offtake strategies, and livestock support services. A number of activities will be implemented to improve smallholder livestock productivity; these are likely to encompass fodder production, artificial insemination, vaccination and disease control and animal health and livestock support services. These activities to be supported within a component of a community based development program. Additional support for the small-holder sector should target poultry producers with expanded village poultry distribution, and improved production capability for semi-commercial producers including improved disease control, deworming and supplementary feeding for female breeding stock. Further support to the dairy sector through an expanded programme of artificial insemination using deep frozen semen, liquid nitrogen storage and distribution, and improved fodder production in irrigated areas will be required. (refer Appendix 1 for details) 122. Studies will be required to determine the most effective and efficient systems for livestock vaccination production and delivery, and for provision of animal health and livestock support services. A vaccine quality control laboratory is required, and it will be necessary to define sentinel service needs against trans-boundary diseases, diagnostic laboratory functions and needs, and to identify the requirements for functioning animal health laboratories. (refer Appendix 1 for details) 123. Training to support the new core role and functions of government agencies in animal health services, in meat inspection and in public health is needed. This will also involve infrastructure and equipment support. The input should include post-graduate training for key government positions in epidemiology and technical laboratory positions, and training for strengthened and properly supported regulatory units. Longer term institutional strengthening of government roles would include permanent and strategically located quarantine points manned by well trained and supported staff, and a strengthened central epidemiological capability with field and quarantine activities linked to a central epidemiologist. Other objectives in animal health include linkages between the veterinary department and the international reference laboratories of neighbouring countries. These would lead to an ability to comply with importing countries animal health requirements to facilitate development of export markets for sheep and mutton. (refer Appendix 1 for details) 124. Development of rangeland management policy (refer to Appendix 2), and a rangeland research structure and extension capability in nomadic sheepherder areas is required. This would permit investigation of offtake strategies and seasonal value adding practices, such as fattening for rangeland producers, and in time should lead to a reduction in grazing pressure and improved nomadic flock productivity. (refer Appendix 1 for details)  30   Draft Report 125. Formal credit facilities will be required to support private sector investment for processing facilities such as abattoirs, feed mills and semi/commercial poultry production. (refer Appendix 1 for details) b. 126. Medium Term Programs/Investments  The key medium term programs in the livestock sub-sector will include: (i) Sustainable smallholder livestock production systems, as an integral component of a community development programs; (ii) Private sector commercial livestock enterprises, with access to rural credit; (iii) Development of private sector based livestock production and animal health input supply and support services; (iv) Establishing a regulatory environment for livestock production, quality assurance systems, animal disease control, and for animal public health; (v) Livestock quarantine services and control systems.

Agriculture Research and Technology Transfer 1. Current Status and Issues  127. In the past, prior to the conflict, the agricultural research and technology transfer system (ARATTS) was substantial, though not always focused on the real needs of the Afghan farmer. This system is no longer functioning and there has been widespread destruction of the infrastructure and loss of skilled human resources. When operational, the Department of Agricultural Research consisted of 11 sub-departments and the department carried out its functions through 24 research stations (7 main, and 17 sub-main), covering the geographic and agroclimatic variability of the country. The total area of the stations was  32   Draft Report about 1750 ha. Before the degradation of the system, these research stations had 1020 staff member, of which 25 percent were technical research staff (graduates). 128. In the future, the ARATTS network will focus on adaptive research and technology transfer directly related to agricultural development, and will not be involved in basic research. Internationally, a wealth of new technologies developed for dryland areas are available. ARATTS major role would be to test, adapt, and disseminate technologies suitable to local conditions. Demand-driven onfarm participatory approaches to research and development will be employed, and use the farming systems approach to agricultural research and development, and the integrated watershed planning approach to natural resource management. Institutional and policy innovations will support on enhanced contribution of research and technology transfer to agricultural development. Human capacity should be strengthened to contribute to institutional innovation in agricultural research and technology transfer for development. This requires new management training methodologies, technology transfer and dissemination techniques. 129. The issues outlined above provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, lead to the identification of short and medium term needs, and policy requirements for a subsector development framework which is summarized in Table 6. The framework is discussed in detail in Appendix 7. 2. Development Framework a. Short Term Interventions be undertaken to assess the needs, and operate an efficient ARATTS, that farming needs. This assessment to be review. The principles underlying the  130. It is an essential requirement that a review policy, functions and institutional structure to establish will respond to farmer identified priorities and to future undertaken as part of the larger MAAH institutional future shape of ARATTS should include; (i) (ii) (iii)  (iv)  Integrating onfarm participatory research and technology transfer activities into practical development programs; Development of demand-driven, community-based research and technology transfer programs that recognize the special needs of rural poor, especially the disabled, children, and rural women; Adoption of innovative methodological approaches, which utilize the farming systems approach to research and development, integrated natural resource research sites, integrated watershed management, and incorporate socioeconomic aspects with technical and biophysical research programs; and Determining the most effective institutional framework for linking research with extension delivery agencies and organisations.  131. Programs will be directed at important research and technology transfer areas that previously were either neglected, or not given due attention by ARATTS. Such areas were natural resource management (conservation and use of soil, water, and vegetative cover), biotechnology and information technology, socio-economics, monitoring and evaluation, and adoption and impact research. The ARATTS agenda will include gender mainstreaming, rural women needs and their role in resource management. Based on assessed priorities a particular focus may be given to research for developing the vast rainfed areas in the northern and northeast provinces, where potential exists for productivity improvement. Institutional and policy innovations will support timely and cost-effective services to strengthen agricultural research and technology transfer for the poor.  33   Draft Report 132. ARATTS policies and institutional arrangements will ensure appropriate use of new technologies for increasing food security and alleviating poverty. Considerations in this respect are modern technologies, managing intellectual property, information systems, and strategic planning through decision support methods. The aim will be to ensure that stakeholders are active participants in determining the research and extension agenda, and involved in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the programs. This will need partnerships and networks, negotiation and conflict resolution, effective governance bodies and management practices, and decentralized and well coordinated research and extension activities. Farmers and the emerging private sector, including NGOs, will be important partners in generating new relevant knowledge responding to social needs. 133. As most research work will be applied research, with ARATTS activities to be implemented on farmers field, it will be important to determine the most effective institutional framework for linking research with extension delivery agencies either public or private, and sector organisations to develop these linkages. This appropriate framework will be assessed and determined as part of the institutional review of MAAH. b. Medium Term Program  134. In the medium term, ARATTS policy and the required institutional reforms will be implemented. These institutional and policy issues are covered in more detail in section V and VI respectively of this report. Implementation of these reforms will require large investments in infrastructure, equipment and human resource training to establish an effective and efficient ARATTS.

G.  Off-Farm Employment 1. Current Status and Issues  135. Off-farm income generation activities are an integral part of rural production systems. It is generally accepted that families with less than 0.5 ha of irrigated land have difficulty earning a living solely from agricultural production in most parts of Afghanistan. This means that about 65 percent of farming families rely upon off-farm income generating activities to achieve a modest living. In addition, there are areas where farming has always been  34   Draft Report marginal. Traditionally, the main sources of off-farm income have been hired labour, small scale enterprises and use of forest products other than timber. The principal small-scale enterprises include carpet weaving, bee-keeping, cheese making, skin processing, sericulture, other handicrafts and rural repair shops. 136. A key feature of many of these rural enterprises is that they operate in villages that are relatively inaccessible. This impacts on both the cost of external inputs, the market opportunities and the price for products. In supporting programs to assist such enterprises, financial feasibility will be a key factor. 2. Development Framework a. Short Term Interventions  137. For small-scale rural enterprises to flourish will require a supporting package of services, which should include the provision of raw materials, training and market outlets. It is proposed that the most feasible solution to meeting these needs would be the rural cooperative with an apex-marketing arm in the main urban centres. In the short to medium term such development could be supported by an NGO with experience in this area. This initiative would have a strong poverty alleviation impact. 138. This type of organisation and its activities is well suited to promoting and being promoted by enterprises undertaken by women. A range of activities could be supported by individual rural cooperatives run by women for women, but the key to success is the organisation of the marketing function. The rural cooperative becomes the vehicle for extending a range of benefits including training in particular crafts and skills as well as a medium for micro- finance facilities and the the transfer of information from educated women to those less well educated. 139. The issues outlined above provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, lead to the identification of short and medium term needs, and policy requirements for a development framework which is summarized in Table 7.

NEEDS ASSESSMENT:INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND CAPACITY BUILDING  140. AIA presented the draft National Development Framework to the donor Implementation Group in April 2002. This Framework sets out key principles, policies and strategies to guide the formulation and implementation of the Afghanistan Recovery and Reconstruction Program. This framework is especially relevant to the natural resources and agriculture sector. The institutions in these sectors are faced with developing a new vision of their future role, revision of the policy and institutional framework for the sector, and the massive task of institutional restructuring and capacity building to enable the respective line ministries, provincial and district offices to lead the recovery and reconstruction program. The Government's guiding principles in this regard are as follows: (i) The line ministries and other state entities will be responsible for overall natural resource planning, policies and related management parameters, the formulation of programs to deliver agreed public services to the community level, including technology transfer, the regulation of private sector activities and the monitoring of performance of development programs. Implementation, to the extent possible, will be entrusted to the private sector, including beneficiary communities. In this regard Government will create the enabling environment for the operation of national and international firms (in particular for engineering and construction). Local communities will be empowered to decide their development priorities, to contribute to implementation of their projects and activities where possible, and to monitor the work of government agencies and the private sector. Government's strategy will focus in the near-term on creating employment and supporting livelihoods at the community level.  (ii)  141. These principles indicate the need for a complete review of the current institutional structure governing the natural resources and agriculture sector at all levels, from the national to the village level. The existing structure is a legacy of several highly centralised administrations whose views were diametrically opposed to the decentralised approach of the present administration. In the short to medium term the line ministries will undergo a process of change management to move away from their current all encompassing functions to one, which reflects the vision of a set of core functions for public sector agencies. A. Natural Resource and Agriculture Sector National Institutional Structure  142. Currently, there are three ministries primarily involved in natural resource and agriculture sector management. They are the Ministry for Rehabilitation and Rural Development (MRRD), the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (MAAH) and the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources (MIWR). In addition, the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP) has considerable influence over river regimes by virtue of their hydropower schemes and the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is involved in construction and work schemes at the rural level. The roles and functions of these ministries do not form a coherent structure capable of delivering the sustainable and efficient use of natural resources especially water. There are overlapping functions particularly with regard to irrigation programs, and significant gaps in the management of natural resources. It will be necessary to review the mandates of these ministries and to formulate a more holistic view of natural resource management, which will ensure efficient resource allocations to the various users of natural resources. 143. The process of internalising the new vision of Government in Afghanistan and reshaping the roles of public sector institutions at the central, provincial and district levels will be gradual but should begin immediately because many aspects of the short-term strategy depend directly on a measure of reorganization and reorientation of the ministries and their 36   Draft Report provincial offices. In effect, there are two parallel processes required. One is to realize the vision in the form of a reformed administrative structure in accordance with the above principles and the envisaged approach to natural resource management. The second is the more pragmatic process of beginning the change process in the existing agencies and influencing the attitudes of staff to the future shape of Government. The latter process is the more sensitive, but requires clear direction from the first. 144. The current composition of sector agencies, their detailed functions and staff complements will be the subject of review. In the context of the current structure of sector agencies such a review should take into account the implications of the following: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi) (vii) Agricultural activity is dependent upon natural resource systems, which need to be sustained. Afghanistan does not have an agency responsible for ensuring that levels of natural resource use are sustainable; The protection of a sustainable level of natural resources must be a priority and cannot be entrusted to one of the major users; In Afghanistan, 80 percent of agricultural output is dependent upon some form of irrigation system; A distinction should be drawn between the largely environmental role of natural forests and the production role of commercial and agro-forestry; Development priorities will be determined at the community level but the aggregation of community demands must be matched to natural resource availability; The delivery of agricultural services will be led by the private sector; The scope for technology transfer is substantial but must be responsive to community priorities.  145. In broad terms, a clear institutional distinction is required between agencies with allocative resource functions and those with user functions. In addition, the institutional arrangements should reflect the community-based approach. The water sub-sector provides a key example of the need for significant institutional reform. In Afghanistan, there is no custodian of water resources to set a limit on the various users. To the extent that available resources are assessed, this is done by the MIWR, which is also the major user of water. In these circumstances, there is no objective way in which the demands of sustainable ecosystems are determined. The recent MIWR-UNICEF water conference (Kabul, April 2002) workshop findings indicated the lack of any commitment to significant institutional restructuring, and limited recognition of the current institutional structures lack of objectivity in allocating water resources. Without significant changes to the institutional structure of natural resource management, especially water, in the next two years, there is limited scope for sustained recovery of the agriculture sector. The NDF promotes the concept of river basin authorities which link together the micro-watersheds managed by their respective communities. It is important that the concept of river basin management is not interpreted as a one-dimensional focus on water. Rather, it should encompass the range of natural resources utilised by the communities at the micro-watershed level. In this way, the mandate of the river basin authority is consistent with the range of natural resources actually being used and needing supervision. B. Individual Ministry Structures and Organisation  146. The current structure of ministries reflects past preferences for a highly centralised form of administration, which is the antithesis of current guidelines calling for decentralised decision-making processes. The organization structures incorporate functions, which often include separate subsidiary structures such as input supply and construction companies. There is considerable scope for divesting ministries of such activities and privatising the assets. 37   Draft Report 147. The key first step in this restructuring and reform process will be the establishment of ""Planning and Implementation Groups""1 in headquarters of the line ministries and in the provincial offices. These Groups will be an integral part of a Ministry's organizational structure and internal operations working with and alongside the reorganized or new functional units in a Ministry. Their mission will be to translate policy and programs into projects, to build new management capacity and the required skills in the ministry and provincial offices. Implementation of projects and related activities (e.g., preparation of technical designs, surveys) will be out-sourced to the private sector, to the maximum extent possible. The Groups will be staffed first through open recruitment from the staff of the respective Ministry based on technical competence, experience and merit, clear TORs and job descriptions. 148. In the short to medium term one outcome of the institutional review and reorganization will be a leaner organization structure, and it is anticipated existing staffing numbers will be reduced. The infrastructure support and capacity building that will be required, will be for the staff that will be implementing these new roles. The ministries will be staffed by highly qualified and experienced individuals, clearly focused on their new role and who will be paid competitive salaries. C. Provincial Natural Resource Management Structure  149. Provincial offices will have different roles and responsibilities in a decentralized system. Planning and Implementation Groups will be established in the provincial offices to undertake program and project management. The offices will require infrastructure support and staff training to undertake their new functions. There are certain key activities they should undertake, namely: (i) (ii) They will be key partners in the participatory planning process based on micro-watersheds. Community representatives (shuras) will play a full part in determining community needs. Provincial offices will help to rank the village/district level proposals through consultations with community shuras and their knowledge of the areas. They will coordinate various types of assistance, and guide NGOs and government agencies toward communities most in need of specific types of assistance. The provincial office should also have a role in project finance, at least to the extent of putting together budgets for each of the districts, ensuring that investment is equitable, and monitoring the flow of funds and completion of projects. Provincial offices will also have a role to play in contracting engineering services directly, assessing proposals from the private sector and NGOs to undertake work, and ensuring that only technically qualified firms and individuals receive contracts. District level consultative groups consisting of representatives from all communities, or a provincial group consisting of district representatives should participate in project selection and performance monitoring. Establishment and maintenance of up to date sector databases and management information systems.  (iii)  (iv)  (v)  150. As with the national institutional framework, at the provincial level there will need to be the same distinction between the agencies responsible for allocative and user functions.  1  The Terms of Reference (TOR) for these Groups is being developed by AACA.  38   Draft Report 1. Village/District Level Structures  151. Initial collaboration between government, NGOs and communities tends to emphasize the flow of material, cash and technology from the outside agencies to the communities. It tends to begin by operating through well-understood local institutions such as the Shuras, placing them increasingly in a new, developmental role. These committees are a prerequisite for broad acceptance and adoption of community-based programs, but over time they are likely to evolve increasingly toward more specialized forms of representative and elected development bodies. This process is not a replacement of traditional Shuras, but seen a predictable move toward more specialized, focused and skilled groups charged with economic advancement of an area. One possible outcome of this process is that individual community based organisations will link together in multi-village committees, or even district level bodies may form a kind of elected council. 152. The above issues provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, identifying short and medium-term needs, and policy requirements for a medium term institutional development framework. The summary framework is outlined in Table 8 and discussed in detail in Appendix 8.

Capacity Building Needs  153. Both government institutions concerned with agricultural development and rural and community organisations have been weakened during the long period of conflict. Ministries have suffered damage to buildings, loss of skilled resources and equipment in Kabul and the provinces, and generally lack the capacity to undertake their functions. A number of services are currently being undertaken by NGOs and community based organizations. For a long period the institutions were not exposed to change or to international best practices in public sector management. The National Development Framework emphasizes the AIA  39   Draft Report commitment to establishing an efficient institutional framework in the sector, which will involve small streamlined government institutions providing the appropriate policy and regulatory environment for community driven development, based on private sector growth and delivery of services. To develop the capacity to achieve this objective will require extensive human resource development and skill retraining. 154. Currently there are a relatively limited number of highly skilled professionals available in technical and management areas to meet the rapidly increasing demand, as the number and scale of the development programs and projects are expanded. These existing resources will be fully utilised, and a strategy needs to be developed to address the anticipated shortfall. Key aspects will involve establishing capacities to provide training, reestablish training institutions, and encourage the return of skilled Afghan professionals. The later have the potential to provide an excellent resource in modern management, economic and technical approaches. Planned technical assistance, which requires foreign inputs should focus on maximising to the extent possible the employment of Afghan professionals. 155. In terms of re-establishing training facilities, one possible strategy would be to upgrade these facilities and courses in Kabul University, or related institutions through a form of joint venture with an international university. University or training institute staff would benefit and training capacity enhanced. Incentive structures could be provided to encourage participation by government and private sector staff. 156. As NGOs employ large numbers of technically qualified people with relevant experience working in the rural sector, mechanisms need to be developed to utilise this expertise, and strengthen links with local line government agencies. In this manner NGO staff could provide on the job training, and at the same time facilitate closer working relationships with these government institutions. Further, as NGOs are significant employers they need to be participants in the development of the strategies for capacity building, and directly support requirements for medium term development. 157. The conversion of community shuras into primary development agents will require considerable reorientation from their traditional role. Just as government agencies and NGOs need to develop the skills to work together with communities, there are skills community members can develop to make their participation in development more effective. These include basic conflict resolution, communication, and formal meeting capabilities, basic numeracy and accounting, project management, participatory planning and monitoring, all of which are needed in the context of larger scale village and community work. Opportunities may develop for project committees to act as contractors in arranging for local construction. Provision of enhanced capabilities to village leaders, strengthens community decision making links to government resources, providing a common platform for discussion, planning, and improved accountability. The evolution and growth of community organizations will require assistance over a defined period. 158. While improving capacity, and developing strategies to meet requirements in the short to medium term, it is essential that specific strategies are prepared to support and improve the role of women in both the government institutions, and in the rural communities and village economy. At the village level, there is a need to develop a comprehensive program, including training, to support the role and participation of women in community decision making and community organisations, and in a range of income generating skills using local raw materials. 159. Training and retraining needs will be large. It will be important that the delivery of training courses to meet these needs is structured to address particular technical and stakeholder requirements. Key considerations in undertaking a training needs assessment are: 40   Draft Report (i) While technical expertise is already available, it requires retraining and reorientation to the community participatory approach envisioned by the AIA. There will be a large demand for retraining programs, especially of technical staff such as engineers. The Government has indicated that in the reform process line ministries are likely to be downsided, and that there will be some staff redundancy. Training programs will need to be prepared to facilitate the structural adjustment of these staff, and prepare them for private sector roles. The need will be for supplemental training involving technical management and private sector skills.  (ii)  160. The issues outlined above provide the basis for formulating strategic objectives, they lead to the identification of short and medium term needs, and policy requirements for a medium term capacity building development framework which is summarized in Table 9.

NEEDS ASSESSMENT: POLICY REFORMS  161. The development frameworks prepared for each sub-sector indicate the need for a number of key policy reviews and for preparatory work on a policy reform agenda during the coming two years. The legislative and regulatory aspects of the policy reform agenda will be undertaken in the medium term. A medium term time frame is required as currently institutional and enforcement capacity is minimal and will need to be established before an effective regulatory framework can be developed. 162. The policy requirements in the short to medium term will be significant for an efficient sector framework to be developed, which will enable improved livelihoods and sustainable resource management. To ensure the development of policies, legislation and regulations which are harmonized across the sub-sectors, a dedicated natural resources policy unit to undertake this work is required. 163. Specific sub-sectors where the policy framework needs to be reviewed are outlined in Table 10, with the identified policy issues and potential legislative and regulatory needs detailed for each sub-sector.  42   Draft Report  Table 10: Policy Agenda Sub Sector Natural Resources Management Policy Issue Forestry Laws and tenure rights Micro- watershed planning Rural energy Environmental protection Water Resources management Watershed (river basin) planning Water Law Groundwater depletion Irrigation management transfer Community empowerment and organisation Agricultural trade Rural Cooperatives Plant protection Seed Certification Land tenure Agricultural finance Technology transfer Livestock Fertilizer distribution Production and importation of vaccines and semen Animal and public health Veterinary services Rangeland grazing Genetic resources ARATTS network Privatisation of state owned assets Micro-finance Tax status of rural SMEs Role of the public sector Gender policy Comments New policy and law is needed.

Implementation Strategies 1. Towards a Development Framework Consensus framework outlined in this report is based on medium term needs. It details key strategies and sector objectives, and provides a framework for and rehabilitation activities supported by the  164. The medium term development identified sub-sector priorities, short and interventions required to achieve agreed prioritising and coordinating recovery development partners.  43   Draft Report 165. The draft framework is the outcome of a wide-ranging consultation with all key stakeholders and it should be treated as the start of a process. It has been revised following initial comments, and the intention is that it be further discussed with the new Transitional Government in late June 2002, and that the government take the lead on reaching a consensus on the framework. The consensus will involve both internal and external aspects. The internal aspect is critically important as agreements and support is required on the priorities and framework from sector ministries. The external aspect will involve the government, AACA, taking the lead and reaching consensus with the donor community on the framework so sector interventions will be coordinated and support identified priorities. It is expected that the consensus on the programming aspects of the development framework will be less problematic as this report and the appendices cover the substantive issues in detail. 166. The past 20 years of activity in the sector have been dominated by NGOs and a small number of UN agencies, especially FAO. Most of the actual work has been done by a cadre of Afghan nationals, many of them based in Pakistan with relatively limited resources. With the enormous expansion in support, the resources available exceeds absorptive capacity and may well exacerbate social tensions. In these circumstances a new institutional order is essential. A new equilibrium incorporating the private sector, line ministries, rural communities, NGOs and international agencies must be found. 167. There is a significant gap between the public sector role as articulated by the AIA in the NDF and the views of many senior members of the line ministries. There is a critical need for a short-term strategy to bridge this gap, and the Government has initiated the concept of Planning and Implementation Groups in each ministry to create a greater awareness of the need for change. Once the Transitional Government is established, a review of public sector administration is planned. Civil Service Commission is expected to recommend wide ranging changes in both the overall composition of sector agencies and their individual structures. This is an area of reform where the international community has high expectations following the statements of the AIA and contents of the NDF. It will have major implications at the sector level. 168. Non-government agencies are established as vital elements in the delivery of a wide range of services to the village and district levels. The established NGOs have professional staff, mostly Afghan nationals, who have acquired skills working with village communities. The challenge is to ensure that these skills remain available whilst adjusting the role of the NGOs to the existence of functioning line ministries, who will have overall responsibility for monitoring their activities. To date, line ministry personnel at the provincial and district levels have not been provided with clear responsibilities consistent with the new vision of the public sector, and are also hindered by their lack of facilities and budgets. However, it is important that the process of adjustment begins early in the recovery to establish de facto roles, and to ensure line ministry staff realize that their new role will include working with NGOs who have been delivering key services for many years. In discussions with the mission, NGOs indicated they have already begun to adjust their programs to draw ministry staff more closely into their activities. However, clearer policies and operational guidelines are required especially at the provincial and district levels, would be helpful. 169. The need will be to create a framework within which communities can play their envisaged role and interact with district and provincial agencies using participatory methods. In doing so, careful consideration will have to be given to the adjustments needed to existing relationships between communities and NGOs who may have been working together for several years and to the relationship between empowered communities and line ministry staff. At a very early stage there will be a need to formulate a ""blueprint"" which defines, at least in broad terms, these evolving relationships, so that all concerned have a clear understanding of their responsibilities and functions. 44   Draft Report  170. Afghanistan is receiving unprecedented attention and offers of assistance from the international community. To ensure that resources are used efficiently and effectively, it is essential that efficient aid coordination and management mechanisms be established. The mission noted that various coordination mechanisms are in place, but is concerned that, at least in the natural resources sector, the coordination to date is not being led by the Afghan authorities, especially the AACA. To ensure Government ownership, and that activities are supporting government priorities, and to minimize the risk of duplication within the major donor programs it is essential to have a process established with regular donor meetings chaired by the government, and its representative body. It is envisaged that such meetings should be held and decisions taken within an agreed development framework, such as the one proposed in this report.  45   AFGHANISTAN NATURAL RESOURCES AND AGRICULTURE SECTOR  APPENDIX 1 SHORT TERM INTERVENTIONS AND PROJECT PROFILES   Appendix 1 page 2 I. INTRODUCTION  1. The sector development framework prepared as part of the needs assessment represents the key elements of the recovery process that will be required over the next five years. It identifies the priority short-term interventions that will provide the basis for the mediumterm development. While these are the priority interventions, it is essential to recognise that during the period of conflict development activities and programs were ongoing, and that any planning of sector or sub-sector programs, and short-term activities need to incorporate these existing ongoing activities. The difficulty is the absence of an integrated database outlining the scale and scope of these existing projects. 2. As part of the short-term planning process, opportunities may exist to build on or integrate existing programs into the framework. With other activities, due to revised polices or the rejuvenation of core public sector roles it may be necessary to devise a road map to move from the current situation to one that conforms to the medium term framework. This will be necessary for a number of programs that involve moving from an emergency dependency approach to recovery and self-reliance. Also, it will be necessary to initiate activities, which have remained dormant for several years. In terms of developing the short-term interventions and programs it is essential that the development partners coordinate their activities within a government endorsed sector development framework. II. A. SHORT TERM INTERVENTIONS  Short term Intervention Program Categories  3. The short-term interventions that are required over the next two years have been classified into the following five categories: (i) Rural Livelihood Program; (ii) Community Development Program; (iii) Preparatory Sector Investment Program; (iv) Institutional Reform and Capacity Building; (v) Planning and Policy Formulation. 4. Rural Livelihood Program. The Rural Livelihood or National Solidarity Program is the Government initiated program to provide short-term employment and income for the rural population who have last assets and livelihoods through the drought and conflict. The program is designed to facilitate national unity and re-establish through a quick disbursing intervention the legitimacy of central government. The program is essentially a national program for asset replacement and is targeted at each district in the country. Within each district, a program of infrastructure rehabilitation will be undertaken, which will provide shortterm employment for those most in need who include the landless, sharecroppers, the unemployed, displaced persons and returning refugees. 5. Community Development Program. This will be a core program in the recovery and rehabilitation strategy. The program will encompass community development and community investment based activities. It is expected to include the following: community empowerment, organisation, planning and decision making processes, identifying effective community development models, and relationships with government agencies; and investment activities in community infrastructure and rehabilitation. The program will be started on a pilot basis over the first two years, with the models to be developed by identifying and implementing agreed community priorities. The micro-watershed and its natural resources base to form the physical   Appendix 1 page 3 parameters for the targeted area. Actual activities could include, rehabilitation or building of water storage and small-scale irrigation infrastructure, micro-watershed planning, reestablishing fodder and agro-forestry production, livestock (poultry and ruminant) establishing off-farm small enterprises and related training courses. The program will require substantial countrywide investment and effective coordination. 6. Preparatory Sector Investment Program. To develop the framework key studies and field investigations will be required in areas such as: horticulture; livestock systems; forest and rangeland; watershed management and rural finance to identify and prioritize viable agricultural commodities with opportunities for industry development, and feasible interventions. Feasibility studies will be undertaken to appraise and prioritize the large-scale formal schemes for rehabilitation. These detailed studies will be important as a precursor to substantial investment decisions and plans. 7. Institutional Reform and Capacity Building. The National Development Framework emphasizes the AIA commitment to establishing an efficient institutional framework in the sector, which will involve small streamlined government institutions providing the appropriate policy and regulatory environment for community driven development, based on private sector growth and delivery of services. This will require a comprehensive review and assessment of the existing institutions, with a functional and institutional analysis to prepare and formulate a reorganization plan for the sector institutions. Capacity building and training will be required, and as a first step support for the establishment and operation of the Planning and Implementation Groups in each of the three Ministries and in some selected provincial offices 8. Planning and Policy Formulation. A number of key priority studies will be required to support the formulation of a sound strategic and policy framework in the natural resource and agriculture sector. The studies will involve establishing databases and information systems to support the planning process, and establishing a dedicated natural resource policy unit which would be responsible for developing harmonized sector policies, legislation and regulatory requirements. B. Existing and Planning Interventions  9. Through the long period of conflict NGOs and a number of UN agencies, in particular FAO, have with their own funds and bilateral donor support undertaken project activities in the sector. The range of the rehabilitation activities and interventions is broad, encompassing seed multiplication, fertilizer supply, pest control programs, livestock and animal disease control, food security, community development and rural rehabilitation, including traditional small scale systems, and community capacity building at the local level. While the area focus of these activities can be determined, the impact and effectiveness of a number of these interventions is difficult to assess in the absence of monitoring and evaluation reports. 10. With the rapid expansion in support from the international community since late 2001, it is important that these lessons learned are incorporated when planning future activities and interventions. As part of this needs assessment an indicative inventory of short-term development partner support to the natural resource and agriculture sector was prepared. This inventory is outlined in terms of crop production, livestock and animal health, food security and rural rehabilitation, water resources, institutional capacity and strengthening, and is also presented in terms of development partner commitments. The data is from a variety of sources and while not complete, and be treated as an indicative outline, it provides a very useful   Appendix 1 page 4 summary of ongoing and planned development partner activities at a sub-sector level, as of April 2002. The indicative sector inventory is presented in Annex 1, Table 1. 11. The inventory indicates that there are large levels of support, and in which sub-sectors there is currently limited support and commitments, such as for policy and planning, and institutional capacity and strengthening activities. A review of the activities indicates the key role NGOs and FAO have played in supporting the sector, and the potential large increase in sector activities given the planned funding commitments. The AIMS NGO database indicates that over twenty NGOs are involved in over one hundred and twenty ongoing or planned rehabilitation projects. These activities with a budget (estimated for 2 years) of approximately $49 million, and when a number of other large NGO projects are included, it totals approximately $55 million. Since the start of 2002 FAO has received a significant increase in its budget support, with a large number of bilateral donors providing funds through FAO, and its indicative budget for activities in the sector is $40 to $50 million. The EU and USAID have large funding commitments, as does DFID for poppy eradication, AKDN, and the multi-lateral banks (ADB, WB) who are also planning large programs. 12. While the sector development framework prepared as part of the needs assessment, identifies priority short-term interventions required to provide the basis for the medium-term development, the development partner inventory, provides an indicative outline of ongoing and planned shortterm activities. A cross-check or comparison between the framework and inventory activities indicates where there are potential gaps or lack of support for priority shortterm activities. This comparison is summarized in Table 1, with recommended short-term interventions, current ongoing, planned and proposed interventions (based on Annex 1, Table 1) and an assessment of potential shortfalls. In terms of the five categories used for the short-term interventions, shortfalls exist in all five categories, and in particular with institutional reform and capacity building, planning and policy, and preparatory studies for sector investment programming. In preparing proposals for priority short-term interventions, ensuring that these shortfalls are addressed is of primary importance, and the short-term interventions outlined below cover these areas. 13. Further, the number of development partners, the planned level of support, and potential for overlapping activities, emphasizes the critical importance that the government have a development framework for the sector, and that government lead in the coordination of donor activities in the sector.   Appendix 1 page 5 Table 1: Agriculture and Natural Resource Sector Short Term Interventions Recommended Short-term Interventions 1.

Rural Livelihood Improvement a. Background and Rationale  15. The Rural Livelihood or National Solidarity Program is the Government initiated program to provide short-term employment and income for the rural population who have last assets and livelihoods through the drought and conflict. The program is designed to facilitate national unity and re-establish through a quick disbursing intervention the legitimacy of central government. The program is essentially a national program for asset replacement and is targeted at each district in the country. Within each district, a program of infrastructure rehabilitation will be undertaken, which will provide shortterm employment for those most in need who include the landless, sharecroppers, the unemployed, displaced persons and returning refugees. b. Objective  16. To provide immediate short-term employment and income for rural households through employment in community rehabilitation activities. These activities to be supported by government and undertaken on a national basis. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  17. This program is intended to finance quick disbursing activities within a 1-year timeframe. The aim is to repair or rehabilitate public or community (district) level infrastructure using local labour, particularly those families in need of cash income over the next six months. The activities to be included could cover rural road repairs, repairs to secondary and primary irrigation canals, repairs to community buildings such as schools and clinics, tree planting in urban areas and clearing of destroyed buildings including the reclamation and sale of bricks. Possible activities mentioned in the sub-sector matrices include: (i) repairs to irrigation system structures; repairs to water harvesting structures; social forestry, and urban tree planting. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  18. The program will be implemented under the supervision of the AACA who will also provide central procurement and monitoring facilities. The lead agency will be the Ministry of Public Works in collaboration with the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development. e. Inputs and Indicative Costs  19. It is estimated that on average each district will receive about $130,000-$150,000 which will provide about 85,000-100,000 days of employment during 2002. The total fund required is about $45 million, of which the World Bank has committed $22 million. Approximately 40 percent of all rural families or about 6.5 million people are living in extreme poverty. After allowing for the elderly and children this leaves about 3 million working adults who would receive approximately $15 each. It is likely that this would be the only cash available to most of these families until next spring.   Appendix 1 page 9 2. Community Development Program a. Background and Rationale  20. This will be a core program in the recovery and rehabilitation strategy. The program will encompass community development and community investment based activities. It is expected to include the following: community empowerment, organisation, planning and decision making processes, identifying effective community development models, and relationships with government agencies; and investment activities in community infrastructure and rehabilitation, and in supporting services. The program will be started on a pilot basis over the first two years, with the models to be developed by identifying and implementing agreed community priorities. The micro-watershed and its natural resources base to form the physical parameter for the targeted area. Actual activities could include: rehabilitation or building of water storage and small-scale irrigation infrastructure, micro-watershed planning; re-establishing fodder and agroforestry production; livestock (poultry and ruminant); establishing off-farm small enterprises; and related training courses. The program will require a substantial countrywide investment, and to be successfully implemented effective coordination. b. Objective  21. To improve livelihoods for all stakeholders in the rural community through community based activities and sustainable use of resources. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  22. The community development program will, eventually, be a nationwide program and the foundation of the rehabilitation process, with communities determining their development priorities. The program will have several elements, combining institutional strengthening with investment in community infrastructure. Over time the program will cover every micro-watershed in the country and all communities will be drawn into the planning process. 23. In the short term, pilot activities will be undertaken to develop, assess and test community empowerment approaches and the community's ability to contribute to microwatershed planning. In developing a planning model that is suitable for most communities in Afghanistan it will be essential to build upon the experience of NGOs who have been working in this area. Initially the program would be implemented in a limited number of provinces that lie within the Government's ten priority regions (up to about nine provinces but fewer if provincial capacity is particularly low), and where some capacity exists in the provincial offices of the MRRD. 24. A first step will be to establish the Planning and Implementation Groups in MRRD and a similar but smaller cell in each of the selected provinces. This provincial implementation group would be a part of the MRRD provincial office. The Provincial office would be physically restored and rehabilitated including the provision of equipment and transport, but the staffing would be kept small until the Government has decided on the specific roles and functions of these offices and their relation to both the central Ministry and the Provincial Administration. 25. priorit likely much It is envisaged that the rehabilitation of water delivery infrastructure will be the key y of most communities. As a consequence, individual community development plans are to be dominated by small scale irrigation rehabilitation in the early years but will become broader once a stable water supply has been achieved. A number of modules or   Appendix 1 page 10 components will be developed for other livelihood activities, which are likely to include: rehabilitation or building of water storage and small-scale irrigation infrastructure; microwatershed planning; re-establishing fodder and agro-forestry production; activities to improve smallholder livestock productivity which may encompass fodder production, artificial insemination, vaccination and disease control and animal health and livestock support services; establishing off-farm small enterprises and related training courses. Additional support for the small-holder sector should target poultry producers with expanded village poultry distribution, and improved production capability for semi-commercial producers including improved disease control, deworming and supplementary feeding for female breeding stock. 26. Where communities are dependent on more formal and larger irrigation schemes then the rehabilitation timeframe will be longer, and short-term activities will be focused on technical and environmental assessments as well as the more complex institutional issue of system management transfer. d. 27. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  The program will be implemented by the MRDD.  28. The capacity of the Provincial Office/ Group to implement the program could be expanded by contracting with NGOs, consulting firms, or the hiring of short-term consultants (according to well defined TORs and staff selection criteria). Actual construction works would also be contracted with qualified construction companies as indicated in the draft National Development Framework. e. Inputs and Indicative Costs  29. It is expected that the first two years will establish the program and the development process. The indicative budget is $150 to 200 million.   Appendix 1 page 11 3. Preparatory Sector Investment Program  30. The AIA in the National Development Framework has committed itself to building an efficient framework for recovery, growth, and poverty reduction. A sound strategic framework, underpinned by clear, consistent, and well articulated sector policies, will be crucial at the outset to set the stage for quick recovery and sustainable long-run development. Achieving this will require the establishment of data support systems for the analysis and monitoring of development programs, and formal and on-the-job training to upgrade the skills of key personnel in the ministries responsible for agriculture, natural resources, and rural development. 31. To develop this framework key studies and field investigations will be required in areas such as: horticulture; livestock systems; forest and rangeland; watershed management and rural finance; to identify and prioritize viable agricultural commodities with opportunities for industry development, and feasible interventions. Feasibility studies will be undertaken to appraise and prioritize the large-scale formal schemes for rehabilitation. These studies will be important as a precursor to major investment decisions.   Appendix 1 page 12 3.1 Feasibility Studies and Preparatory Planning for Large and Formal Irrigation Scheme Rehabilitation. a. Background and Rationale  32. The country has over 300,000 ha of formal and large-scale irrigation schemes, which require rehabilitation. The schemes are State owned and the responsibility of MIWR. Many of the formal schemes were financed in part by International Financial Institutions (WB, ADB), and/or by bilateral donors. A number of these schemes currently have major problems in terms of salinity, waterlogging, infrastructure requirements, management and community ownership and participation. A project-by-project approach to rehabilitation should be avoided, and a program approach adopted to ensure that overall priorities and sequencing results in timely, maximized, cost-effective and sustainable impact. b. Objective  33. To undertake detailed feasibility studies on the formal and large scale irrigation systems, and based on strict selection criteria, prioritise the schemes for rehabilitation. A program approach will be used to prepare the rehabilitation investment plan. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  34. This study would undertake a systematic technical, economic, social and environmental assessment of formal state owned irrigation schemes as well as the very large schemes found in the northern and western regions of Afghanistan, and support implementation of a prioritized and sequenced program of investment projects. The program would undertake systematic assessment of all schemes, establish priorities for project preparation activities including feasibility studies, social mobilization and participation of beneficiaries, and environmental assessment, complete all studies and related activities, and manage individual project financing and implementation. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  35. The Government will need to allocate sufficient funding to establish a well trained team within MIWR working closely with the MIWR Planning and Implementation Group to ensure timely completion of all assessments and feasibility studies, the setting of priorities and formulation of project packages, completion of designs and tender documents. The follow-on medium term investment program would involve the monitoring and supervision of construction and implementation (relying on out-sourcing to other development partners, particularly the private sector as much as possible). e. Indicative Inputs and Cost  36. The program team will be multi-disciplinary since the assessments and feasibility studies will cover not only the technical or engineering aspects of project rehabilitation, but also the economic, social and environmental aspects, and involve extensive social mobilization and farmer organization to restructure the roles of the state and the farmer in these projects. International and domestic consultants will be required to assist in establishing the process, the selection criteria and undertaking the feasibility studies. An indicative cost is $ 4 million.   Appendix 1 page 13 3.2 Rural Finance a. Background and Rationale  37. In the agricultural sector access to rural finance is a priority need. Farmers either recovering from drought or returning to their lands after fleeing conflict, need to finance the reconstruction of irrigation systems, land preparation, seeds, fertilizers, horticulture planting stock, agricultural equipment and new livestock purchases. 38. Currently the only finance available in the rural areas is being provided either through moneylenders or by NGOs, several of which have microfinance programs. Given the diverse nature of the NGOs, their programs and the areas and sectors in which they concentrate their activities, it is likely that while some finance is being provided for small scale activities, most people do not have any access at all to credit or finance. This is certainly the situation for individuals looking for finance for larger investments such as the reestablishment of orchards, the purchase of agricultural equipment or the establishment of commercial livestock production. At present, the Agriculture Bank is essentially insolvent, has no stocks of inputs or equipment, and is doing no lending whatsoever. Reportedly, the Bank still has 500 staff, of which 300 are based in Kabul and the remainder are at the 5-6 provincial offices that have managed to remain open during the last decade. b. Objective  39. To assess rural finance needs, and to identify and prepare appropriate rural financial framework (policy, regulatory and institutional) required to establish viable bank and non-bank financial institutions that will effectively meet rural household needs for asset and community based lending. c. 40. Scope and Proposed Activities  The study team will: (i) Review the financial and banking sector policy, legislative and regulatory framework that governs the operations of commercial banks, including the prudential guidelines of the national bank. (ii) Undertake an option analysis on alternatives for asset and community based lending; (iii) Prepare recommendations on the framework for rural finance institutions and delivery systems; (iv) Prepare an action plan to establish a functioning rural finance system that can be operating within two years; (v) Assess the opportunities for external financial partners, and requirements for foreign banks to establish in Afghanistan. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  41. The study team will work under the general supervision of a Steering Group chaired by the Ministry of Finance. It is expected that the first stage of the work will take about 9 months. Counterparts should be sourced from existing bank and non bank financial institutions.   Appendix 1 page 14 e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  42. A team of international and national consultants will undertake the study based on terms of reference agreed with the Ministry of Finance. An indicative costing of the study is $0.6 million.   Appendix 1 page 15 3.3 Feasibility Study Commercial Development of the Dairy and Meat Industries a. Background and Rationale  43. Afghanistan has the capacity to produce dairy and meat products is excess of domestic demands, and the opportunities for export marketing need to be assessed. The two major industries in the livestock sub-sector represent important potential commercial outlets for the country's rangeland resources. b. Objective  44. To determine the prospects of the dairy and meat industries, and investment requirements for commercial development of these industries. c. 45. (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi) Scope and Proposed Activities  The study will: Review the status of existing facilities, and assess the conditions needed to create sustainable export markets; Assess livestock production systems, including breeding policies; Assess abattoir facilities and meat inspection systems, public hygiene regulations, animal disease controls; Trade regulations and incentives for private investment; Undertake market analysis, identifying market prospects and export opportunities, requirements to enable Afghanistan to enter selected export markets for meat; Prepare an investment plan for the industries. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  46. The study team will work under the supervision of a Steering Group chaired by the Ministry of Finance. This committee will include representatives of the MAAH, Ministry of Industry, MIWR, and Ministry of Trade. It is expected that the study would take about six months. e. 47. Indicative Inputs and Costs  The indicative costs to undertake the study are $0.6 million.   Appendix 1 page 16 3.4 3.4.1 Feasibility Studies Cotton and Sugar Beet Industries Cotton Industry a. Background and Rationale  48. The cotton industry was an important industry in Afghanistan during the 1970s, with a production area of more than 170,000 ha. The 1997 FAO Survey indicated a cotton area of 112,000 ha. Processing facilities operated in at least three major centres, including Kandahar, Kunduz and Heart. A study is required to assess if the potential exists for a viable cotton production and processing industry. Such as industry could provide thousands of jobs in downstream textile industries. b. Objective  49. To determine the feasibility and commercial viability of re-establishing a cotton industry in Afghanistan. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  50. An assessment is needed on the status of the industry, industry production and processing feasibility, an inventory on existing processing facilities, and assessment of the potential and requirements for a viable cotton industry. The outcome of the study will be a set of recommendations on the prospects for redeveloping the cotton industry and, if positive, a framework outlining the scale, including possible downstream processing, and investment needs. This would provide a framework for private sector investors. One aspect of the study will cover the process to privatise those facilities which were formerly operated as state enterprises. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  51. The study team will work under the supervision of a Steering Group chaired by the Ministry of Finance. This committee will include representatives of the MAAH, Ministry of Industry, MIWR, and Ministry of Trade. It is expected that the study would take about 6 months to complete. e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  52. It is proposed that a two phase approach be adopted, phase 1 with a small prefeasibility study and based on the outcome of that study, a decision would be made on moving to a phase 2 which would be a full feasibility study. The study will require the services of international and national consultants for a period of about six months. The indicative cost of undertaking the study is $0.6 million.   Appendix 1 page 17 3.4.2 Sugarbeet Industry a. Background and Rationale  53. Previously sugarbeet was an established industry in Afghanistan, and currently is in a similar situation to the cotton industry. According the FAO 1997 survey sugarbeet area in 1997 had declined to only 2,000 ha. While it does not have the same potential economic importance, it does represent a potential cash crop for farmers, and a possible import substitution product. The viability of sugarbeet production and processing needs to be assessed. Also need to assess and analyze the conditions required for the industry to be viable. b. Objective  54. To determine the feasibility and commercial viability of re-establishing a sugarbeet industry in Afghanistan. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  55. An assessment is needed on the status of the industry, industry production and processing feasibility, an inventory on existing processing facilities, and assessment of the potential and requirements for a viable sugarbeet industry. The outcome of the study will be a set of recommendations on the prospects for re-establishing the cotton industry. If these recommendations are positive, a framework to be developed outlining the scale, including possible downstream processing, and investment needs. This would provide a framework for private sector investors. One aspect of the study will cover the process to privatise any facilities, which remain and were formerly operated as state enterprises. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  56. The study team will work under the supervision of a Steering Group chaired by the Ministry of Finance. This committee will include representatives of the MAAH, Ministry of Industry, MIWR, and Ministry of Trade. It is expected that the study would take about 6 months to complete. e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  57. It is proposed that a two phase approach be adopted, phase 1 with a small prefeasibility study and based on the outcome of that study, a decision would be made on moving to a phase 2 which would be a full feasibility study. The study will require the services of international and national consultants for a period of about six months. The indicative cost of undertaking the study is $0.5 million.   Appendix 1 page 18 3.5 Horticulture and Innovative Crop Industry and Export Market Feasibility Studies a. Background and Rationale  58. Horticulture production was previously a significant agriculture activity in Afghanistan and accounted for 40 percent of export earnings. The 1997 FAO Survey indicated an orchard area of 140,000 ha, though more recent information is that the area has reduced to 70,000 ha. 59. An assessment of the domestic industry and markets is required to guide those planning to reinvest in the horticulture production and processing business in Afghanistan. The markets have changed while Afghanistan has reduced production, and other countries have entered the export market. A key requirement is for Afghan producers and traders to understand current opportunities with the horticultural produce markets in different parts of the world. Afghan suppliers will need to re-establish trade contacts and maintain regular contact with trade associations. Particular attention should be given to the possibility of introducing one or more high value crops to poppy growing areas. b. Objective  60. To assess the viability of horticulture and innovative crop enterprises and industries, in particular those that have the prospect or potential for export markets. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  61. The marketing studies to provide an assessment of the prospects for: (i) horticulture produce, nuts and dried fruit; and (ii) innovative crops providing raw materials to pharmaceutical, nutrition/health and essential oils industries. The market studies will be business orientated with concrete recommendations linking potential export partners to Afghan suppliers. The market assessment, will involve study visits to selected potential export markets. Specific contacts will be made available through an Afghan trade association, which, if not currently functioning, will be established and assisted under the study. 62. The studies will prepare be a detailed analysis of commodity feasibility, and viability of the industry in both domestic and export markets. It will detail export market specifications and trade regulations leading to an assessment of the most likely openings for Afghan produce, both geographically and in terms of commodities. An investment program will be prepared for those commodities, which are viable. With the innovative crop study an action plan for initial piloting with identified market outlets will need to be prepared. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  63. It is proposed that the study team comprise two international trade experts and five national experts including representatives from the ministries of trade and agriculture. In addition, the national group should include representatives from the private sector especially prominent businessmen with interest in the horticulture trade. The study team should report their findings within six months.   Appendix 1 page 19 e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  64. The indicative costs of the proposed studies, which will require inputs from international and national consultants, are horticulture $0.6 million and innovative crop $0.4 million.   Appendix 1 page 20 4. Institutional Reform and Capacity Building a. Background and Rationale  65. Over the last two decades the capacity of the public institutions responsible for agriculture, water and natural resources, and rural development in Afghanistan has declined significantly, in terms of both physical and human resources. These institutions, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources, and Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development have lacked the capacity to undertake their functions and responsibilities, with a number of the key services being provided by non government organizations (NGOs) and community based organizations. During this period the institutions were not exposed to change or to international best practices in public sector management. The draft National Development Framework emphasizes the AIA commitment to establishing an efficient institutional framework in the sector, which will involve small streamlined government institutions providing the appropriate policy and regulatory environment for community driven development, based on private sector growth and delivery of services. 66. The AIA has indicated that the critical first step in this institutional reform process will be the establishment of Planning and Implementation Groups in the Ministries and their provincial offices to facilitate the management change and re-organization. These Planning and Implementation Groups will be an integral part of the Ministry organizational structure and internal operations, and will be responsible for building management capacity and skills. Establishment and effective operation of the Groups will require technical support, formal and on the job training for key personnel. The second step in the reform process will be a comprehensive review and assessment of the existing institutions, with a functional and institutional analysis to prepare and formulate a re-organization plan for the sector institutions. 67. This assessment and re-organization will be participatory, and is required to establish efficient public sector institutions with appropriate structures and functions for the new operating environment. While the overall process of institutional reform will be guided by the Civil Service Commission, which has been appointed by AIA to undertake this task, the more detailed institutional analysis of individual ministries and their organisation at a sector level will be undertaken as a discrete exercise using terms of reference agreed with the Civil Service Commission. b. Objectives the establishment and capacity building of the Planning and in each of the three Ministries and in selected provincial offices to for change management, and for efficient program and project develop an efficient and effective public sector institutional framework and natural resource sector.  68. To: (i) support Implementation Groups provide a framework management; and (ii) to for the agriculture, water c. 69.  Scope and Proposed Activities  Activities will include: (i) support for the establishment and operation of the Planning and Implementation Groups in each of the three Ministries and in some selected provincial offices; (ii) capacity building and training of Ministry and provincial staff in the Planning and Implementation Groups, in identified priority technical and management areas;   Appendix 1 page 21 (iii) (iv) (v) sector institutional and organizational analysis and assessment, which will involve active consultation and participation of all key stakeholders in the sector; support for the formulation of a reorganization plan for sector public institutions, in line with the private sector-led and community-based principles of the AIA draft National Development Framework; preparation of an time based action plan for implementation of the reorganization, with detailed recommendations on physical and human resource requirements and costings, for the follow-on assistance and technical support. Training and capacity building will be a major activities in follow-on support. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  70. The executing agency will be the Ministry of Finance, and they will chair a Steering Committee comprised of Deputy Ministers of Irrigation and Water Resources, and Rehabilitation and Rural Development, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, and senior staff of selected provincial agencies. The Civil Service Commission should also be a member of the committee. The AACA could possibly act as the implementing agency for activities and facilitate the activity implementation with the respective institutional mandates. Within the ministries, activities will focus on the Planning and Implementation Groups that are to be established in accord with the draft National Development Framework. Technical committees and working groups will be established at all levels to ensure coordination. e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  71. To start in Quarter 3, 2002 and will be implemented initially over a two year period. Indicatively, it will require international and domestic consultants. Core skills will be needed in institutional/ change management, and short-term skills are expected to include, but not be limited to: (i) human resource and training; (ii) change management; (iii) economist; (iv) financial management; (v) rural development; (vi) program management; and (vi) workshop facilitators. The short-term specialists will be recruited on an as-needed basis which will allow the flexibility to respond to both the Government's evolving needs. Indicative costs for the two years have been outlined as: institutional review and reform $1.2 million; Planning and Implemention Group establishment and operation $5 million; and capacity building and training activities $5 million. These costs are very preliminary estimates. 4.1 Sub-Sector Institutional Reform  72. As part of the overall sector institutional reform there will need to be a number of key sub-sector studies to assess the appropriate roles, structure and functions required to efficiently and effectively deliver services in key technical areas such as: water resources, livestock and animal husbandry, ARATTS, plant and disease control, certification systems, and extension service delivery. Once the overall framework for the institutional review is decided these studies could be undertaken in as part of the review, or in parallel and would provide key inputs into the planning for reorganized and restructured institutions. The studies outlined below, provide an indication of the type of studies required. 4.1.1 Agriculture Research and Technology Transfer System (ARATTS)  73. In the past, prior to the conflict, the agricultural research and technology transfer system was substantial, though not always focused on the real needs of the Afghan farmer. This system is no longer functioning and there has been widespread destruction of the infrastructure and   Appendix 1 page 22 loss of skilled human resources. The ARATTS network has an important role to play in ensuring that Afghanistan has access to the most appropriate technology to enable the agriculture sector to maximize its performance. It is an essential requirement that a review be undertaken to assess the needs, policy, functions and institutional structure to establish and operate an efficient ARATTS, that will respond to farmer identified priorities and to future farming needs. This assessment to be undertaken as part of the larger MAAH institutional review. The principles underlying the future shape of ARATTS will include; (i) (ii) (iii) Integrating onfarm participatory research and technology transfer activities into practical development programs; Development of demand-driven, community-based research and technology transfer programs that recognize the special needs of rural poor, especially the disabled, children, and rural women; Adoption of innovative methodological approaches, which utilize the farming systems approach to research and development, integrated natural resource research sites, integrated watershed management, and incorporate socioeconomic aspects with technical and biophysical research programs; and Determining the most effective institutional framework for linking research with extension delivery agencies and organisations.  (iv)  74. Based on a very strong consultative and participatory process involving all stakeholders, the study team to review, assess and prepare recommendations on establishing an ARATTS that will be farmer focused, and respond to priority needs in terms of developing an applied research program, and will be adequately resourced and financed. In preparing the institutional structure, options in terms of delivery services, in particular technology transfer and extension delivery systems need to be assessed to determine the most cost effective systems. The study would detail the physical and human resources required to implement the recommended option. 4.1.2 Livestock and Other Institutional Studies  75. Livestock studies will be required as part of the institutional review to determine the most effective and efficient systems for livestock vaccination production and delivery, and for provision of animal health and livestock support services. A vaccine quality control laboratory is likely to required, and it will be necessary to define sentinel service needs against transboundary diseases, diagnostic laboratory functions and needs, and to identify the requirements for functioning animal health laboratories. The outcome from these studies will determine infrastructure and equipment support, human resources and training need requirements. Similar issues and studies will need to be addressed in the other sub-sector areas such as forestry and rangeland, plant disease and control systems, and water resources.   Appendix 1 page 23 5. Planning and Policy Formulation a. Introduction  76. In Afghanistan the policy and planning framework in the sector has been neglected during the long period of conflict. For more than two decades, Afghanistan's policy makers and planners have been isolated from progress in international best practices in most areas of development. The AIA has committed itself to building a modern, efficient institutional framework for community based recovery, growth, and poverty reduction in the draft National Development Framework. 77. Currently much of the information relating to the availability of natural resources, productivity and agriculture sector output is either out of date or fragmented. More accurate information is required in several sub-sectors to provide an adequate basis for policy and investment decisions. This process must be set in a framework, which involves the establishment of a comprehensive national statistical agency using standard protocols. 78. A sound strategic framework, underpinned by clear, consistent, and well articulated sector policies, will be crucial at the outset to set the stage for quick recovery and sustainable long-run development in the sector. Achieving this will require the establishment of data support systems for policy formulation and planning, and for the analysis and monitoring of development programs. The policy requirements in the short term will be significant for an efficient framework to be developed in natural resource and water resource management, rangelands, forestry, livestock, community development, and ARATTS. 79. A number of key priority studies will be undertaken to support the formulation of a sound strategic and policy framework in the natural resource and agriculture sector. The studies are outlined in this section and will involve establishing databases and information systems to support the planning process. While five studies are outlined, more may be required additional studies may be required as the work progresses. A dedicated natural resource policy unit is proposed (refer section 5.6), which would be responsible for development of harmonized sector policies, legislation and regulatory requirements.   Appendix 1 page 24 5.1 Water Resources Assessment a. Background and Rationale  80. Water resources in Afghanistan are limited, and must be managed efficiently. Currently opportunities exist to improve water planning, use and management efficiency. Government needs to undertake a resource assessment to provide a national database and basis for developing policy on water use, groundwater development, watershed management, and water harvesting. This is required to ensure that any investment and rehabilitation water resources infrastructure, especially irrigation systems, which is planned in the medium term is based on sustainable water sources and use. In addition, groundwater availability is becoming a critical issue as groundwater levels fall. Farmers need to have access to forecasts on expected weather and water accumulation in winter snow pack when making enterprise decisions. Currently such information is not available. At the present time the information base does not allow an accurate assessment of the impact of: depletion of groundwater; inadequate snowfall; or investment in irrigation structures on the availability of water resources. b. Objective  81. To establish a water resource database information system that will provide the basis for efficient water planning and policy formulation. c. 82. Scope and Proposed Activities  The assessment will concentrate on: (i) Rebuilding the national knowledge base, using modern information management tools including GIS and remote sensing, and strengthening the monitoring system. The historical knowledge base of maps, reports and studies, and data is partly lost and partly scattered across the former Soviet Union. Every effort will be made to reassemble this database. (ii) Re-establishing the hydrologic and hydro-geologic network (including stations to monitor snowpack) is a high priority. This will involve a systematic review of the earlier network design, identification of the most appropriate technologies and systems for a cost effective network. The technical options to be assessed will include new technologies for solar powered remote monitoring stations, but especially new remote sensing technologies that have recently emerged. The network investment will be detailed, and a phased implementation plan will be prepared beginning with priority regions and river basins. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  83. This project will involve all the core natural resource ministries and agencies, and the Afghan Information Management System (AIMS). A steering committee will be established to oversee implementation. It is expected that the study could take up to two years to establish the comprehensive database. e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  84. The assessment will involve international and national consultants, and an indicative estimate is $1.5 million.   Appendix 1 page 25 5.2 Comprehensive Water Policy and Legislative Review a. Background and Rationale  85. Revision of the existing water policy and water law is required as the current policy and law do not meet sector requirements as outlined in the NDF. Such a revision must be based on a participatory consensus building process. In the present setting in which major changes in institutional arrangements, roles and responsibilities are contemplated in the NDF, it would be prudent to proceed gradually, addressing immediate policy needs while allowing the institutional change process to lead the policy and legislative review process. Clearly these two processes are to a significant degree intertwined. A feasible starting point would be to undertake an analysis of the present water policy and law given the future direction indicated in the draft NDF, and outline key areas of change, and the various options and recommended directions, and particularly the institutional and organizational implications. Such a policy note could be one of the key inputs to the change management process to be initiated in each of the core ministries. 86. There are certain provisions in the existing law that concern administrative procedures and authorities that are in direct conflict with the NDF and current instructions to the core ministries, for example provisions for financing rehabilitation of irrigation schemes by the Ministry of Water and Electricity and cost sharing by farmers through loans from the defunct Agriculture Development Bank. These and other provisions will probably have to be changed by the Transitional Government in the near term if disputes over what ministries are legally obligated to do, or how they are to function are to be avoided. It is likely that the policy and legislative framework will be adjusted in a phased manner, to ensure that the recovery and reconstruction program can proceed in a timely manner while a broader consensus is built in the sector about the future shape of water policy and new legislation. b. Objective  87. To undertake a comprehensive review of the existing water policy and water law as the first phase of the process of policy and legislative revision. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  88. The first phase will involve a review and analysis of the present water policy and law, particularly in relation to the draft NDF, and identification of key areas of change, an option analysis and recommendations on policy and legislative directions, and associated institutional and organizational implications. The study will also detail the required follow-on work that will be necessary to revise and reformulate water policy and legislation. The output from this study will also be used as a policy note in the change process. d. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  89. This project will involve a collaborative effort of all the core natural resource ministries and agencies, including AACA. A steering committee will be established to oversee implementation. e. 90. Indicative Inputs and Costs  Indicative costs for the initial study are $0.3 million.   Appendix 1 page 26 5.3 Livestock Assessment Survey a. Background and Rationale  91. Traditionally livestock activities have been an integral part of most farming systems in Afghanistan. Currently livestock raisers are faced with a number of serious problems involving loss of livestock, decreased productivity due to the declining feed and overgrazing, and the affects of animal diseases that have been inadequately treated. Livestock numbers have decreased significantly, estimates are that numbers are half those of ten years ago. There is an absence of reliable data on numbers, the production systems, and rangeland resource base, or any useful data on the performance of sheep and goats using rangelands or the influence of the conflict on the scale of nomadic flocks. Such data is essential for identifying feed resources for livestock, and estimating carrying capacity, and to properly plan animal health and disease control interventions. Establishing a database and monitoring system, and benchmarks for livestock numbers and the sustainable capacity of rangeland systems, which support livestock, is required. b. Objective  92. To undertake a livestock assessment to establish a database and monitoring system which will provide the basis for livestock planning and management of sustainable production systems. c. Scope and Proposed Activities which will provide the data for planning activities. It provinces, focusing on livestock numbers and livestock offtake strategies, and livestock support parts, one for the sedentary raisers and one for the  93. The livestock inventory assessment, will involve a rapid rural appraisal of all distribution, feed resources, husbandry and services. It will have to be done in at least 2 migratory kutchies.  94. The survey and the sampling technique will be professionally designed to ensure statistical validity. The survey will produce nation-wide data on livestock numbers and data with respect to age and sex categories and depending on final design, will permit other categories of information to be captured with respect to offtake and offtake strategies, production constraints and resources. The final data categories would be determined by the TA designer in consultation with animal production experts. The data will be analysed, presented in a summary report with key findings and recommendations for the sub-sector. Mechanisms to be identified for establishing this database and monitoring process in the appropriate agency, with procedures established for regular updating. The database will be made available for use by livestock planners of government departments, NGO and international agencies. d. 95. Implementation Arrangements and Timeframe  The study team will work under a Steering Committee chaired by MAAH. e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  96. The survey will rely heavily on staff of the Veterinary Field Units and contracted NGOs to conduct the interviews. They will be trained by the consultants and contracted for the work. To obtain some idea of the time needed, an indicative village sampling of 10% will make the 300   Appendix 1 page 27 VFU each responsible for ten or eleven villages. Three households per village and a day per village to sample them, suggests a sampling period per enumerator of about 2 weeks. The survey should be conducted as soon as possible and could be completed within 6 months. A consultant would be recruited for four months for survey design, the collation of data and a managing consultant would six months to conduct the training and manage the program overall. 97. Indicative costs for the assessment are $0.5 million.   Appendix 1 page 28 5.4 Village Level Assessment a. Background and Rationale  98. In Afghanistan the large number of individual communities (about 18,000) has traditionally had a keen interest in the use and protection of natural resources. Communal management, risk mitigation and coping strategies were a common feature of these traditional agricultural systems. Such community mechanisms have been weakened by years of conflict and a legacy of displaced people, widows and orphans, disabled and uneducated groups. To reestablish social cohesion, village/district level decision making structures must be rebuilt with appropriate policies and sensitive programs and projects. The NDF indicates that the basis of the recovery and rehabilitation program will be community based development. Currently limited reliable data is available on these local communities to assist in the planning process. 99. The planned investment in community development programs needs to be guided by a more comprehensive database of the conditions at the village/district level than is currently available. A village assessment is conducted by WFP on an annual basis using a sample of 1250 villages in 250 districts. This work needs to be built upon to provide a better basis for assessing village level conditions across the country. The WFP survey data requires more in depth analysis than has been possible, and further refinement of the questionnaire to enable additional data collection. In the medium term, the annual village survey should become an integral part of the sector information base. b. Objective  100. To undertake a village level assessment and prepare a comprehensive database on conditions at the village and district level, which will provide a quantitative base for community development planning and program investment activities. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  101. To assist WFP to refine their village level assessment questionnaire and undertake the necessary analysis to provide a clear assessment of the variations in (i) food security, (ii) access to raw materials and markets (iii) availability and concentration of assets, including land and livestock, (iv) water supply and irrigated area. Provide assistance for the collation and computerization of the completed questionnaires and the analysis and reporting of the results. 102. The survey will provide valuable data on the variation in the level and distribution of assets between villages across the country and between different ecological zones. The information will allow an assessment to be made of the degree of vulnerability of various segments of the population in each surveyed village and their respective districts. This assessment would allow the use of specific criteria to guide the design of subsequent community development program or project loans. d. Implementation Arrangement and Timeframe  103. The MRRD will be the executing agency, with the WFP the implementing agency under the general guidance of the UN and MRRD. The survey questionnaire is being prepared currently and will be fielded in July. It is expected that the results will be available in September 2002.   Appendix 1 page 29 e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  104. The required input will be one international expert in agricultural/ rural surveys including their computerised analysis plus two local staff to assist with the collation of the forms and presentation of the results. The international expert will be required for about 3 months plus a total of 10 months of local support staff. WFP currently fund the cost of the survey, including transport outside Kabul. An indicative cost of the proposed inputs is $0.16 million.   Appendix 1 page 30 5.5 Forest and Rangeland Assessment Inventory a. Background and Rationale  105. Afghanistan has a total land area of about 65 million ha. of which approximately 80 percent is either mountainous or desert, with forest cover small at around 1.3 million ha. or about 2 percent of the land area. Forest area has declined from 1.9 million ha. in 1996. In recent years forest cover has diminished, due to community demands for fuelwood and illegal logging. It is estimated that offtake rates are exceeding annual growth rates leaving a deficit of about 30,000 ha of forest per year. If nothing is done, Afghanistan will have very little natural forest or its associated wildlife left in 15 years time. Further, the increase in population, and the effects of drought and the conflict have resulted in degradation of the rangelands from overgrazing and a transfer of land into cultivation uses. No reliable inventory is available detailing the status of these resources, and is required to establish a sustainable forestry and rangeland planning and policy framework. b. Objective  106. To prepare a forest and rangeland inventory for effective sub-sector planning and policy development. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  107. The initial priority will be to determine the extent, status and condition of forestry and rangeland resources, and based on the inventory, detail recommendations and outline an action plan for the sustainable management of these resources. The methodology will be based on using satellite imagery or aerial photography, which will be supported by limited field truthing. Options on the type of management agreements needed at the local level to establish sustainable practices will be assessed. d. Implementation Arrangement and Timeframe  108. The study team will work under a Steering Committee chaired by MAAH. The study will be implemented over a one-year period. e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  109. International and national consultants, and funds for GIS data and some equipment will be required for the study, and the indicative cost is $0.8 million.   Appendix 1 page 31 5.6 Natural Resources Policy Unit a. Background and Rationale  110. The development framework details the need for a number of key policy reviews and for preparatory work on a policy reform agenda during the next two years. Specific sub-sectors where the policy framework needs review or amendment include but are not confined to: forestry; water resources; environmental protection; rural energy; rangeland grazing; rural cooperatives; agricultural trade; public and animal health; technology transfer; rural credit and community development. The policy requirements in the short to medium term will be significant for an efficient sector framework to be developed, which will enable improved livelihoods and sustainable resource management. 111. Currently each Ministry has a planning unit, and these units are poorly resourced and in recent years have not had an active policy role. An inherent risk given that a number of these units currently operate in the sector, and some have overlapping responsibilities is that the resulting policy development and legislation will not be harmonized across the sector. To minimize this risk, and establish a sector wide approach, which will ensure the development of policies, legislation, and regulations, which are uniform across the sub-sectors, the establishment of a dedicated natural resources policy unit is required. Such a unit would be responsible for undertaking this work. b. Objective  112. To establish an effective natural resource policy unit which can formulate a sound policy and regulatory framework for the sector. c. Scope and Proposed Activities  113. The policy requirements in the short term will be significant for an efficient framework to be developed in natural resource and water resource management, rangelands, forestry, livestock, community development, and ARATTS. The policies which need to be reviewed, and in some cases reformulated, include: forestry, water resources; environmental protection; rural energy; rangeland grazing; rural cooperatives; agricultural trade; public and animal health; technology transfer; rural credit and community development. The policy papers will be prepared. 114. While the requirements for each policy activity are not identified, and it proposed that a fund be established to provide the resources. So while key initial policy work is identified, there is flexibility for the follow-on work, based on priorities and needs. A key activity will be preparing the work program for this work. The assessment studies outlined in this section 5 (ie.5.1 to 5.5), focus on the establishment of data support systems for policy formulation and planning. These assessment studies will be critical inputs in the preparatory stages of the policy formulation. d. Implementation Arrangement and Timeframe  115. The study team will work with, and under the direction of the Natural Resources Policy Unit. This Unit to be established with an Afghan National Director, and it will report to a Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Finance. The Steering Committee will consist of   Appendix 1 page 32 representatives from all the ministries and agencies involved in the natural resource and agricultural sector. e. Indicative Inputs and Costs  116. International and national consultants will be required, in particular natural resource and agricultural policy economists. Short-term consultant inputs will be identified on a need basis for each discrete study. The indicative cost of implementing the policy work in this unit for two years is estimated at $2.2 million.   Appendix 1 page 33 Annex 1 Table 1: Development Partner Support to Natural Resource and Agriculture Sector Indicative Estimate (May 2002) Activity/ Project Short-Term 2002 Amoutt ($) (Indicative) Medium-Term Amount ($)  Sub-sector: Crop Production Seed Improvement -seed multiplication capacity building programs; -wheat seed procurement ; -improved planting materials On-going/ approved FAO(USAID/ EU/ ICARDA Ireland/ other bilaterals/ NGOs/ Norway).

BACKGROUND  1. Afghanistan is a landlocked country of some 65 million hectares and an estimated population of 20 million. It is characterized by a rugged mountainous landscape, large rangeland and desert areas, limited arable land, scarce water resources, and scattered human settlements (35,000 villages). ""Rainfall increases from west to east and vegetation ranges from desert in the south and west, to steppes and dry woodland in the center and north, to coniferous forests in the humid mountains along the Pakistan borders"".1 The prolonged war has massively accelerated already established negative trends in natural resource use, particularly deforestation, over-use of marginal agricultural and pastoral lands, and wildlife harvesting. 2. Although all environmental resources, including land, water, forests, pasture and rangelands, and energy, are interwoven within the larger agro-ecosystems which underpin rural livelihoods in Afghanistan, for the purpose of this particular sector needs assessment, it was agreed that natural resource management (NRM) would cover essentially agroforestry, forestry, and watershed management. Water resources and energy would be covered in separate sector notes. 3. Notwithstanding the narrow NRM focus described above, a number of key issues need further consideration and dialogue with GoA as part of the medium term development framework. Some of these issues are cross-cutting; others are more specific to NRM: (i) The need for implementation guidelines of the principles enunciated in the National Development Framework regarding the role of government, both at the national and local levels, and the implications of civil service reform; this is particularly important for the ministries of agriculture, irrigation, and rural development, and the department of forestry. The link between forest and energy policy, and the demand for timber. Decisions regarding how to halt the-still ongoing-massive deforestation and watershed degradation, need to be linked on the one hand to the country's energy policy (particularly in terms of development of gas, coal, and renewable energy, as well as impact on rural household fuelwood and timber consumption), and on the other hand, to the demand for timber which is expected to increase even further during the rehabilitation and reconstruction phase. Watersheds form the most logical platform for sound NRM and community based development in Afghanistan. Because the predominantly rural population is dependent on a natural resource based economy that provides a safety net for thousands of villages (and millions of people), and given the location and interdependence of key resources (especially, water, arable land, pasture, fuelwood, and fodder) within the confines of narrow valleys closely associated with the country's river system and water resources, improving rural livelihoods needs to be approached within a (micro) watershed framework, where water harvesting and watershed vegetative cover will play a critical role. The need for a comprehensive rural development focus.

May 1991.   Appendix 2 page 3 Afghanistan-including water management-need to be defined as an integral part of an overall Rural Development Strategy to reduce poverty and enhance the productivity and sustainability of the country's natural resource base. This implies that consideration be given concomitantly to the role of the non-farm economy in rural areas; (v) The fundamental and urgent role of management information systems (MIS). The scant availability of data and its quality2 is such that there is an urgent need to prepare a baseline of the country's resource base, using modern information technology (such as RM/GIS). MIS will play a key role not only in planning and monitoring resource management, but will also be instrumental in raising public awareness, and improving transparency and accountability of public institutions. The need to understand the social and political economy dimensions of natural resource management in Afghanistan. This is particularly crucial for understanding formal and informal tenure arrangements in the case of natural forest and pasture resources where power relations-at the local level (and what they imply in terms of rent seeking and rent capture)-have determined resource allocation and use rights over the past twenty years at least. Carving out a new role for public institutions would need to be anchored in the ""institutional reality at work on the ground."" II. A. SECTOR ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS  (vi)  A Seriously Threatened Natural Resource Base  4. Afghanistan is still a predominantly agrarian society with 80% of the population living in rural areas, and directly dependent on natural resources for livelihoods (small scale farming, pasture, and forest products). Despite massive migration to urban areas or outside the country (some 3-5 million people), the conflict over the past twenty years has led to the intensification of natural resource extraction, and particularly the acceleration of loss of natural forests through illegal logging, and the conversion of pasture lands for crop production. These processes have also contributed to increasing soil erosion, flooding, and water scarcity. The war itself directly contributed to massive degradation of farmland and pastures by landmines and through burning of forest and the destruction of the resource base of thousands of villages. 5. Because of the nature of topographic, vegetative cover, and climatic patterns,3 combined with unsustainable land use practices, particularly on steep slopes and the overuse of grasses, shrubs, and natural forests for fuelwood, it is estimated that as much 80% of the land in Afghanistan is subject to soil erosion. This includes vast rangeland areas. In certain parts of the country (especially in the west, southwest, north and center), these phenomena have led extreme forms of soil degradation (desertification) and the destruction of the sensitive mountain grassland ecosystem, impacting biomass productivity, and thus both livestock and wildlife populations.  2 3  Quite often, the most recent studies are based on data from old reports prepared either outside Afghanistan or based on little ground truthing. Two thirds of the country is covered by the arid, sparsely vegetated Hindu Kush mountainous ecosystem.   Appendix 2 page 4 6. By all accounts, natural forest cover4 has been dramatically reduced over the years, and needs urgent attention. Forest cover is optimistically estimated to be about 1.3 million hectares (or 2.2% of land use in 1996), down from 1.9 million hectares in 1979, corresponding to an annual loss of over 35,000 hectares during the same period. The FAO 1996 Forestry and Agroforestry Report mentions an estimate of 368,000 hectares of actual intact forest, corresponding to an annual loss exceeding 90,000 hectares over the period 1972-1996. Even in the most optimistic case, if the hemorrhage is not stopped now, within 15-20 years, Afghanistan will have no more natural forest left (Figure 1). 7. The major cause of deforestation is the demand for timber production for sale and fuel (Box 1). Timber theft and cross border smuggling (mostly on the Pakistan side) is reported to be more devastating than local community harvesting for fuel and building materials. In the south east of the country, where most of the remaining forest is located, it is estimated that over 500,000 m3 of wood is extracted annually. Box 1. Major causes and impacts of deforestation Main causes: High demand for timber both for local use and for export markets (large scale  charcoal production has destroyed much of the juniper woodland in the north; and the coniferous forests in the east have served as the main fuel source for Kandahar and Kabul) Non sustainable practices of felling, use, and natural regeneration  Weak management of forests and regulatory oversight  Lack of incentives for the promotion of plantation forests  Encroachment on forest land for agriculture and urban use  Lack of community involvement/ownership and focus on social forestry  Tribal feuds and local conflict.  Main impacts: Watershed degradation (vegetation, runoff, erosion, evaporation, recharge)  Climate impacts (rainfall, carbon sequestration)  Loss of biodiversity (especially the loss of indigenous species, loss of wildlife  habitat) Loss of livelihood sources (biomass, non timber forest products)  8. The impact on biodiversity is less well understood but is believed to be significant and in some cases irreversible, as exemplified by the reported capture in 1997 of what was apparently the last pair of Caspian Tigers in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, and which may have put an end to the survival of this highly endangered and almost extinct species.5 Other species such as the markhor goat, snow leopard, wolf, red fox, brown bear, ermine, and lynx, much sought after for their furs, have been much reduced by hunting and habitat degradation. 9. Afghanistan used to be a major regional producer of fruits and horticulture products (e.g., pistachio, nuts, apricots, apples, and dried raisins), contributing 50-70% of agricultural GDP. In addition, the country has a limited but well-established tradition of growing poplar and 4 5  The main natural forest species are: Olive, Oak, Pine, Cedar, Ash, Willow, Spruce fir, and Juniper.

Box 2. Afghanistan's pistachio nut forest The Department of Forestry and Rangelands estimates that most of the 450,000 hectares of pistachio forest (in the northern belt of the country) while still standing, is severely degraded (*). This forest, a major source of income and conservation services, has traditionally been managed as a ""quasi common property resource"" under an arrangement where ownership and maintenance was the responsibility of the government, and (free) exploitation was left to local communities, with the government collecting taxes on pistachio export. It is estimated that local communities extract 15-20 metric tons of shelled seeds from the forest annually. In the northwest of Afghanistan, the savanna of the Badghis province supports a unique wild pistachio forests which was one of the major exports of the Afghan economy, with a production of 3,800 metric ton (from 4,700 ha); it is estimated that this forest has been cut in half (FAOSTAT, 2000). (*) No field surveys were conducted recently to confirm this information. Other sources indicate that half of this forest has been cut for fuelwood and timber.  B.  An Institutional Framework in a State of Collapse  10. Currently the DFR is part of the ""second tier presidencies"" (departments) within the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (MAAH). The department's main facilities in Kabul, a headquarters building a ""mapping and information"" unit, and several experimental nurseries, were destroyed (or badly damaged) during the war. Thus, DFR is an empty shell with a reported staff of 300, about 60 of which populate a few borrowed offices in Kabul in MAAH, and the rest scattered around the provinces with no clear mandate nor resources. Only about one third of the staff have any technical training in agriculture related fields. 11. Forest legislation has been in draft use rights of local tribes in many parts of border with Pakistan (Kunar, Paktia, Logar, lack of a legal framework clarifying tenure, with the collapse of government institution controlled by local elites or tribal leaders. C. form for years, awaiting clarification of tenure and the country, and particularly in the areas along the Nangarhar, Laghamn, and Nuristan). In addition, the use rights, and oversight responsibilities, combined s over the years, have led to resource rents being  A Disconnect with Community Based Initiatives  12. Most of the conservation work on the ground in the past twenty years has been done by a multitude of NGOs, with little coordination or involvement of the central and provincial government. In most cases, livelihood sustenance was the key objective, and NGOs worked directly with local communities through either formal or informal arrangements with the local shuras to provide services spanning the whole range of rural development services. In terms of   Appendix 2 page 6 NRM, most of the programs appear to have been focusing mainly on horticulture and agroforestry (fruit and non fruit tree sapling distribution and planting; nursery establishment; nursery and orchard development/management; demonstration gardens, seed and fertilizer provision, timber cutting and plantation management, and training and awareness raising). 13. Despite the apparent substantial contribution of NGOs, there has been little coordination of these programs, and no overall evaluation of their cumulative impact on environmental resources, either at the national level or regional level.6 III. MEDIUM TERM DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK FOR NRM  14. Based on the needs assessment and the sector issues discussed in this note, the overall approach is to focus on key policy and institutional building actions-packaged together with a few pilot activities on the ground--to clarify and restore the ""public goods"" role of the state (both at the national and local levels), and help empower local communities and the private sector to be the stewards of the natural resources on which livelihoods and profitability depend. A summary of the medium term development framework (MTDF) and a proposed program of actions are given in Table 1. A. Objectives  15. The overall objective of MTDF is to lay the foundation for the creation of an enabling environment that would lead to the enhancement and sustainable management of Afghanistan's forest and watershed resources, and improve their productivity and socio-economic benefit flows. MTDF's more specific objectives include: 16. Objective 1. To support institutional reforms within the Ministry of Agriculture, in line with the principles of the government's National Development Framework, in order to provide a basis for the Department of Forestry and Rangelands (DFR) to fulfill its (newly and clearly defined) ""public goods"" role in relation to the country's forests and watersheds. 17. Under this objective, the short-term program will strengthen DFR's capacity to help GoA formulate forest, biodiversity, and watershed management policy, in coordination with other government agencies (particularly, MRRD, MAAH, MIWR, and AACA), local communities, and other key stakeholders. At a minimum, DFR's capacity should be restored in order to enable it to urgently begin a dialogue with local communities, tribal leaders, the timber industry, and other stakeholders, in order to halt deforestation and pasture conversion, and begin a process of overhauling forest policy to clarify the role of the public sector and to clarify tenure rights and responsibilities over forest, pasture, and rangeland resources. To achieve these objectives, DFR needs to have a core capacity of trained staff, information management tools, and adequate logistical and recurrent budget support. 18. In addition, DFR should have an important input in the definition of priorities and programs within the agriculture and rural sectors that have NRM implications (e.g., government  6  This conclusion is based on the findings of the mission, which included a meeting with 15 NGOs in Kabul on April 21, 2000.   Appendix 2 page 7 policy on water management, agroforestry,7 agricultural research & extension, livestock, and energy). However, DFR should get out of the business of nurseries, horticulture, and agroforestry, and commercial plantations, with the exception of an information dissemination and regulatory role to insure that appropriate safeguards are adhered to by private operators and commercial forestry. 19. Objective 2. To implement a few pilot projects to demonstrate the economic and social impacts of forest and watershed conservation. In rural areas, pilots would be based on the Community Driven Development (CDD) model already initiated by Government of Afghanistan with World Bank assistance. In urban and peri-urban areas, pilot aforestation and promotion of commercial plantations would contribute to employment generation, wood production for urban and construction use, and environmental protection of urban centers (e.g., the Kabul shelter belt program). 20. Objective 3. To support Government of Afghanistan prepare and issue an interim forest policy aimed at: (i) curbing illegal logging, (ii) promoting private sector plantation forestry, and community forest and watershed management, (iii) preparing a program for rehabilitation, expansion and conservation of natural forests, and (iv) preparing a detailed assessment of pasture and rangeland resources. 21. Objective 4. To consolidate the enabling environment for sustainable NRM in Afghanistan, and promote scaling up watershed and forest conservation projects based on the lessons learned from the early pilots. B. 22. Instruments It is proposed to support MTDF's implementation: (i) In the short-term (1-2 years), through the following program: 1. A technical assistance project targeted at institutional reform of the Department of Forestry, and including provision of equipment, information systems and monitoring capacity (including acquisition of remote sensing and GIS database of forest cover and watershed resources), training, and preparation of an interim forest policy (US$2-3 million). A pilot watershed management project building on the ongoing community development program and supporting rural communities to develop and implement livelihood enhancing micro-watershed conservation plans (US$3-5 million). Baseline studies, including: (a) an assessment of household energy use options for fuelwood substitution, and pilot demonstration program; (b) an assessment of existing rangelands; (c) viability of peri-urban forest plantations; and (d) other studies (to be defined).  2.  3.  7  In addition, in order to maximize its economic and environmental benefits at the farm and community level, DFR should collaborate with other departments within MOA to promote the integration of agroforestry with agricultural programs in the form of (i) short rotation timber trees (e.g., poplar) intercropped with arable crops; (ii) timber/fodder trees grown within pasture and/or rangelands; (iii) shelter belts and edge rows for soil and water conservation; and (iv) orchard intercropping using horticulture.   Appendix 2 page 8 (ii) And in the medium-term (2-5 years), through the following program: 1. A technical assistance project aimed at (a) consolidating institutional reforms and re-hauling forest legislation to include polices on (i) joint management by communities, (ii) commercial logging in natural forests and timber harvesting, (iii) plantation and agro forestry, (iv) biodiversity conservation, and (v) watershed management; and (b) developing community forestry (of certain types of state owned forests (e.g., pistachio and agro-forestry plantations) (US$5-10 million). 2. A GEF project to support the protection of the remaining natural forest and pilot alternative household energy supplies (US$8-10 million).   Appendix 2 page 9  Fig ure 1 .

WATER SECTOR ISSUES AND CURRENT POLICY FRAMEWORK  Summary of Key Sector Issues  1. Since rainfall is scant and highly variable over most of the country where topography and soils are suitable for agriculture, there are few areas where rainfed crops can provide a reliable basis for livelihoods. Hence, the evolution and growth of agriculture in Afghanistan, indeed even permanent settlement, has been dominated by the opportunity to develop irrigation. By 1978 surveys indicated that 80 percent of wheat and 85 percent of all crops were produced on irrigated land, and this is reported to be the prevailing situation today. Food security therefore depends in large part on water availability and water"

EU trade with developing countries Competition, Rising Prices Confront U.S. Soybean Exports Genetically Engineered Crops: U.S. Adoption & Impacts  The U.S. soybean crop for 2002 is forecast at 2,628 million bushels, well below last year's record 2,891 million. The forecast reflects both a decline in plantings and a slip in expected yield. Crop rotations, improved net returns for corn (with lower costs for nitrogen fertilizer), and economic and weather conditions in western states encouraged greater planting of corn and the lowest U.S. soybean area since 1998. Soybean yields were curbed by summer drought and high temperatures, and by an acreage shift from higher yielding to lower yielding states. Lower soybean supplies will promote a hard retreat in U.S. soybean exports. Higher U.S. prices will erode the ability to compete with likely aggressive export campaigns by Brazil and Argentina. Cabbage Heads Higher  Since the introduction of genetically engineered (GE) crops in 1996, U.S. farmers have rapidly adopted some varieties, notwithstanding conflicting claims about economic and environmental impacts and consumer acceptance. Soybeans and cotton with herbicide-tolerant traits have been the most widely and rapidly adopted GE crops in the U.S., followed by insect-resistant cotton and corn. Analyses by USDA's Economic Research Service and others indicate economic benefits to many farmers adopting firstgeneration GE crops. Not all benefits of GE crop adoption are reflected in standard measures of net returns. Does Of f-Farm Work Hinder ""Smart"" Farming?  The French word for cabbage is incorporated into a term of endearment: ""mon petit chou"" (""my little cabbage""). This vegetable has recently become a little more endearing to Americans, a turnaround from a steady decline in use between the 1920s and the 1990s when Americans looked elsewhere for variety and convenience in their food. In the past decade, fresh-cut products, new recipes, and a growing body of nutritional research have lent new support to cabbage demand. Total cabbage consumption rose to 10.3 pounds per person in the early 2000s, but is still 57 percent below the 1920s. The Ongoing Reform of Land Tenure Policies in China  land is scarce relative to its labor. Control over land in China reflects a complex and changing distribution of authority among the national government, local governments, and households, with potential implications for efficiency, equity, and environmental quality. Trade Among Unequal Partners  The combined forces of economic transition, rapid economic growth, and increased integration into the world economy are propelling substantial changes in rural China. How farmers respond to changing economic opportunities and challenges depends critically on the choices they are able to make about use of land and other resources--choices that depend in turn on land tenure patterns. With 9 percent of the world's arable land and 40 percent of the world's farmers, China's  The European Union (EU), more than other members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), has used exceptions to international trading rules to provide nonreciprocal trading preferences to selected developing countries. Some of these arrangements have been challenged under WTO procedures as discriminatory and not in compliance with trade rules. To achieve compatibility, the EU proposes to convert the arrangements into reciprocal free trade areas, which for developing countries could result in new trade competition and economic challenges, without clear advantages. The EU, on the other hand, would gain strong advantages for its agricultural and other exports to some developing countries at the expense of exports from the U.S. and other countries. Many elements of the EU's current and proposed free trade area arrangements remain controversial and untested in the WTO.  As off-farm income takes on greater importance to farm households, less time is available for farm management. Smart farming (e.g., soil testing, integrated pest management, and precision farming) typically substitutes management for capital, and management is time-intensive. The value of management time and effort does not typically enter into calculations of economic returns to alternative production technologies or farming systems. The result could be misleading in understanding the benefits of technology adoption, particularly if farm households, like most of their nonfarm counterparts, are willing to forego some financial return from farming to gain convenience. U.S. Sugar Policy Under the 2002 Farm Act  The 2002 Farm Act reauthorized the sugar price support loan program, and a key change requires that USDA operate the program at no cost to the Federal government. To accomplish this, the Act includes measures to discourage forfeiture of sugar to the government by processors who offered it as collateral for nonrecourse loans under the program. Among the cost-reducing provisions is the authority for USDA to impose flexible marketing allotments for sugar (supply control)."
GX253-04-14589456	"Agricultural Outlook/September 2002  Economic Research Service/USDA  15  World Agriculture & Trade Collectives also maintain the right to reallocate land between households periodically. Some reallocations are instigated by the xiaozu--groups of 30-40 households that are often the de facto owners of farmland--and only affect selected households. Under village-wide reallocations (cunzhuang tiaozheng), the village leadership makes the allocation decisions and most, if not all, of the land in the village is reallocated. The collective's right to reallocate land introduces tenure insecurity since farm households cannot count on being allocated rights to the same land in the future. Bryan Lohmar  The Ongoing Reform of Land Tenure Policies in China  T  he combined force of economic transition, rapid economic growth, and increased integration into the world economy are propelling substantial changes in rural China. The changes not only expose China's farmers to competition from producers in other countries, but also provide them greater autonomy and incentives to produce crops more efficiently, drawing farm households from subsistence production into more commercialized agriculture and shifting rural resources out of agriculture into other sectors of the economy. How farmers respond to changing economic opportunities and challenges depends critically on the choices they are able to make about the use of land and other resources. These choices depend in turn on land tenure patterns. With 9 percent of the world's arable land and 40 percent of the world's farmers, China is scarce in land relative to labor. Control over land in China (as elsewhere) reflects a complex and changing distribution of authority among national governments, local governments, and households, with potentially important implications for efficiency, equity, and environmental quality.  Land Tenure in China Today China once had an active land market, but land tenure practices have undergone several major transformations since the early 1950s. The lack of incentives and the difficult management burdens inherent in the collective system (1958-78) ultimately gave way to reforms that restored the farm household as the main unit of production. Nevertheless, land rights continue to be shared by collectives and households. Collective rights. Collectives maintain formal ownership of farmland in China, and the collective body allocates land use rights to member households. Initial allocations took place in villages during 1978-84 as what later became the Household Responsibility System (HRS) was evolving. To maintain the egalitarian access to land that was a hallmark of the collective system, households were generally allocated rights to land on a per capita basis (some villages also took the number of workers into consideration). Despite efforts to maintain fairness by allocating each household multiple plots of varying quality, these allocations had the potential to be very contentious.  Household rights. Farm households' rights consist primarily of rights to produce and dispose of crops, although rights vary by type of plot. Farmers make most of the production decisions on their land, but the land must stay in agricultural production. Villages sometimes impose compulsory planting requirements on some of the land allocated to farm households. For example, most households receive responsibility land from which they are required to produce and deliver a fixed amount of grain to the state, although the grain delivery obligation has not been enforced in many provinces in the last few years. More recently, some villages have sought to promote cultivation of specific cash crops, and have imposed compulsory planting requirements on some plots. Some villages allow land to go fallow, but others enforce fallow taxes. Household land rights are subject to local taxes and fees (often paid in kind), which are usually based on households' land allocations. The 1984 directive sanctioning the HRS explicitly extended to farm households the right to rent their land to other households, and most villages now allow households to exercise this right. A growing land rental market has developed, particularly in certain regions, but land rental arrangements in China tend to be very informal and short-term. Further growth in land rental transactions may be constrained by ambiguity over these rights. A 1996 survey of 780 rural households in northeast China found that 76 percent of farm households did not know if they had the right to rent their land to others.   16  Economic Research Service/USDA  Agricultural Outlook/September 2002  World Agriculture & Trade Reallocation Practices Since the original land allocations to households at the beginning of HRS, roughly 80 percent of villages have reallocated their land at least once. But reallocation practices vary widely. In Guizhou Province, less than 5 percent of the villages have carried out a reallocation since HRS, while in other provinces this figure is above 90 percent. In the 1996 survey of rural households in northeast China, 4 of the 31 villages reported no village-wide land reallocations as of 1995, but 3 villages had reallocated land nearly every year since adoption of HRS. Why some provinces and local regions engage in reallocations while others do not is not fully understood and is widely debated among China scholars. There are a variety of possible economic and political explanations for these differences. Underlying changes in household demographics are usually cited as the main motivation to reallocate village land. Marriages, births, and deaths can change the number of people in village households so the original land distributions no longer represent the egalitarian ideal. Many argue, however, that egalitarian reasons are usually not the main motivation for land reallocations. Other reasons for land reallocations may include number of workers and availability of nonfarm employment. Many villages explicitly consider the number of workers, and sometimes the number of workers depending on agriculture, in their reallocation decisions. Villages where nonfarm employment is abundant may have established policies to pool land and allocate it to a small subset of village households to farm with labor-saving equipment. Many of these villages then allocate shares of the profits from agricultural production to village households. Households in which workers are engaged in nonfarm employment have less demand for their land, making them vulnerable to dispossession in land reallocations. In very wealthy villages where all residents earn income from nonfarm sources, farmland may be rented out to migrant workers.  Land Rights Are Distributed at Many Levels National government The central government establishes national land laws and directives that provide guidelines for local policymakers. Provincial as well as national policies affect local policies. For example, Guizhou Province promotes secure 30-year use rights for farmers, and has far less reallocation activity than other provinces. In some areas, townships may influence village land policies, including village-wide land reallocations. A township district contains roughly 1020 villages. Villages in China comprise roughly 300-500 households. Village leaders usually have ultimate authority on land allocation, but often delegate some or all of this authority to the xiaozu.  Provinces  Townships  Villages  Xiaozu  Xiaozu are groups of 30-40 households (remnants of production teams organized during the collective period). Xiaozu are often the de facto owners of the land, but generally work with village leaders on land allocation. Xiaozu leaders may periodically reallocate land among member households, usually to provide land for new households at marriage. Households are allocated rights to use land, usually several small plots. Specific rights on each plot may vary, but are mainly the right to farm the land for a finite period and to keep or sell the produce. Individual farmers do not have rights to the land, but farm the land allocated to their households.  Households  Farmers  Land management practices vary at the local level in China in part because of ambiguities in national laws and policies. National land laws state that rural land is collectively owned and that village leaders have ultimate authority over agricultural land. In some villages, however, the xiaozu are recognized as the de facto owners, while in other areas townships wield considerable influence over land use policy. In a recent World Bank survey, 26 percent of households reported that farmers (through their xiaozu) have the primary decisionmaking power concerning land reallocations, while 43 percent replied that villages had this authority, and 24 percent indicated the township was the primary decisionmaker. Instances of villages or townships reallocating land from village households also abound, with land often passed to outside investors for nonagricultural uses. Compensation to farm households in such cases is arbitrary.  residents out of severe poverty. Key factors in these developments include the enhanced incentives afforded to China's farmers once they had greater access to land and rights to their production. Unlike many countries at similar stages of development, China does not have a large population of rural landless workers vulnerable to famine or other extreme economic shocks. This is in part due to land tenure policies that guarantee households access to land. China does have large numbers of ruralurban migrants, but they are spread among several large urban centers and hundreds of smaller urban centers, and the number of rural-urban migrants is likely much smaller than it would be if land were not allocated on a per capita basis. Relatively egalitarian access to land has also ensured that nearly all rural households are at least food self-sufficient, and has been linked to levels of nutrition higher than other countries with similar income levels. On the other hand, China's reallocation policies may have negative effects on land use efficiency. Many observers argue that tenure insecurity generated by realloca-  Equity, Efficiency, & Environment China's land tenure policies have both positive and negative effects. After adoption of HRS, productivity growth in agriculture and rural incomes rose dramatically, lifting hundreds of millions of rural   Agricultural Outlook/September 2002  Economic Research Service/USDA  17  World Agriculture & Trade tion policies undermines households' incentives to invest in their land. The fragmented nature of household land holdings and the small plot sizes may also discourage investment. The negative effect on investment may be most pronounced in the case of expensive, long-term investments such as orchards, wells, and ditches. This may slow the process of specialization into labor-intensive crops for which China has a comparative advantage, since many of these crops require large investments. It may also slow the shift to higher-valued crops that are increasingly in demand by China's wealthy urban consumers. China's land tenure practices may also adversely affect the process of specialization by making it difficult to take advantage of economies of size and scale and by discouraging movement off-farm. Farm households that develop successful cash crop operations may face obstacles to expanding these operations due to the difficulty of acquiring land. Other farm households may not rent their land to these specialized households due to village policies that discourage renting, or out of fear that renting out land heightens the risk of dispossession in the next reallocation. Research suggests that land rental activity is constrained, but precise causes remain unclear. It may be that the risk of dispossession reduces the supply of land for rent. Alternatively, it could be that periodic land reallocations decrease overall demand for rental land. Households may also be discouraged from allocating labor off-farm for fear that land may be taken away if it appears they do not need it. When rights to land are ambiguous, households have an incentive to stay in the village and protect their rights by continuous occupation and cultivation. Concern is also growing about the effects of China's land tenure policies on the environment. Farm households with insecure tenure have less incentive to apply conservation practices since the land is not theirs in perpetuity. This may encourage farm households to expand farm operations on environmentally sensitive land, causing soil erosion, overgrazing, and other environmental problems.  The Evolution of China's Land Tenure System Private land markets, pre-1949. Under China's feudal system, land was held by small landowners who farmed their own land, and by landlords who rented land to tenant farmers. Land markets were supported by (often local) institutions to define boundaries, register ownership, and provide titles. Land reform, 1950-53. China's new government implemented a national land reform movement soon after coming to power in 1949. Landholdings were redistributed to landless and land-short farm households. Deeds held by landlords were destroyed, and new deeds were issued to the new owners along with full rights to rent and sell their land. Initial collectivization, 1953-57. Shortly after land reform, Party cadres began encouraging farmers to set up agricultural producer cooperatives--small groups of farm households that pooled some or all of their land and farmed the larger plots collectively. Income was distributed according to the land each household contributed to collective production. After forming cooperatives, the cooperatives were pooled into larger collectives where income was distributed according to the amount of land and labor contributed. By 1957, over 90 percent of farm households had organized into roughly 700,000 large agricultural collectives. Full collectivization, 1958-78. Under the Great Leap Forward, agricultural collectives were ultimately merged into 24,000 communes encompassing entire townships. Households turned over nearly all of their productive assets, and teams of workers carried out nearly all production (households often maintained small private plots during all or part of the collective period). Income was distributed according to labor contribution and need through a complex system of ""workpoints."" This system existed through the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), except for a period of partial liberalization in the early 1960s. Decollectivization, 1978-84. Under new leadership, China's government encouraged efforts to alleviate poverty and induce economic growth. Many rural areas abandoned collective production entirely and contracted with households to deliver fixed amounts of grain in exchange for access to land. Households were allowed to keep the remaining production for their own consumption or to sell on the market. Household Responsibility System, 1984-present. In 1984, the expanding system of contracting with households directly was officially approved by China's national government. The law stipulated that land was still owned by the collective, but did not clarify whether the collective was the village or the xiaozu. The law also stipulated that households should receive 15-year contracts to their land, and have the right to rent land and hire labor. Collectives maintained the right to reallocate land among households. Subsequent clarifications and directives have encouraged extending the contract length from 15 to 30 years, providing households with written contracts, and limiting the collective's right to reallocate land.  Toward a Land Market in China Scholars and observers both inside and outside China advocate policies to increase tenure security. Some call for establishment of a land market based on private ownership of land. Others argue that this may exacerbate existing problems or generate new ones, noting that without a system of title registration,  enforcement, and credit, a land market based on private property rights may be unworkable. It might also result in a concentration of land ownership and the rise of landless households, an outcome that is politically unacceptable to China's leaders. Market-based outcomes, however, can be achieved through a system of clear, enforceable, and tradable rights, without establishing full private ownership.   18  Economic Research Service/USDA  Agricultural Outlook/September 2002  World Agriculture & Trade The Incidence of Land Reallocation Varies Among Provinces cally allows reallocation. Indeed, of the farmers who were aware of the national policy encouraging 30-year use rights and written contracts, only 12 percent felt that these policies will definitely prevent reallocations during the 30-year term, and 46 percent felt that reallocations will definitely continue despite the new policy. These findings point to the critical issue of enforcement. No matter which policies are established to increase tenure security, they will fall short of their goal so long as fair and accessible institutions are not also established to resolve conflicts and settle disputes. Funding such a system through higher levels of government would help ensure that local governments do not use their control over finances to sway decisions. But such a system can be expensive, and China's government faces severe fiscal constraints already. There are alternative ways to build a land market in China other than by establishing full private ownership rights in land. Clarifying and enforcing existing land rights, and making these rights tradable, has the potential to improve farm households' incentives for investment and specialization while maintaining broader public interests in equity and the environment. Fundamentally, a land market is simply a set of clear and enforceable property rights--including partial rights such as existing household rights to use land and dispose of crops--and a mechanism to trade these rights. China currently has a set of partial land rights that appears complex and ambiguous when viewed from the national level, since local areas engage in such a wide variety of land tenure practices. But the rights in particular localities may be very well established. If existing rights can be codified and institutions set up to enforce and trade them, right-holders will be able to trade them according to market principles--even in the absence of full private ownership at the household level.

Production hasn't fully rebounded since the disastrous ice storm struck the northern region of the state in 1998 and damaged sugar bushes. Syrup production is estimated at 228,000 gallons, up from the 193,000 gallons produced in 2001 according to the New York Agricultural Statistics Service. Only two states, Vermont and Maine, produced more syrup.   The number of taps, 1.24 million, increased 7 percent from last year.  Syrup produced per tap averaged 0.184 gallons, up from 0.166 in 2001.  The final value of the 2001 crop is $5.69 million.  Decreased production offset an increase in price from the 2000 crop.   Lack of heavy snowcover made tapping trees and running tubing much easier this year. Mild weather early in the spring resulted in an early maple season. The season opened on February 22 and closed on March 29. Opening date was the earliest since records began in 1972. The extended season pushed yield per tap to the highest level since 1966.   Sap was slightly below average for sweetness, requiring an average of 44 gallons to make one gallon of syrup. Syrup quality was 19 percent dark, 53 percent medium, and 28 percent light. Temperatures were reported as 28 percent too warm, 61 percent favorable, and 11 percent too cold.

MAY PRICES RECEIVED DOWN    Prices received by New York farmers during May for selected agricultural commodities were mostly lower compared with a month earlier, according to the New York Agricultural Statistics Service. Prices for corn, oats, wheat, soybeans, milk, and eggs declined while hay prices increased. Fresh market apple prices were unchanged from April.   At the National level, the preliminary All Farm Products Index of Prices Received by Farmers was 98 based on 1990-92=100, up 3 points from the revised April index. Higher prices for broilers, potatoes, hogs, and oranges more than offset lower prices for lettuce, cattle, milk, and cucumbers. Compared with May last year, the All Farm Products Index was down 10 points.

MAY MILK PRODUCTION UP 7 PERCENT    Milk production in the Empire State during May totaled 1.11 billion pounds, up 7 percent from the 1.04 billion pounds of milk produced in New York during May 2001. Both a larger milking herd and a higher output of milk per cow contributed to the increase. The 680,000 dairy cows on farms during May were up 1 percent from a year earlier. Milk per cow averaged 1,630 pounds during the month, up 90 pounds from the May 2001 output.   May milk production in the 20 major producing States totaled 13.0 billion pounds, up 3.2 percent from production in these same States during May 2001. Production per cow in the 20 major States averaged 1,681 pounds for May, 49 pounds above a year earlier. The number of cows on farms was 7.76 million head, 14,000 head more than May 2001, and 9,000 head more than April 2002.

Nielsen - USDA-ARS, Akron, Colorado                                   The Question: How much water does sunflower use, and how does water use     affect yield?                                            To     make an informed decision regarding the use of sunflower in   dryland crop rotations,     producers need to know something about the water relationships of this crop in the central     Great Plains. At Akron, CO, rainfall during the sunflower growing season averages about 9     in. But the total amount of water required for sunflower to grow without water stress in     this environment averages about 34 in. Some of the 25 in. shortfall in rainfall is made up     for by stored soil water. But dryland sunflower in this area is almost always growing     under some water deficit condition which reduces yield from the maximum attainable.       Reports of sunflower water use range widely from 8 to 38 in. per year.     The higher values come from irrigated studies or high rain conditions. Sunflower grown     where the soil water profile is full will also use greater amounts of water. Sunflower has     the ability to extract water from deeper in a soil profile than other crops. In addition,     sunflower will extract more water from each soil layer than other crops. Average stored     water use for several crops is shown in Fig. 1. Proso millet extracts about 4in. from the     top 3 ft. of soil, whereas sunflower extracts about 7.5 in. from the 6 ft. soil profile.     Of course, crop rotational sequence will make a difference on how much soil water is     available for sunflower to use. (Fig. 2) (S=Sunflower, F=Fallow, W=Winter Wheat, M=Proso     Millet, P=Field Pea). Sunflower following millet in a sunflower-      fallow-wheat-millet rotation uses more water than sunflower in a sunflower-fallow-wheat     rotation because more water is typically available following millet than following wheat.     At Akron, the sunflower soil water use ranges from 3 to 9 in. for different cropping     systems and different years.       A water use/yield function generated from both dryland and irrigated     sunflower (Fig. 3) shows that about 150 lb/a of seed is produced for every inch of water     use after the first 7 in. of water use. Dryland sunflower yields at Akron have ranged from     100 lb/a to 2000 lb/a. Sunflower yield is very responsive to rainfall received during     August and September, just prior to flowering and through seed-filling, (Fig. 4). The     relationship for yield vs rainfall (158 lb/a/in.) is almost the same as for yield vs total     water use (151 lb/a/in.).       Using the water use/yield relationship (Fig. 3) and the Akron rainfall     record from 1965-1997, and conservatively assuming 6.75 in. of soil water use, we see a     predicted sunflower yield distribution of 570-2090 lb/a, with an average yield of 1360     lb/a (Fig. 5). Nearly half of the years of record would have yields in the 1000-1500 lb/a     range.       The very dry condition of the soil profile following sunflower requires     significant water recharge prior to the planting of the next crop in rotation. It is     essential that stalks be left standing in good condition such that snow trapping can occur     during storms with strong winds. Tall stalks will trap more snow than short stalks.     Overwinter soil water change is closely related to sunflower silhouette factor (height x     diameter x population) due to the increase in snow trapping that occurs with taller stalks     at high populations (Fig. 6). A population of 14,000 stalks per acre (3.57 stalks per 1600     in 2 ), one inch in diameter, and 16.7 in. tall would have a silhouette factor of     60, and be expected to recharge the soil water profile by about 4 in. under average winter     conditions at Akron.                                                                                                                                 In summary, precipitation falls     far short of evaporative demand in dryland sunflower production in the central Great     Plains. Sunflowers are able to extract water from deep in the soil profile and are able to     extract more water from each soil layer than other crops. About 150 lb/a of sunflower seed     are produced for every inch of water used after the first 7 in. of water use. Based on     this water use/yield relationship and local rainfall records, sunflower yields should     average about 1300 to 1400 lb/a near Akron. Because of the very dry condition of the soil     following sunflower, it is essential to catch as much snow as possible by leaving tall     stalks standing through the winter so that the soil water profile can be recharged.

Amidon   Tuesday,   February 19, 2002     www.nass.usda.gov/ny       2001 NEW YORK MILK PRODUCTION DECLINES    Annual milk production in the Empire State during 2001 totaled 11.8 billion pounds, according to the New York Agricultural Statistics Service. This annual production was down 1 percent from 11.9 billion pounds in 2000. The annual average number of milk cows, at 672,000, was down 2 percent from a year earlier. Output per cow increased by 149 pounds, or 1 percent, to a record high 17,527 pounds per cow.   Milk production at the National level for 2001 was down 1 percent from 2000 to 165.3 billion pounds. The output per cow, at 18,139 pounds, was 62 pounds below the 2000 rate. The average number of cows during the year was 9.12 million head, down 1 percent from 2000.   New York continues to rank third behind California and Wisconsin in both the number of milk cows and total milk produced. Manufactured dairy products utilize large volumes of milk, and preliminary estimates indicate that the output of many manufactured products in the State decreased while some increased.   Butter output in the State during 2001 totaled 27 million pounds, up 25 percent from a year earlier. U.S. output of butter, at 1.22 billion pounds, was down 4 percent from the 2000 level.   American type cheese production in New York during 2001 totaled 98 million pounds, 2 percent more than the previous year. The National output, at 3.55 billion pounds, was down 2 percent from 2000.   New York cheese plants produced 403 million pounds of Italian cheese in 2001, 3 percent less than a year earlier. This total represents 12 percent of the total United States Italian cheese production, down from 13 percent in 2000. Nationally, the 3.32 billion pounds of Italian cheese produced during 2001 was up slightly from 2000.   The combined creamed and lowfat cottage cheese production for New York during 2001 totaled 145 million pounds, up 2 percent from the previous year. This production accounted for 20 percent of the National total. The combined U.S. output of 737 million pounds was essentially unchanged from 2000.   Preliminary estimates indicate that cheese production for New York in 2001, excluding cottage cheese, totaled 709 million pounds, down 3 percent from the record high total of 728 million pounds in 2000. Preliminary comparable totals for the U.S. put total cheese production at 8.15 billion pounds, 1 percent below 2000.     #   2-19-02   Return to the  Table of Contents for Press Releases

That's because the scientists have found a gene in barley that makes plants more able to withstand aluminum. A major component of soil clay, aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust. At neutral or alkaline pH, it's not a problem for plants. However, in acid soils, the main form of aluminum is highly toxic to plants.   Aluminum toxicity can limit crop production on acid soils that cover well over half the world's 8 billion acres of potentially arable land, including about 86 million acres in the United States. When soils become acid, the toxic aluminum damages plant root systems, greatly reducing yields on these soils.    One approach to reducing aluminum toxicity is to develop crop varieties with increased genetic resistance to aluminum. ARS plant molecular biologist David F. Garvin--working with plant physiologist Leon V. Kochian at the  U.S. Plant, Soil and Nutrition Laboratory  in Ithaca, N.Y.--identified genetic markers for a single gene in barley that enhances aluminum tolerance. These markers can be used in breeding programs to rapidly shuttle aluminum tolerance genes from aluminum-tolerant barley varieties to aluminum-sensitive ones.    Furthermore, the results of their study suggest that aluminum tolerance in barley and its close relative, wheat, is due to the action of different forms of the same gene. Since wheat possesses superior aluminum tolerance to barley, it may be possible to genetically engineer increased aluminum tolerance in barley by introducing a wheat aluminum tolerance gene.   This research could provide insights into how some important grain species--including wheat, corn and sorghum--can tolerate high levels of aluminum in acid soils. Their findings are published in the May-June 2000 issue of  Crop Science . ARS is  U.S. Department of Agriculture 's chief research agency.   Scientific contact:  David F.

NEW YORK FEED GRAIN DEFICIT IN 2000    New York feed grain production  (corn, oats, barley)  in 2000 fell 21 percent from a year earlier. The quantity of grain fed rose slightly in the same period. The number of grain consuming animal units increased slightly, while the the average quantity of grain fed per animal remained the same. Last season's wet weather, which reduced grain yields and acreage across the State, was the primary reason for the sizeable increase in the feed grain deficit from 1999.   Although the feed grain deficit has been lower in recent years than in the 1970's and 1980's, feed grain is brought into New York annually to meet the feeding requirements of the State's dairy, livestock, and poultry industry. Feed grain produced in New York during 2000 met 66 percent of the State's feeding requirements. In 1999, it met 83 percent of the State's feeding requirements.

This total is down 4 percent from the 1999 production of 4.83 million pounds.   The 2000 production was extracted from 58,000 colonies, down 16 percent from the 69,000 colonies in 1999. Honey yield per colony averaged 80 pounds, 14 percent above the 1999 yield. Honey stocks on hand across the State as of December 15, 2000 totaled 2.27 million pounds, an increase of 9 percent from the 2.08 million pounds a year earlier.   Prices received by beekeepers in New York averaged 55.0 cents per pound for all methods of sale during 2000, 17 percent less than the 1999 average price of 66.0 cents. Value of honey production for the State in 2000 totaled $2.55 million, compared with $3.19 million in 1999.   United States honey production for 2000 for producers with five or more hives totaled 221 million pounds, up 8 percent from 1999. The number of producing colonies is estimated at 2.63 million, a total which contains a limited amount of duplication due to interstate movement of bees by multi-state operators. The yield per colony averaged 83.9 pounds, up 7.5 pounds from the 76.4 pounds in 1999.   Prices received by beekeepers across the Nation averaged 59.4 cents per pound, down 1 percent from 60.1 cents in 1999. The value of the 2000 U.S. honey crop is estimated at $132 million. Mid-December stocks of honey for sale amounted to 86.2 million pounds, 9 percent more than the 79.4 million pounds on hand December 15, 1999. The 86.2 million pounds represents 39 percent of the 2000 production. Stocks on hand a year earlier also amounted to 39 percent of production.

FEBRUARY PRICES RECEIVED INCREASE    Prices received by New York farmers during February for selected commodities were mostly higher compared with a month earlier. Prices for corn, oats, wheat, soybeans, apples, milk, and eggs increased while prices for hay and potatoes declined.   Grain corn prices averaged $2.62 per bushel during February, up 27 cents from January and 31 cents above February 2000. Oat prices rose 8 cents from the previous month to $1.39 per bushel. Wheat, at $2.29 per bushel, was up 24 cents from a month earlier and 14 cents above February a year ago. Soybeans returned $4.82 per bushel, up 12 cents from January. Hay averaged $103.00 per ton baled, down $3.00 from January and $14.00 below a year earlier. Potatoes were down 15 cents from the previous month to $8.55 per hundredweight (cwt.). Apples for fresh market averaged $16.30 per cwt., 30 cents above January but 10 cents less than a year ago.   New York dairy farmers received an average of $14.20 per cwt. of milk sold during February, up 10 cents from the previous month and $1.50 above last February. Poultry producers received an average of 60.7 cents per dozen eggs sold, up 0.4 cents from January and 4.7 cents above February 2000.   At the National level, the Preliminary All Farms Products Index of Prices Received by U.S. Farmers in February was 99 based on 1990-92=100, up 2 points from the January Index. Higher prices for lettuce, broilers, oranges, and hogs were partially offset by lower prices for strawberries, soybeans, corn, and tomatoes. The seasonal change in the mix of commodities farmers sell often affects the overall index.

GX228-91-6111682	"USAID helps Afghan farmers collaborate and construct improved irrigation systems  Wells Become A Source Of Hope To Farmers Challenge In a landlocked country where only 12 percent of the land is arable, irrigating land is limited to three options: canals fed by river and rain, a natural spring, or the ancient underground aquifer known as karez. For the farmer fortunate enough to cultivate a sliver of the available 78,240 hectares of Afghan land, only an estimated 20 to 40 percent of canal-irrigated land was available for harvest in 2002 due to insufficient seed and water for irrigation. ""For only two months each year, the canal is full of water from the Pulealam River,"" says 45-year-old Mohammed Shah. ""That's ten months without water, including the entire summer.""  Initiative USAID helped Afghan farmers, like Mohammed Shah, build eight shallow wells for diesel pumps in the Kabul and Logar provinces. Irrigation projects often target farmers without the means to irrigate from canals. However, this particular project in Logar helped a group of five farmers with handicapped canal access, who each wanted to cultivate approximately 2 hectares of land apiece. The wells themselves are covered cylindrical brick houses enclosed around a spiral staircase that steps into the cold earth one concrete step at a time. Flexible hoses similar to those used by firefighters in the United States connect diesel pumps that suction 500 liters of water per minute to the empty canals above. The housing structure not only protects the Photo: Matt Herrick valuable pumps--a collective investment made by the farmers using the well--and helps Mohammed Shah, one of five area farmers invested in a shallow well in Logar, pauses to prevent accidents, but also assures that the chat while harvesting onions. water is free from mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects that thrive in warm, Results standing water. Combining their efforts and resources, the farmers excavated and built the structure with engineering guidance from USAID. They have all agreed to share in the startup costs to effectively manage an irrigation schedule that gives each partner a fair share of time and water, and to pitch in on repair costs when the pumps require maintenance. Mohammed turns his onions in the soil with a shovel and talks with anticipation about the 2004 planting season. ""Next year I want to sell my onions to the trucks,"" he says, referring to the produce buyers who frequent this area rich with onions, potatoes and corn.

But just in case this exotic weed should defy quarantine efforts and enter the country, researchers are searching for sources of resistance that could provide protection.   Broomrape,  Orobanche cumana,  is a parasitic plant with no capacity for making chlorophyll on its own. So it steals nourishment from sunflower roots, stunting or killing the plants. It now infests sunflower crops in China and countries bordering the Mediterranean and Black Seas.   International researchers try to develop new sunflower lines with resistance genes to keep up with the evolution of new broomrape races. But  ARS  scientists working with colleagues at the Instituto de Agricultura Sostenible in Córdoba, Spain, have taken that defense a step further. They have found a way to use interspecific hybridization—that is, crosses between cultivated sunflowers and distant relatives that were difficult to impossible to make, until now. Some of these improbable crosses have proved to be not just resistant—but immune—to broomrape race F, the newest one.   This work was spurred by losses of 40 to 50 percent of Spanish sunflower crops to broomrape races E and F in the early 1990s. Research collaboration has led to seven new, resistant sunflower germplasms derived by crossing USDA lines with race E-resistant ones from Russia, Romania, and Turkey. New conventional hybrids from those lines now growing in Spain are suffering only 10- to 15-percent yield losses.    Chao C. Jan  and  Jerry F.

Blackeye Peas Go Green    Plant breeders recently released the first-ever blackeye-type southern pea that shows the green cotyledon seed trait. Peas of the new variety retain their fresh green color, even when harvested dry. Green Dixie Blackeye was released for use by both home gardeners and the dry-pack bean industry. The peas can be harvested fresh for immediate consumption or storage in home freezers, as well as fully dry—for storage or sale as an attractive dry pack.   Green Dixie Blackeye is the result of 10 years of cross-breeding of the large, cream-type Bettergreen variety with the popular and high-yielding Bettergro Blackeye. It produces dry pods in around 70 days, each holding about 14 peas that are larger than those of Bettergro Blackeye. And it outyielded the top-producing Arkansas Blackeye #1.   Dry peas can be restored to fresh-harvest seed size and color by soaking in water for 2 hours and blanching in boiling water for 3 minutes. Seed of Green Dixie Blackeye has been offered to over 240 commercial seed growers and food-processing companies, so an adequate seed supply should be available by 2002.    Richard L.

Fish farmers routinely apply a chemical called copper sulfate to catfish-rearing ponds to curb excessive growth of oxygen-hungry algae. Less algal growth means healthier fish and lower production costs. Now researchers are wondering if the compound might also cut down on waterborne fungi that destroy catfish eggs before they can hatch into small fry.   Since the 1980s, fish farmers have had only one officially approved therapeutic drug—formalin—available to protect their eggs. Copper sulfate would be a less costly alternative that's also easier to apply and less smelly. Cooperative research with Phelps Dodge Refining Corp., El Paso, Texas, will attempt to find out if copper sulfate can protect channel catfish eggs without harming young hatchlings. Approval is already being sought for its use in treating a parasitic disease of fish called ichthyopthiriasis.    Billy R. Griffin,  USDA-ARS  Harry K.

Rice Is Nice—for Doughnut-making   Modified rice starch, rice flour, and other rice-based ingredients, when incorporated into doughnut dough, reduce the absorption of frying oil by up to 70 percent. Mixed with wheat flour, the rice ingredients make a dough that is more tender, consistent, and moist, and they reduce oil uptake. Though less oily, the doughnuts made from the experimental formulations compare favorably in taste, texture, and other sensory properties with traditional cake doughnuts.   Researchers have tried many different combinations of wheat and rice ingredients, searching for the best ratio for reducing oil absorption without sacrificing consumer appeal. Tests of the finished doughnuts showed all-wheat doughnuts to have 24 to 26 grams of oil, while some wheat-rice ones had as little as 8 grams.

GX013-95-16022411	"The    North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station         The Sunflower Moth          Distribution of the Pest    The range of sunflower moth is from Mexico and Cuba to Canada. It is usually found in all regions where wild or domesticated sunflowers (  Helianthus  ) grow.     Fecundity    There is some variation in researchers reports of egg counts from the moth. One said ""a single female laid 91 eggs, mostly in a single day"". Another said ""females lay 30 or more eggs either singly or in groups of 4-5 within or among corolla tubes of individual florets"". Also ""most oviposition takes place on the 3rd day after the head opens and 75% of eggs are laid by 6th day"" and ""lab moths laid 337 eggs in a 2 week period"". In our 1986 study at Ames, IA, we observed that 107 females laid 11,100 eggs in 8 days for an average of 103.7 eggs/female.     Emergence Period    Adults have been observed in N. Dakota and Canada from early to mid-July. They migrate from the south central U.S. Published records note first observations in the following states: Iowa (early July), Missouri (late June), Georgia (July), Texas (late April), California (early June), and Mexico (November to April).     Life Cycle and Seasonal History    The basic life cycle of the sunflower moth is as follows: Egg - hatch within 3-5 days; Larva (4-5 instars) with the 1st being  4 days, the 2nd = 3-5 days, the 3rd = 5 days, the 4th = 1-3 days, and the 5th = 10-12 days; Pupa pupate in soil for 6-7 days, and the Adult lives a couple of weeks.    Diapause depends on both temperature and photoperiod and is induced more readily at 21o C with less than 10 hrs light. Diapausing prepupae cannot survive 5o C for 7 or more consecutive days so are absent north of roughly 40o N. latitude. Nondiapausing larvae died after 1 day at 10o C but 33% of diapausing larvae survived to pupate after 7 days at 10o C. This suggests that SM is capable of overwintering much farther north than was previously thought.     Description of Life Stages        Egg: pearly white, elliptical, finely reticulated, from 0.63-0.80 mm long and    0.23-0.27 mm diameter; Larva: brown head capsule, purplish or reddish brown    body with alternate dark and light stripes running longitudinally; from 19-25    mm long; Pupa: reddish-yellow to brown, 10 mm long; Adult: buff to gray moth    with wing span of 19-20 mm and body length of 9-11 mm.     Damage and Pest Stages Involved    Pest damage is described in the literature as follows: ""larvae laid a delicate silk over surface giving a trashy appearance - early instars feed on florets rather than achenes"", ""a single larva damaged 9 achenes in a 3 week period"", ""single larva feeds on 3-12 seeds"", ""severe infestations can cause 30-60% loss"", and ""a two year study found sunflower moth larva consumed 0.29g and 0.23 g seed, respectively"".     Economic Injury Levels - Economic Thresholds    Researchers have found that ""From 12 - 24 larvae per head causes serious seed loss"" and ""the economic threshold is 1 to 2 adults per 5 plants at onset of bloom"".     Field Sampling/ Monitoring    The field is sampled using an X - Pattern, beginning at least 75-100 ft from the field margins. Sunflower moths are counted on 20 heads per sample. Five samples are taken for a total of 100 heads per field.     Pheromones or attractants    Primary sex pheromone is Z-9, E-12-tetradecadien-1-ol (Z9,E12-14:OH). Also Z-9-tetradecen-1-ol (Z9-14:OH) may be important when acting in combination with the primary sex pheromone.    In the interaction of sunflower moths with the sunflower plant, there appear to be important chemicals present in the pollen. An ethanol extract of pollen was shown to be an oviposition stimulant. Presence of pollen caused females to initiate calling behavior at a younger age and they spent more time calling. This resulted in an increased rate of egg maturation.     Relationships with Diseases    Few diseases have been identified that attack sunflower moth. A nosema fungi has been identified that attacks the European sunflower moth. This fungus attacks other Pyralids (e.g., European corn borer) so it could potentially be a control method for the sunflower moth. In Missouri, researchers found a fungus on sunflower moth called  Metarrhizum anisopliae  . They didn't mention whether or not this would be a useful ""potential"" control agent.     Rearing in the Laboratory    The rearing diet began with the basic wheat germ diet developed by Adkisson et al. and later modified by Vanderzant. Rogers modified the diet by substituting B-vitamin (with inositol) and ascorbic acid for vitamin mix. He added two anti-fungal compounds (potassium sorbate and methyl p-hydroxybenzoate). Wilson modified the diet by using vitamin fortification mix (ICN National Biochemicals) and also added an antifungal compound. He also used a microwave oven for heating agar which helps prevent burning the agar during the cooking process.    Our rearing procedure starts with one gallon size oviposition jars in which the bottoms are covered with about 5 cm of fine white sand. The sand is lightly dampened with water and covered with 15 cm filter paper. A 30 ml cup with a cotton wick and 5% sucrose solution is added to feed the adults. Oviposition pads (8 cm2) are suspended inside jar. The rearing room is kept at 24-27o C, with 60% RH, and 14:10 (light:dark). About 250 pupae, hand picked from the diet 2-3 days after pupation, are placed in a 9 cm petri dish and placed into the adult oviposition container.    Egg are collected by lifting the oviposition pad gently from jar, and shaking off any moths that may cling. Most eggs are obtained from day 3-5. Wilson and McClurg found the eggs can be stored in 5o C for up to one week without significantly reducing egg hatch. When we need larvae for testing, the eggs are moved to a 27o room where they will hatch in 2-4 days. The larvae are reared in either a 26 cm diameter (large) or 30 ml capacity (small) plastic container. The diet is scored (scratched with a sharp object) before introducing larvae. We place about 600 larvae in the large containers, but the small containers hold 6-8. It takes about 3 weeks for late instar pupae to develop.     Alternate Hosts    The sunflower moth has been found on many plant families but mostly on the Compositae (Asteraceae). The list includes, but is not all inclusive, of some of the following plants: Rosering gaillardia, Golden crownhead, Goldenmane, Lanceleaf gaillardia, Englemann daisy, Twoleaf senna, Big flower, Gumweed, African marigold, French marigold, Golden wave, Tickseed, Orange coneflower, Yellow chamomile, Romerillo blance, Citrus, Safflower, Sweetclover, Corn, Globemallow, Musk thistle, and many species of  Helianthus  .     Management - Using Natural Enemies     Beregovoy recovered 17 species of Hymenoptera and Diptera parasites from sunflower moth larvae. In a Missouri study, they found 12 parasites:  Lixophaga variabilis, Erynnia tortricis, Leskiomima tenera, Clausicella floridensis, Bracon mellitor, Bracon nuperus, Chelonus altitudinus, Apanteles homoeosomae, Agathis buttricki, Macrocentrus ancylivorus, Creamastus epagoges  , and  Perilampus epagoges  . Three were found in a Texas study:  Chelonus altitudinus, Apanteles epinotiae  , and  Clausicella neomexicana  . In California, four were found:  Mesotimes gracilis, Pristomerus pacificus, Apanteles homoeosomae  , and  Euxesta anna  . And in North Dakota two others were listed:  Lixophaga plumbea  , and  Erymnia tortricis  . Some of the parasites are found in more than one location.     Management - Host Plant Resistance    Searching for plant resistance in 1966, Kinman found a single sunflower plant with 10% damage and it was incorporated into the pedigree of hybrid T56002. In 1971, Teetes et al. showed differences in susceptibility to selected varieties. The Russian varieties armavirec' and kubanec' were less damaged than was inbred HA 6. Carlson and Witt identified resistance and tolerance in cultivars H2131 and H2135 and others in 1974. And in 1980, Jarvis evaluated 350 National Plant Germplasm System sunflowers at Ames, IA and found three resistant  H. annuus  accessions (PI 172906, PI 204578, PI 380569).    In 1984, Seiler et al. looked at 50 species of wild sunflower and found the resistance factor, phytomelanin, in pericarp of them all. Then in 1993, Dozet et al. tested populations of 23 species for presence of phytomelanin layer. The species with the highest percent phytomelanin layers include:  Helianthus salicifolius  (85%),  H. laevigatus  (80.5%),  H. strumosus  (73%),  H. resinosus  (75%),  H. giganteus  (67.5%), and  H. grosseserratus  (66%).    The literature cites other possible sources of sunflower moth resistance:  H. ciliaris, H. decapetalus, H. maximiliani, H. occidentalis ssp. occidentalis, H. pumilus, H. silphioides, H. strumosus, H. tuberosus,  and  H. petiolaris  ssp.  petiolaris.    Some biochemical compounds are involved in host-plant resistance of sunflower to the sunflower moth. In 1985, Gershenzon et al. found high levels of sesquiterpene lactones and diterpenes in glandular hairs on wild species of Helianthus. Rogers et al. tested 30 perennial and 11 annual species of Helianthus in 1989 and noted that plants were resistant when terpenes were found in floral parts and phytomelanin in seed pericarp.    At the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station, we evaluate domesticated sunflower for sunflower moth resistance by the following technique: (1) select test accessions from the sunflower collection and include the checks 894' and Arrowhead', (2) plant each accession in 2 row plots, 25 ft long, (3) infest the accession when 20 plants are at the R5.2 stage, (4) 10 plants are labeled and infested with sunflower moth eggs, (5) another 10 plants are sprayed with Asana after one week, (6) 1-2 days after spraying, all 20 plants are covered with muslin bags. By waiting one week, this allows natural pollination to occur before bagging. (7) the heads are harvested at physiological maturity, (8) head diameters are measured, the seed are removed by hand, and the seed are cleaned, weighed and counted, (9) gm seed/cm2 and no. seed/cm2 are calculated, (10) % of control is calculated by dividing infested head data by check head data, (11) accessions with % of control values 100 are considered resistant.    Some results from 1994: 48 accessions were tested, 8 had both % of control values for no. seed/cm2 and gm seed/cm2 > 100%. The resistant accessions are: PI 162453, PI 170389, PI 170401, PI 170420, PI 170428, PI 176975, PI 250853, and PI 301060.    Released germplasm: In 1984, Rogers et al. released 3 germplasm lines for resistance to sunflower moth; SFM 1 is an interspecific cross of PI 181954 X PI 423011 [H. petiolaris], SFM 3 is a cross of PI 181956 X PI 423011 and SFM 2 is a cross of PI 356301 X HA 89. All of the germplasm lines have genes that encode production of phytomelanin in their pericarp.     Management - Cultural Control    Planting date studies in Nebraska, Texas, and Georgia showed that early planted sunflowers had smaller infestations of sunflower moth. A Kansas study found that delaying planting until the middle of June reduced sunflower moth infestations and with no significant loss in yield.     Management - Chemical Control    The currently registered chemicals for control of sunflower moth are:        Asana (esfenvalerate)      Sevin (carbaryl)      Furadan (carbofuran)      Lorsban (chlorpyrifos)      Thiodan (endosulfan)      Helena/Setre (methyl parathion)      Supracide (methidathion)      Dipel (BT)       Selected bibliography for more detailed information:    Aslam, M., G.

Citrus processing creates more than 800,000 tons of dried  citrus waste annually that must be disposed of in an environmentally  acceptable way.  Currently, it's processed into low-value animal feed.   ARS researchers used enzymes to ferment the waste's simple sugars and  developed a filter system to trap peel oil.  They used yeast to convert  the sugars to ethanol and  E. coli  bacterium to break down the more  complex sugars from the oil.  Ethanol is a biofuel and acetic acid can be  used in many food and industrial products such as vinegar, flavor  components and organic solvents.  Carbon dioxide can be recaptured to make  dry ice.  The conversion process takes only 48 hours.  Scientists from the  University of Florida collaborated on the research.

ARS tests found the finely milled,  chemically treated bagasse, called quarternized resin, readily bound about  28 times as much Remazol Brilliant Red reactive dye as did regular  bagasse.  Scientists estimate the recyclable bagasse-based resin would  clean wastewater for less than half the cost of activated sludge or  chemical bleaching methods now used by the textile industry.     Food Physical Chemistry  Research , Peoria, IL    Joseph A. Laszlo, (309) 681-6322     ARS researchers have found a way to prevent a modified cotton product  known as Cellulose III from reverting to regular cotton, or Cellulose I,  when exposed to moisture.   Cellulose III is used in cotton clothing.   Originally, British scientists found that treating cotton with liquid  ammonia caused subtle changes in the crystal structures of cotton fiber  and yarn.  Special processing conditions resulted in a much stronger  sewing thread than was possible with conventional caustic treatments.   Yarn treated in a similar way was found to produce a smooth fabric with  improved wash-and-wear ratings.  But the new fiber would return to  Cellulose I when it got wet, causing some decrease in the improved  properties.  Several scientists have experimented with temperature,  pressure and other methods to develop a stable Cellulose III product.  ARS  tests showed that using ammonia vapors and high pressure (100-1700 pounds  per square inch) would result in complete and irreversible conversion to  Cellulose III.  Regular cotton was immersed in ammonia and subjected to  high pressure in a device called a Parr bomb.  Resulting Cellulose III was  stable in boiling water.

In their continuing endeavor, these researchers and their international colleagues currently focus mainly on three major diseases: Sclerotinia stalk rot and head rot and downy mildew.   ""To develop new sunflower breeding lines with disease resistance, we rely heavily on genetic resources from wild sunflowers that evolved in their native North America,"" says ARS plant pathologist Thomas J. Gulya, of the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota.   The North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station—a joint venture among ARS, 12 agricultural experiment stations, and Iowa State University, in Ames—now provides a reservoir of 1,600 cultivated sunflower accessions (specimens) and more than 2,200 accessions of the 49 wild sunflower species from which scientists may draw for breeding experiments or research purposes.               Scientists like Gulya are typically unsung heroes. As diseases are controlled, the low incidence of epidemics tends to go unnoticed. For example, some 15 years ago, a single registered fungicide was so effective in controlling downy mildew that commercial plant breeders did not include mildew resistance among their top breeding priorities. During the past 2 years, however, ARS scientists at Fargo have found new fungicide-resistant strains of downy mildew. Anticipating resistance and continued evolution of other mildew races, Gulya and coworkers located new sources of mildew resistance and transferred the genes into agronomically acceptable germplasm. Now, new sunflower hybrids with USDA-bred resistance, combined with fungicides, may avert calamities.   The fungus  Sclerotinia  causes sunflower diseases that account for half of the disease-related yield losses in the Northern Great Plains. In some years these losses total $15 million. Sclerotinia stalk rot, the most significant sunflower disease in the United States, appears year in, year out, regardless of weather.   With neither chemical-control nor genetic-resistance weapons, the U.S. grower is nearly defenseless. ARS scientists have been searching for tolerance to the disease, both in cultivated breeding lines and in wild sunflowers, for the past two decades. Recent germplasm releases by the ARS team have given the sunflower industry its first sources of tolerance to Sclerotinia stalk rot.   Sclerotinia head rot occurs during wetter-than-normal growing seasons—like September 1999. More than 75 percent of the sunflower acreage in North Dakota had head rot, which not only caused substantial yield losses, but also contaminated the soil for many years. Whenever soil is highly contaminated with sclerotia, growers must rotate to a crop like wheat, which is prone to scab, instead of to other  Sclerotinia -susceptible broadleaf crops, such as soybeans, dry beans, or canola. ARS scientists had already been working with researchers in Argentina and France to find sources of resistance to head rot, but after the 1999 epidemic, head rot research became a much higher priority.—By  Ben Hardin,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

Kochian to thank. During 13 years of research at the U.S. Plant, Soil, and Nutrition Laboratory at Ithaca, New York, Kochian has become an authority on mechanisms used by certain plants to take up essential mineral nutrients and toxic heavy metals from soils. He has also characterized strategies some plants use to tolerate toxic soil environments. Kochian is an international expert on plant responses to environmental stress, plant mineral nutrition, and use of plants  W  SCOTT BAUER (K8783-1)  Could this be a job for soil-cleaning superplants? The lack of vegetation in the barren area above is a result of the soil's high zinc content and low pH.

Besides providing important new information on how to use plants in this practical way, Kochian's research may also shed light on an important nutritional concern: how to prevent toxic metals from entering the food chain. ""One of the primary ways toxic heavy metals, such as cadmium, get in food is through plant uptake--the metal is taken up by the roots and deposited in edible portions,"" he says. ""Contaminated soils and waters pose major environmental, agricultural, and human health problems worldwide,"" says Kochian. ""These problems may be partially solved by an emerging new technology--phytoremediation.""  ""Green"" Technology: Simple Concept and Cost-Effective Phytoremediation is the use of green plants to remove pollutants from the environment or render them harmless. ""Current engineering-based technologies used to clean up soils--like the removal of contaminated topsoil for storage in landfills--are very costly,"" Kochian says, ""and dramatically disturb the landscape."" Kochian's cost-effective ""green"" technology uses plants to ""vacuum"" heavy metals from the soil through their roots. He says, ""Certain plant species--known as metal hyperaccumulators--have the ability to extract elements from the soil and concentrate them in the easily harvested plant stems, shoots, and leaves. These plant tissues can be collected, Agricultural Research/June 2000   ""Thlaspi is a small, weedy member of the broccoli and cabbage family,"" Kochian says. ""It thrives on soils having high levels of zinc and cadmium."" His lab has been trying to discover the underlying mechanism that enables T. caerulescens to accumulate excessive amounts of heavy metals. How Plants Clean Up ""Hyperaccumulators like Thlaspi are a marvelous model system for elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of--and ultimately the genes that control--metal hyperaccumulation,"" says Kochian. ""These plants possess genes that regulate the amount of metals taken up from the soil by roots and deposited at other locations within the plant. ""There are a number of sites in the plant that could be controlled by different genes contributing to the hyperaccumulation trait,"" says Kochian. ""These genes govern processes that can increase the solubility of metals in the soil surrounding the roots as well as the transport proteins that move metals into root cells. From there, the metals enter the plant's vascular system for further transport to other parts of the plant and are ultimately deposited in leaf cells."" Kochian's team has gained insights into how, at the molecular level, Thlaspi accumulates these metals in its shoots at astoundingly high levels. ""A typical plant may accumulate about 100 parts per million (ppm) zinc and 1 ppm cadmium. Thlaspi can accumulate up to 30,000 ppm zinc and 1,500 ppm cadmium in its shoots, while exhibiting few or no toxicity symptoms,"" he says. ""A normal plant can be poisoned with as little as 1,000 ppm of zinc or 20 to 50 ppm of cadmium in its shoots.""  The research also suggests an approach for economically recovering these metals. ""Zinc and cadmium are metals that can be removed from contaminated soil by harvesting the plant's shoots and extracting the metals from them,"" he says. After investigating the molecular physiology of zinc hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi, Kochian's group found that several key sites for zinc transport were greatly stimulated in this plant. To get at the mechanism underlying the stimulation, they cloned a zinc transport gene--one of the first such accomplishments achieved with any plant. This breakthrough enabled the researchers to discover that zinc transport is regulated KEITH WELLER (K6054-9)  reduced in volume, and stored for later use."" While acting as vacuum cleaners, the unique plants must be able to tolerate and survive high levels of heavy metals in soils--like zinc, cadmium, and nickel. ""Phytoremediation has been hampered historically by our inadequate understanding of transport and tolerance mechanisms,"" says Kochian. To address this deficit, Kochian--working with ARS research associate Deborah L. Lethman, Cornell University postdoctoral associates Mitch Lasat and Paul B. Larsen, and graduate students Nicole S. Pence and Stephen D. Ebbs--has been studying a unique and promising metal hyperaccumulator. The plant is Thlaspi caerulescens, commonly known as alpine pennycress. Agricultural Research/June 2000  Alpine pennycress doesn't just thrive on soils contaminated with zinc and cadmium--it cleans them up by removing the excess metals. 5   SCOTT BAUER (K8782-1)  differently in normal and hyperaccumulator plants. ""In normal plants, the activity of zinc transporter genes is regulated by the zinc levels in the plant,"" he says. ""In Thlaspi, however, these genes are maximally active at all times--independent of plant zinc levels--until you raise the tissue zinc levels to very high concentrations. This results in very high rates of zinc transport from the soil and movement of this metal to the leaves."" It Even Works With Uranium For soil contaminated with uranium, Kochian found that adding the organic acid citrate to soils greatly increases both the solubility of uranium and its bioavailability for plant uptake and translocation. Citrate does this by binding to insoluble uranium in the soil. ""With the citrate treatment, shoots of test plants increased their uranium con-  Though the concept of phytoremediation is simple, progress is limited by the complexity of metal transport and tolerance mechanisms. Above, Cornell University research associate Miguel Pineros (left) and plant physiologist Leon Kochian study some of these mechanisms in corn.  Today's ""Phyto-miners"" Rush to the Cry of ""There's Metals in Them Thar Plants!"" Gold rush miners might have been better off using plants to find gold rather than panning streams for the precious metal. Early prospectors in Europe used certain weeds as indicator plants that signaled the presence of metal ore. These weeds are the only plants that can thrive on soils with a high content of heavy metals. One such plant is alpine pennycress, Thlaspi caerulescens, a wild perennial herb found on zinc- and nickel-rich soils in many countries. This plant occurs in alpine areas of Central Europe as well as in our Rocky Mountains. Most varieties grow only 8 to 12 inches high and have small, white flowers. In 1998, ARS agronomist Rufus L. Chaney and colleagues in ARS, at the University of Maryland, and in England patented a method to use such plants to ""phyto-mine"" nickel, cobalt, and other metals.

This demonstrates the possibility of using citrate--an inexpensive soil amendment--to help plants reduce uranium contamination. Recently, Kochian, with colleagues Lasat and Ebbs, identified specific agronomic practices and plant species to remediate soils contaminated with radioactive cesium or cesium-137. ""Although the cause of cesium-137 contamination--aboveground nuclear testing--has been reduced, large land areas are still polluted with radiocesium,"" Kochian says. ""Cesium is a longlived radioisotope with a half-life of 32.2 years. It contaminates soils at several U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites in the United States. Projected costs of cleaning up these soils is very high-- over $300 billion."" Phytoremediation is an attractive  Leon Kochian and ARS research associate Deborah Lethman study electrophoresis films to identify Thlaspi caerulescens genes responsible for heavy-metal transport.  alternative to current cleanup methods that are ener gy intensive and very expensive. In initial lab and greenhouse studies, Kochian's team showed that the primary limitation to removing cesium from soils with plants was its bioavailability. The form of the element made it unavailable to the plants for uptake. In a series of soil extraction studies, Kochian's team found the ammonium ion was most effective in dissolving cesium137 in soils. This treatment increased the availability of cesium-137 for root uptake and significantly stimulated radioactive cesium accumulation in plant shoots. Later, Kochian did field studies with six different plant species in collaboration with Mark Fuhrmann, a DOE scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. They found significant variation in the effectiveness of  Chaney says biomining is the use of plants to mine valuable heavy-metal minerals from contaminated or mineralized soils, as opposed to decontaminating soils. ""The crops would be grown as hay. The plants would be cut and baled after they'd taken in enough minerals,"" Chaney says. ""Then they'd be burned and the ash sold as ore. Ashes of alpine pennycress grown on a high-zinc soil in Pennsylvania yielded 30 to 40 percent zinc--which is as high as high-grade ore. Electricity generated by the burning could partially offset biomining costs."" USDA has signed a cooperative research and development agreement with Viridian Environmental, a technology company based in Houston, Texas. The CRADA involves Scott Angle at the University of Maryland; Alan J.M. Baker at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom; plant breeder YinMing Li with Viridian; and a cooperator at Oregon State University. Viridian is funding the CRADA's phyto-mining research and development to the tune of $1 million over 5 years.  Chaney says that to make phyto-mining as well as phytoremediation worthwhile requires, at a minimum, a plant with very high annual intake of minerals, such as the highcadmium-accumulating pennycress variety for which they have filed a patent application. ""Better still, the traits of plants like pennycress could be incorporated into a high-yielding commercial crop like canola grown for hay,"" Chaney says. His idea of the best hyperaccumulators? ""They'd have all the characteristics of a hay crop: They should be tall, high yielding, fast growing, easy to harvest, and deep rooted. And they should hold onto their mineral-rich leaves so they can be harvested along with the plant stems.""--By Don Comis, ARS. Rufus L.

""One species, a pigweed called Amaranthus retroflexus, was up to 40 times more effective than others tested in removing radiocesium from soil. We were able to remove 3 percent of the total amount in just one 3-month growing season,"" says Kochian. ""With two or three yearly crops, the plant could clean up the contaminated site in less than 15 years."" As a result of Kochian's findings, DOE is performing pilot studies at Brookhaven using this technology. Aluminum Hurts Crops Worldwide Kochian's lab is also working on finding ways to grow crops on marginal lands such as acid soils, where toxic levels of aluminum limit crop production. Aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust; it is a major component of clays in soil. At neutral or alkaline pH values, aluminum is not a problem for plants. 8  Leaves of Thlaspi caerulescens can accumulate levels of zinc and cadmium many times higher than leaves of most other plants.  Agricultural Research/June 2000   However, in acid soils a form of aluminum--Al+3--is solubilized into a soil solution that is quite toxic to plant roots. For years, scientists have been baffled by the causes of aluminum toxicity in plants. ""Aluminum toxicity limits crop production on acid soils, which cover well over half of the world's 8 billion acres of otherwise arable land, including about 86 million acres in the United States,"" Kochian says. ""When soils become acid, the toxic aluminum damages plant root systems, which greatly reduces yields."" Kochian's research in collaboration with ARS plant molecular biologist David F. Garvin uses an interdisciplinary approach integrating molecular, genetic, and physiological research to provide insights into how particular genetic types of some plant species--including wheat, corn, and sorghum--can tolerate high levels of the metal in acid soils. ""We found that the root tip is the key site of injury, leading to inhibited root growth, a stunted root system, and reduced yields or crop failures from decreased uptake of water and nutrients,"" Kochian says. ""Aluminum triggers the release of protective organic acids, specifically from the root tip into adjacent soil. When released, these acids form a complex with the toxic aluminum, preventing the metal's entry into the root. Wheat and corn tolerate aluminum by excluding the metal from the root tip,"" Kochian says. Kochian is also conducting research on an aluminum tolerance mechanism in collaboration with plant molecular biologist Steve H. Howell of Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell, using thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a diminutive, weedy member of the mustard family. He and colleagues have successfully identified Arabidopsis mutants that are aluminum tolerant. Kochian is studying differences between these mutants and a wild type of Arabidopsis to identify the molecular basis of tolerance. The ultimate goal of this research is Agricultural Research/June 2000  Phytoremediation:  Using Plants To Clean Up Soil  Leaves accumulate metals and are harvested to prevent soil recontamination.  Roots take up metals from contaminated soils and transport the metals to stems and leaves.  to isolate the genes conferring aluminum tolerance. It should then be possible to improve the tolerance of relatively aluminum-sensitive crop species, such as barley, or to further enhance the tolerance of existing aluminum-tolerant germplasm. ""One of the major goals for agricultural scientists for the immediate future is to increase food production to keep up with an ever-growing world population,"" Kochian says. ""As much of the world's best agricultural land is already under cultivation or is being lost to industrialization, there is increasing pressure for farmers to cultivate marginal lands such as the huge expanses of acid soils that are not currently used for production."" He continues, ""Research aimed at producing crop genotypes that tolerate the suboptimal conditions of these marginal lands is one way global food production can be increased significantly. Being able to produce a wider range of crop species with increased aluminum tolerance will make a major contribution to these efforts to cultivate marginal,  stressed soil environments."" Besides helping farmers who grow crops on acid soils, Kochian's phytoremediation research findings are used by other scientists in government and academia and by environmental consultants, government, and industry groups complying with cleanup of contaminated sites.

GX014-42-16535232	Report on the Status of the Sunflower Germplasm in the U.S.      Sunflower is one of the four most important annual oilseed crops grown for    edible oil. It is also the second largest hybrid crop grown in the world. U.S.    production in 1999 was estimated at 3.6 million acres with an estimated total    economic impact of $2.6 billion. The ultimate goal of the entire sunflower germplasm    effort is the enhancement and development of superior germplasm for the producer    to insure a continued and viable industry.        Present Germplasm Activities   The North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station, Ames, Iowa has the responsibility    for the maintenance and distribution of the sunflower germplasm collection.    Evaluation of the collection is being conducted by the Plant Introduction Station,    the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), State Universities/Experiment Stations,    and various cooperators around the world depending on the expertise and environments    needed to evaluate for various characteristics.      Status of Crop Vulnerability   Sunflower hybrids grown in the U.S. are based on a single male-sterile cytoplasm    derived from wild  Helianthus petiolaris  which makes them extremely    vulnerable. Hybrids are also vulnerable to many insect and disease pests.      Germplasm Needs: Collection   Sunflower is unique in that it is one of the four crop species which has its    progenitor species native to the U.S. The genus  Helianthus  contains    50 species and 15 subspecies which offer genetic diversity for many agronomic    characteristics for the improvement and expansion of cultivated sunflower. The    present germplasm collection is representative of all extant species and subspecies,    but does not come close to adequately representing the potentially available    genetic diversity that needs to be conserved. Continued efforts are needed to    strive toward collecting as many populations of all species as are feasible.    Since Mexico has not been systematically collected, this area represents a wealth    of genetic variation and should be collected as soon as possible. Due to the    persistent Sclerotinia disease complex, emphasis will be put on collecting selected    perennial species in the U.S. In the future, collections will be based on species    specific needs, instead of collecting all species from a general area.          Germplasm Needs: Maintenance   The seed multiplication program is the most valuable link of the  Helianthus     germplasm program. There is a critical need to regenerate and replenish wild     Helianthus  seed stocks. The number of accessions waiting to be regenerated    is large. Until accessions are regenerated, this produces a bottleneck in the    evaluation process. Due to the large number of wild perennial accessions waiting    to be regenerated, and the difficulty in obtaining an adequate number of plants    for regeneration, in situ conservation should be considered as a maintenance    option.      Germplasm Needs: Evaluation    An evaluation plan for disease and insect pests listing priorities for evaluation    is in place. Evaluation information obtained to date has been a valuable addition    to the GRIN system in characterizing the value of germplasm accessions. There    is a continued need to evaluate more accessions as pest races change and the    continuing need to evaluate additional species populations and accessions. Priority    descriptors of the accessions of the wild species continue to be collected in    an effort to make the information available in the GRIN system. There is a particular    need for additional funds to evaluate the wild perennial species for Sclerotinia    stem and stalk rots, and screening of wild species for Rhizopus head rot resistance,    a persistent and increasing problem in the High Plains.      Germplasm Needs: Enhancement   Increasing genetic variability of cultivated sunflower is critical for ensuring    survival of the crop. An enhancement plan is in place for the inclusion of wild     Helianthus  species into a domesticated background utilizing embryo    rescue and other techniques. The plan includes interspecific gene transfer,    germplasm pool development, and development of cytoplasmic male-sterility and    fertility restoration programs. Based on current needs, crossing wild perennial    species into the cultivated background is necessary since many of the perennial    species have shown promise as potential sources of genes for resistance to some    of the persistent pests. There is critical need to utilize the molecular characterization    techniques available to facilitate the difficult task of transferring genes    from the wild perennial species into cultivated sunflower.      Recommendations    The priority needs and actions for the  Helianthus  germplasm collection    are as follows:        Fund an exploration to explore the wealth of genetic variability in the      wild species of Mexico.      Provide funding to the Plant Introduction Station to build a greenhouse      complex to increase the number of accession regenerations that require special      conditions.       Provide $50,000 for evaluation of wild perennial species for resistance      to the  Sclerotinia  disease complex and wild species for  Rhizopus       head rot resistance.      Provide funding for a Category I scientist to facilitate the use of molecular      technology in the gene transfer from wild perennial species into cultivated      sunflower.      The Committee strongly supports the activities of the NPGS site at Parlier,      CA as an alternate grow-out site and encourages exploring the opportunities      to utilize it as an alternate site for difficult to regenerate sunflower accessions.

A hard-working native bee can sometimes top the pollination prowess of the domesticated honey bee—even when badly outnumbered. ""In our experiments using outdoor enclosures,"" says  ARS  entomologist Vincent J. Tepedino, ""sunflower leafcutting bees spread out evenly among sunflowers instead of visiting just the plants nearest their nesting boxes.""   Tepedino has affectionately nicknamed the bees ""megapugs,"" short for  Megachile pugnata.  They're native to southern Canada and most of the United States except the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast.   Dark-colored and about 3/4- to 1-inch-long, the bee forages on sunflowers and other species in the sunflower family. It uses leaf pieces and moistened soil to make partitions between compartments, or cells, that house its young.    ""Megapugs could be used wherever sunflowers are grown,"" Tepedino notes. ""They are charming and dutiful. Every sunflower grower should have a bunch.""  Tepedino used four 100-by-20-foot screened enclosures, owned by Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., at Woodland, California, for the experiment. One kind of sunflower produced significantly larger and heavier seeds after being pollinated by the megapugs than when pollinated by domesticated honey bees,  Apis mellifera.   The test was the first using sunflower leafcutting bees to pollinate hybrid sunflowers in field cages, says Tepedino. In earlier work, other ARS researchers at Logan, Utah—where Tepedino is based—scrutinized megapug performance in open fields. There, too, the bees were better than honey bees as outdoor pollinators of sunflowers.   In the new test, Tepedino enclosed bees within the four cages, each with about 600 sunflower plants inside. For around 2-1/2 weeks, about 100 sunflower bees in each of two cages performed pollination chores. Meanwhile, a few thousand domestic honey bees—over 10 times more than the megapugs—performed the same task in two other cages.   For one type of sunflower, there was no significant difference in the size of seeds harvested or the total seed weight per flower head. For the second kind of sunflower included in the experiment, however, those pollinated by the sunflower leafcutting bee produced seeds that were about 30 percent larger, on average, than seeds on plants pollinated by honey bees. Total seed weight per flower head was also about 30 percent greater.   Tepedino expects to have results of a follow-up study late this year or in early 2000.—By  Marcia Wood,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.    Vincent J.

Area  for  grain  harvest  is  unchanged  from  May  1  at  119,000 acres.   Yields  are  now  expected  to  average  60.0  bushels  per  acre,  down 3.0  bushels  from  the  May  1  forecast  but 2.0  bushels above  last  year.         Crop Report Summary, June 1, 2003, with Comparisons                   Crop       Unit       New York       United States          2001       2002       2003       2001       2002       2003                   1,000           Production             Winter wheat       bu.        6,360       7,424       7,140       1,361,479       1,142,802       1,563,314             NEW YORK MAPLE SYRUP PRODUCTION   DOWN 19 PERCENT                New York maple syrup 2003 production decreased 19 percent from 2002.  Syrup production is estimated at 210,000 gallons, down from the 260,000 gallons produced in 2002.  Only two states, Vermont and Maine, produced more syrup.         The number of taps, 1.34 million, decreased 5 percent from last year.  Syrup produced per tap averaged 0.157 gallons, down from 0.184 gallons in 2002.  The final value of the 2002 crop is $6.84 million.  Increased production from 2001 offset decreased prices.         Heavy snow cover made tapping trees and running tubing more difficult this  year.    Inconsistent  weather  early  in  the  spring  resulted   in  a late  maple  season  and  poor  sap  flow.   The  season  opened  on March 13 and closed on April 9.           Sap  was  slightly  below  average  for  sweetness,  requiring  an  average  of  44  gallons  to  make  one  gallon  of  syrup.   Syrup  quality was  64  percent  dark,  31  percent  medium,  and  5  percent  light. Favorable  temperatures  were  short  lived.  Temperatures  were reported  as  52  percent  too  warm,  14  percent  favorable,  and  34 percent  too  cold.   The  average  price  per  gallon  for  2002  syrup decreased  as  a  result  of  higher  bulk  sales  and  less  retail  sales.  In  addition  to  lower  bulk  prices,  retail  and  wholesale  container prices  were  also  generally  lower.

Prices  for  corn,  oats,  wheat,  soybeans,  and  apples  increased  while prices for barley, hay, and eggs decreased. Prices for wholesale milk were unchanged from April.         At the National level, the preliminary All Farm Products Index of Prices Received by Farmers in May is 107, based on 1990-92=100, up six points from the April Index.

Traditionally, farmers leave the soil bare every other year because there isnt enough water for an annual crop. The average rainfall in this area is only 16.5 inches a year.   With the help of research, however, farmers are increasingly finding ways to delay fallow to every third or fourth year.  They do this by leaving crop residues in place after harvest. This reduces evaporation and stores more precipitation in the soil for the next crop.  But crops need to be rotated to minimize disease and pest problems. Sunflowers could be one of these new crops for the central Great Plains, earning farmers money while protecting soil from blowing away in spring winds that easily exceed 30 miles per hour.  David C. Nielsen, an agronomist with the  Agricultural Research Service  in Akron, Colorado, finds that if sunflower stalks are left about 30 inches high after harvest, they almost completely prevent soil loss. When the inevitable winter blizzards arrive, the beheaded stalks act like snow fences, trapping 3 to 10 times more snow than would normally accumulate.   ""When this snow melts, it replenishes 3 to 9 inches of soil water,""  Nielsen says.  ""Depending on snowfall amounts and wind speeds, this can recharge about 30 to 95 percent of the water sunflowers use, making the practice worthwhile for farmers. They should earn more money, even when yields of wheat or other rotated crops are lower because of the water used by the sunflowers.""    Nielsen says sunflowers dry a soil out down to 6 feet in the Great Plains.  ""But that's good because as the sunflowers use the water that is too deep to be used by other crops, they also capture nitrogen, reducing chances of groundwater pollution.""   ""While wheat may dry a soil down to 8 percent moisture by volume, sunflowers dry it down to 3 or 4 percent,""  he says.  Nielsen has found that yields are best when sunflowers are rotated in every 4 years rather than every 3.  ""We think that's because growing sunflowers less frequently breaks disease and pest cycles. And without disease, there's a greater chance of the sunflower stalks standing up through the entire winter and next spring.""   Rotating in other crops like sunflowers also helps farmers diversify.    ""They're not so tied to weather conditions in a particular year,""  Nielsen says.  ""This year's a good example. There was a drought while winter wheat was growing. Then, wouldn't you know it, it rained as soon as the wheat was harvested, and rainfall was better than average when the sunflowers were planted and grown."" — By  Don Comis,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

The fungus ""Puccinia xanthii"" causes a rust disease on      cocklebur, and as such, it is referred to as ""cocklebur rust.""   Cocklebur  rust had been observed on sunflower in Australia in the late 1970's, but    has not been seen on sunflower in any other country since then, despite     the fact the fungus attacks cockelbur plants all over the world.   In       1999, spots were seen on cultivated sunflower in western North Dakota       which looked like cockelbur rust.  This was confirmed by microscopic        inspection.  The disease was found only in one field, and would not be      considered an economic problem.  The appearance of the disease, however,    should be noted, so that others may realize a ""new"" disease has been found  on sunflower, and it may be identified correctly.

""By the year 2001, U.S. acreage of oilseed sunflowers could  well double from its present 2.2 million,"" predicts Larry Kleingartner,  executive director of the National Sunflower Association (NSA).    Oils derived from the new hybrids have just the right composition to  make fried foods taste better and stay fresh longer than foods prepared in  oils from traditional sunflower hybrids,  Agricultural Research Service  scientists have found.    The new hybrids, collectively called NuSun, produce oil that's  several times higher in oleic acid than traditional sunflower oil. And it holds up  longer in frying vats--even without being hydrogenated.    NuSun oil's bright promise is recognized by a mid-oleic task force  organized by the NSA, which has been promoting commercialization. The task force  includes researchers, growers, and people in the seed, vegetable oil processing,  and food industries. NuSun hybrids are being grown on some 100,000 acres this  year.    In the United States, oilseed sunflowers are grown mostly in the  Northern and Central Great Plains. The crop produces about 440,000 tons of  vegetable oil, about 70 percent of which is exported.    ARS geneticist Jerry F. Miller and biochemist Brady A. Vick at  Fargo, North Dakota, found that a single, dominant gene ensures any number of  sunflower hybrids can be easily bred to produce oil that's in the mid-oleic range  60 to 75 percent oleic acid. In 2 years of tests, this range remained stable in  different  growing environments from North Dakota to Kansas.    Oleic acid is termed a monounsaturated fatty acid. Some studies have  indicated that a high proportion of fat as oleic acid in moderately  low-fat diets can lower serum cholesterol and the risk of coronary heart  disease.    Another nutritional asset, a rich vitamin E content already in  traditional sunflower hybrids, remains just as abundant in NuSun hybrids, according  to ARS tests in 1997.    So far, Miller and Vick have found that, through conventional  breeding, NuSun hybrids can be developed to produce oil with nearly 30 percent  less saturated fatty acids than traditional hybrids. Potato chips fried in  such oil could be labeled as ""Low in Saturated Fat,"" having less than  1 gram of saturated fat per 28.4-gram (1-ounce) serving.    To reduce saturated fat even further, the Fargo scientists have  produced some plants with mutations for low levels of palmitic acid and others  with low stearic acid levels. By crossing both of these mutant types with  established breeding lines, they have produced oil with a palmitic-stearic range of  6 to 9 percent, in contrast to 11 to 12 percent in traditional hybrids.    ""NuSun could become an exciting new venture in the oilseed  sunflower industry,"" says Curt Stern, field operations manager for the  sunflower division of Archer Daniels Midland Company at Enderlin, North Dakota.    ""If the entire U.S. snack food industry switches to NuSun oil,  it will need roughly 4 billion pounds a year--about 4 million acres of  cropland. And because mid-oleic oil requires no hydrogenation and is low in saturated  fats, fast foods and salad oils may also become large markets,"" says  Stern.    High-oleic sunflower oil has been a specialty oil since 1988.  However, the food industry mainly uses less expensive oils, like cottonseed and  partially hydrogenated soybean oil.      There's Lots To Recommend Them    Many seed companies have developed NuSun hybrids using genetic  resources released by ARS. These hybrids may provide a reliable supply of  mid-oleic NuSun oil to food industries, says Miller.     ""In field tests, we've shown that commercial NuSun and our  experimental hybrids are as good as traditional sunflowers in economic qualities  such as yield potential.""            By switching hybrids, farmers may see steadily increasing demand for  their crop at home and abroad. And if NuSun is successful, NSA's Kleingartner  says, each segment of the market chain should benefit. Among the big winners:  Health- and cost-conscious consumers and vegetable oil processors.     The costly processing step of bubbling hydrogen into polyunsaturated  oils--partial hydrogenation--won't be required to protect against  flavor deterioration. No hydrogenation means no formation of trans fatty acids  that some nutritionists claim may be unhealthful. Not common in plants,  trans fatty acids are geometrically altered forms of once polyunsaturated fatty  acids, like linoleic and linolenic, that had multiple places for hydrogen atoms to  bond, or saturate.    A commercial NuSun hybrid making its debut this year produces oil  that's about 65 percent oleic acid. The 69 percent linoleic acid content of  traditional sunflower oil was reduced to 26 percent, which means the new oil  doesn't have to be hydrogenated.    Linoleic acid is a key to giving fried foods their flavor. But even  with less linoleic acid, there's still enough for desired flavor in fried  foods, according to sensory panel evaluations at the ARS National Center     for Agricultural Utilization Research (NCAUR), Peoria, Illinois.     ""Tortilla chips fried in NuSun oil have a high intensity of  fried-food flavor,"" says NCAUR food technologist Kathleen Warner. With aging,  the NuSun chips stay fresh-tasting longer than chips fried in commercial  sunflower oil.    Snack food companies could benefit as consumers become repeat buyers  of flavor-stable chips, Warner says. The companies could benefit further  by not needing to replace used NuSun oils as frequently as they might more polyunsaturated frying oils. However, no simple test yet exists to  precisely compare the fry life of vegetable oils or to know when one should be  changed.     Many different compounds are formed when vegetable oils are heated,  explains Warner. Research at NCAUR on measuring these compounds is a step toward  learning their effects on flavor and could eventually lead to benchmarks for  determining when to replace oil in a deep fryer.    Moreover, at frying temperatures, NuSun oil produces lower  intensities of off-odors. Sunflower oil, until now, has often been blended with  cottonseed oil to ensure a pleasing fried-food aroma.--By   Ben  Hardin,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.    Jerry F.

Races of broomrape have been      identified and sources of resistance appear to have stabilized sunflower    production in Eastern European countries, but racial evolution of           broomrape in Spain has been very rapid during the past few years in Spain,  and all resistance has been overcome.  In order to find resistance to a     highly virulent population of broomrape, three sets of cultivated plant     material were tested in Spain, including 160 USDA breeding lines.  Of       these lines, 5% were completely resistant and 19% segregated for            resistance.  These lines trace back to crosses of two USDA restorer lines   with Russian, Turkish and Romanian hybrids.  Also, origin of PI accessions  from the USDA Plant Introduction Station at Ames, IA, that segregated for   resistance were primarily derived from the former USSR and from Romania.    Cooperative efforts between the USDA and CIDA in Spain will continue to     identify resistant lines to new races of broomrape.

Scientists Collar Mystery Sunflower       Pest   By  Jan     Suszkiw     February 1, 2002        Agricultural Research       Service  scientists in Fargo, N.D., may have found the mystery culprit       behind unsightly blemishes that began turning up on confection sunflower seeds       in 1998.         At first, the prime suspect was a species of disease-causing        Alternaria  fungus, a common pathogen of sunflower crops. But studies by       ARS scientists Thomas Gulya and Laurence Charlet with the agency’s        Northern Crop Science       Laboratory  in Fargo exonerated the fungus. When they sprayed sunflower       plants with fungicide and then examined the seeds later in the season, many       still harbored spots, otherwise known as kernel brown spot. When the plants       were sprayed with insecticide, however, the incidence of blemishes dropped       sharply.         Acting on a tip from commercial growers who reported an insect       damaging nearby canola crops, Gulya and Charlet focused their attention on the       Lygus bug. Its main claim to fame is pestering cotton, even though dozens of       crops can serve as hosts. In the Northern Great Plains, where sunflowers are       king, the bug’s mischief has primarily been confined to alfalfa and canola       crops--or so it was thought.        To find out, Gulya and Charlet conducted greenhouse experiments       in which Lygus bugs were placed on sunflower seedheads. They then sealed cloth       bags around the seedheads to confine the insects. Checks of the seeds at       maturity revealed tell tale brown spots identical to those seen in field-grown       seeds. The spots caused by Lygus bug feeding are most likely the result of       digestive enzymes the pest injects to extract nutrients.        For growers who produce sunflowers for the confectionary snack       market, such damage can doom seed harvests to a less profitable outlet:       birdseed. A longer story about the scientists’ detective work appears in       the  February        issue of  Agricultural Research  magazine on the World Wide Web.

GX039-71-2519214	TEKTRAN   REGISTRATION OF TEN INTERSPECIFIC GERMPLASMS DERIVED FROM WILD PERENNIAL SUNFLOWER      Author(s):    SEILER  GERALD J                         Interpretive Summary:    Wild sunflowers are the ancestors of cultivated sunflower.  The ancestors   possess considerable variability for many morphological and physiological   traits.  The problem is that many of the species are very distant           relatives of the cultivated sunflower so the breeding of the wild           relatives with cultivated sunflower can be difficult.  Wild perennial       sunflower are the most distantly related ancestors,  but are a  good        potential source of genes for pest resistance for cultivated sunflower.     Efforts to utilize many of these species are hampered by poor germination,  crossability and sterility problems, and culturing difficulties.            Development of interspecific breeding materials which overcome many of      these problems would greatly facilitate the use of the wild perennial       species.  Ten interspecific germplasm lines have been developed which       contain genes transferred from four different perennial species.  The       germplasm lines exhibit an annual growth habit, varying degrees of          branching, and lower oil content than cultivated hybrids.  Utilization of   these germplasm lines in sunflower breeding programs has the potential of   increasing the genetic diversity for pest resistance and decreasing the     genetic vulnerability of cultivated sunflower.

GX040-96-10094148	TEKTRAN   PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A SEARCH FOR SUNFLOWER MIDGE ATTRACTANTS      Author(s):    VICK  BRADY A                            Interpretive Summary:    The sunflower midge was first discovered in 1971 and was identified as the  cause of serious damage to the heads of cultivated sunflower in North       Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.  Symptoms were severe gnarling of the    heads or cupping, resulting in reduced seed set and in the worst case,      complete loss of seed set.  Although the sunflower midge is distributed     throughout the Great Plains growing region of cultivated sunflower, it has  only been a serious economic pest in the northern production area of North  and South Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. This study aimed to establish  whether sunflower heads emit volatile compounds that attract the sunflower  midge.  Such compounds would serve as kairomones, compounds beneficial to   the midge but harmful to the sunflower.  In one experiment sunflower bud    volatile compounds were used in an insect trap.  However, the trap          attracted several insect species, and a control trap with water was just    as effective as the trap containing sunflower volatile compounds.  In a     second experiment using an olfactometer, adult sunflower midge were         attracted down a tube to a young sunflower bud, suggesting that they were   sensitive to a chemical cue from the sunflower bud.  Although this          experiment needs to be repeated, the initial results indicate the possible  role of a volatile chemical attractant that guides the sunflower midge to   a young sunflower bud.  Further research is underway to repeat the          experiment and establish whether or not this hypothesis is correct.  If     chemical attractants of the sunflower midge can be identified, it may be    possible to use them to monitor the severity of midge infestations, or as   a means to control their populations.

GX041-17-0686806	"TEKTRAN   FIRST REPORT OF CROSS-INFECTIVITY OF PLASMOPARA HALSTEDII FROM MARSHLEDER TO SUNFLOWER      Author(s):    GULYA JR  THOMAS J                       Interpretive Summary:    The same fungus that causes ""downy mildew"" on sunflower is reported to      infect many different genera of ornamental flowers and weeds in the         ""Composite"" family.  In very few instances, however, has anyone tried to    see if the fungus causing mildew on these other plants able to infect       sunflower.   This summer, we found the weed marshelder with downy mildew    symptoms.  Spores taken from the weed were able to infect cultivated        sunflower and cause typical mildew symptoms.  This proves that common       North Dakota weeds, such as marshelder and cocklebur, may serve as          ""reservoirs"" for the downy mildew fungus which can then infect sunflower.   Thus, weed control in fields and ditches is important in managing this      sunflower disease, especially since the fungus has recently developed       resistance to the chemical seed treatment (APRON) that has been the main    protection for the sunflower crop.

GX041-27-16660181	TEKTRAN   POLLEN GERMINATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER SPECIES      Author(s):    SEILER  GERALD J                   OLSON  MARJORIE A                        Interpretive Summary:    Improvement of cultivated sunflower can takes place at several levels. One  is making selections at the pollen level using large pollen populations to  increase the frequency of desirable genes.  This would allow breeders an    opportunity to shorten the selection and breeding process. Investigations   have shown that genes imparting resistance to many biotic and abiotic       stresses such as herbicides, salinity, low temperature, and phytotoxins are expressed in the pollen.  A requisite for using pollen is being able to     germinate pollen grains for selection to various stresses. The wild         sunflower species, the ancestors of the cultivated sunflower, offer a vast  genetic resource for improving the sunflower crop, but lack a reliable      method of pollen germination. Research was conducted to determine the       optimum germination medium and germination technique for wild sunflowers.   Preliminary results indicated that macerated stigmas of a cytoplasmic       sterile line in a pollen germination medium with polyethylene glycol was    effective in germinating fresh pollen of the wild species. It was much less effective on pollen stored under cold conditions for four months. Germinat- ion of wild species did not approach 100% indicating that a single pollen   germination technique may not be applicable for all wild species. Stigmas   from other cytoplasmic male sterile sources also may be more effective than the one used in the present study. The influence of pollen and stigma       sources on pollen germination, whether stigmas can be stored, and the       optimum storage conditions need further investigation. The ability to       increase pollen germination of some of the wild species gives us the        opportunity to explore the sunflower ancestors for desirable traits for     improving cultivated sunflower.

So a couple of years ago, when sunflower farmers began seeing mysterious brown spots on the blunt end of their seeds,  Agricultural Research Service  scientists answered a call for help.Were the spots caused by a disease? An insect? Or both?     An answer and a solution to the problem remain crucial because farmers who produce sunflower seeds for the confection market end up selling the seeds for birdseed at low prices if more than 0.5 percent have the condition called kernel brown spot. Last year, the spots were found in 7 percent of seed samples from some fields.     ""At first, we considered the type of fungus called  Alternaria  as a prime suspect,"" says ARS plant pathologist Thomas J. Gulya, of the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota.     But Gulya and ARS entomologist Laurence D. Charlet exonerated the fungus and are now pointing at the lygus bug, also known as the tarnished plant bug. It's an insect whose notoriety has been associated largely with cotton, but hundreds of crops serve as hosts. In the Northern Great Plains, the quarter-inch-long lygus bugs thrive on increasing acreages of canola. Other tasty crops in the region include sugarbeets, safflower, buckwheat, and crambe.     Scientists at North Dakota State University are working with the ARS scientists to compare lygus bug populations in sunflower fields planted next to certain other crops. ""So far, we've observed that sunflower, being a late-seeded or late-maturing crop, serves as a host plant for second-generation lygus bugs,"" says Charlet.     Though lygus bugs don't eat much—probably not enough to reduce sunflower crop yields—they have the nasty habit of injecting plant tissues, such as the developing seeds, with digestive enzymes and extracting nutrients with their pointy little mouthparts. The microscopic injuries thwart development of surrounding tissue and appear as big brown spots after the seed matures and is marketed and hulled.     In greenhouse studies, the scientists found kernel brown spot only in seeds from flowers they had covered with bags containing lygus bugs. In USDA insecticide trials at four sites, researchers found less severe kernel brown spot where the plants had been sprayed well before harvest time with insecticides used to control the banded sunflower moth and the seed weevil. The same insecticides kill lygus bugs. To start learning what steps to take and when best to take them to minimize kernel brown spot, the scientists set up several types of experiments last summer.     The confectionery sunflower market has grown rapidly in recent years to sales in multimillions of dollars involving China alone.
