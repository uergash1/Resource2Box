Interesting Facts about the Korean Language                     Korean is the official language of North and South Korea.           Divided into multiple dialects, the primary dialect of South Korea is based on           the local dialect of Seoul, while the primary dialect of North Korea is based           on the local dialect of Pyongyang. Diversity between dialects is minor, with           most being mutually intelligible- the primary difference between them being the           use of stress. On the other hand, the small island of             Jeju  (pop. 550,000), off the southern coast of Korea, has a unique and           largely unintelligible dialect. Many Korean linguists consider it to be a           different language altogether.                    Korean largely utilizes Honorifics, or the use of special nouns           or verb endings to specify the subjects social status (similar to Japanese).           Verbs are not conjugated as in European languages, but are modified for tense           and also relationship between the people speaking. The use of Honorifics must           be paid attention to closely when translating in Korean. Improper use could           insult your audience.                    History of the Korean Language           Korean is commonly thought to be in a family of its own (not           closely related to other languages). Some believe it to be part of the Altaic           languages and many Japanese linguists consider it to be closely related to           Japanese. Due to the diverse landscapes, islands and mountain regions of Asia,           it is not uncommon to have language-isolates such as Korean and Japanese in           geographically isolated regions. Although one can easily see the similarities           between Korean and Chinese, they are only superficial (the two languages are           not related). Close contact between the two nations over thousands of years has           resulted in great influence over both the Korean spoken language and writing           systems long after the Korean language was developed.                    Written Language                    Due to its geographical proximity to China, Koreas writing           system, like many others, began as a borrowing of the Chinese writing system to           record the local spoken language. Chinese characters ( Hanja )           were used to write Korean based on both pronunciation and meaning, leading to a           complex system more often used by the rich and elite.                    It wasnt until the middle of the 15th century that King Sejong           ordered a group of scholars to create the  Hangul  writing           system, an alphabet ( Jamo ) consisting of 10 vowels and 14           consonants which are written in blocks of 2-5 letters.                    The Korean Alphabet (Hangul)           In the example below, you can see that the korean word for           Hangul is comprised 2 character blocks which are then made from 3 letters ( Jamo           ) each.             =      +               +                             and       +                +                         Hangul did not become popular until the mid 20th century.           Today, like with Japanese, Hanja (Chinese characters) is still used           side-by-side with Hangul. Today, well over 50% of Korean vocabulary is made up           of Sino-Korean words, derived from Chinese characters. Modern terminology is           usually derived from Japanese and European languages such as English and           German.           Unlike Chinese and Japanese, Korean is written with spaces in           between words and punctuation marks are used similarly to European languages.           Like with Chinese and Japanese, modern Korean has left the old style of writing           top-to-bottom, right-to-left in favor of the more western left-to-right system.                               Interesting Facts About Korean                     "" Chinese words are still considered prestigious and elite           within the Korean Language, primarily due to the rich literal history            generally recorded in the Hanja script.                    "" South Korea still uses Hanja in its writing. North Korea has           completely eliminated Hanja.                    "" Jamo consonants were designed to illustrate the general           morphology of the mouth and throat for that sound. Vowels were designed to           represent mans place on earth under heaven.                    "" Like Japanese and Chinese, Korean can still be correctly           written top-to-bottom,  right-to-left.                    "" South Korea has a 98% literacy rate.

The language is also spoken   widely in neighbouring Yanbian, China. Worldwide, there are around 78 million   Korean speakers, including large groups in the former Soviet Union, the United   States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, and more recently the Philippines. The language   is strongly associated with the Korean people. Czech translation services: translate from Czech into Korean, translate from Korean into Czech, Korean translator                      The genealogical   classification of Korean is debated. It is sometimes placed by linguists in the   Altaic language family, though others considered it to be a language isolate.   Korean is agglutinative in its morphology and SOV in its syntax.

Sino-Korean   characters, or hanja, are also used in writing. While the most commonly used   words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the   vocabulary consists of words composed from hanja.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         OUR SERVICES                                              You can order our translation services from/into Korean in our  quotation page  or just filling in contact form on the left side of the page.                                                                                                                      WE TRANSLATE                                                                   Arabic                       Azerbaijanian                       Armenian                       Belarusan                       Bulgarian                       Chinese                       Croatian                       Czech                       Danish                       Dutch                       English                       Estonian                       Finnish                       French                       German                       Georgian                       Greek                       Hebrew                       Hungarian                     Italian                             Japanese                  Kazakh                 Korean                 Latvian                 Lithuanian                 Macedonian                 Mongolian                 Norwegian                 Persian                   Polish                 Portuguese                 Romanian                 Russian                 Serbian                 Slovak                 Slovenian                 Spanish                 Swedish                 Turkish                 Ukrainian                                                                   USEFUL LINKS                                  Online dictionaries                                                                                                                                    We translate into:                                Korean-Arabic                  Korean-Azerbaijanian                  Korean-Armenian                  Korean-Belarusan                  Korean-Bulgarian                  Korean-Chinese                  Korean-Croatian                  Korean-Czech                  Korean-Danish                  Korean-Dutch                  Korean-English                  Korean-Estonian                  Korean-Finnish                  Korean-French                  Korean-German                  Korean-Georgian                  Korean-Greek                  Korean-Hebrew                  Korean-Hungarian                  Korean-Italian                  Korean-Japanese                   Korean-Kazakh                  Korean-Latvian                  Korean-Lithuanian                  Korean-Macedonian                  Korean-Mongolian                  Korean-Norwegian                  Korean-Persian                  Korean-Polish                  Korean-Portuguese                  Korean-Romanian                  Korean-Russian                  Korean-Serbian                  Korean-Slovak                  Korean-Slovenian                  Korean-Spanish                  Korean-Swedish                  Korean-Turkish                  Korean-Ukrainian                                                                                             ABOUT   |   SERVICES   |   REFERENCE   |   INFORMATION   |   PRICE LIST   |   CAREER   |   ORDER   |   CONTACT US                                                               © 2006 IVEX Central s.r.o.

Korean Translators                            About the Korean Language     Korean Language (한국어) is spoken on the Korean Peninsula (North  and South Korea) and also on the mainland of Asia in the Yanbian-Korean Autonomous  Prefecture of China. It is also spoken by the Korvo-saram in territory that was  once part of the USSR. About 78 million people speak Korean world-wide, with large  concentrations in North and South America, Australia, China, Japan and the Philippines.     The written language is now called “Hangui,” which evolved from    borrowed characters of Chinese origin (called Hanja) and then molded by Sejong    the Great in the 15th century into the current writing system. Korean is not    a tonal language, like Chinese, and, unlike Chinese, it uses phonetic characters    rather than ideographs to express words. The alphabet has 14 consonants and    8 vowels. Unlike Chinese and Japanese, Korean uses spaces between words and    punctuation much like European languages. Traditionally it was written top-to-bottom,    right-to-left, but in modern times is written like Western languages.   In the South, the spoken language is most often called  Hangungmal     or  Hangugeo , which means ""national language."" In the North    and in Yanbian China it is called  Chosŏnmal     or  Chosŏnŏ . The Koryo-saram call    it Goryeomal or “Korean language.” Korean is spoken in approximately    nine different dialects, the most prominent of course, being those of Seoul    and Pyongyang.   Grammatically, Korean is ""agglutinative,” meaning that it handles    grammatical functions by adding on prefixes, suffixes and word particles, rather    than making internal changes to the root word. The sentence structure is basically    “subject-object-verb,” unlike most Western languages.   Korean, like Japanese and many other Asian tongues, pays close attention to    the relationship of the speaker with the person spoken to and with the person    spoken about. The forms used for those “spoken about” are called    honorifics (like ""her royal highness"" when speaking of the queen).    The forms used for those ""spoken to"" (the audience) are called speech    levels. Korean has many special nouns and honorific verb suffixes for indicating    superiority of the object of the sentence over the status of the speaker. There    are also seven different speech levels, each with its own distinctive grammar,    ranging from common at the bottom to a high level of formality at the top. More    formal speech levels are used as a sign of respect.   Over half of the words in the Korean vocabulary can be traced to Chinese origin,    particularly those relating to abstractions. While many came from written Chinese,    several were created in Japan or in Korea, but expressed with Chinese characters.    Korean uses both an indigenous numbering system and also one based on Chinese    numerals. In modern times, many words have come into Korean from European languages    as well.

In 1827 Josip Kompare decided to take the New Year's idea to heart and make some changes in his life. Along with the painted charicatures he whipped up and displayed, he wrote various cynical poems and satirical scientific proclamations and read them publicly. The event gathered steam from there, each year becoming more ornate and exciting. Before you knew it Josip's seemingly silly musings had become a ritual - one that people all over the country take part in at the beginning of February. The bonfire:  A bonfire is stoked up on the first day of the festival and gets the sin-purging for all those who participate into high-gear. Hooray! Burning Prince Faanik:  On the last day of the ceremonies, a Prince Faanik doll is set ablaze to signal its successful conclusion. Let's set the story straight - the precious prince is not a real person and never was, thus you shoudn't think the thrilled participants barbaric. Sraco the judge:  A local raven-like bird people look to as a kind of wisened muse and judge (like Yoda) descends upon the region and proclaims it the 'Samobor Faanik Republic of Freedom' immediately following the Faanik's incineration. This act seals the deal. Even if you wanted your guilt and sin back too bad - Srako has laid down the law. Warning: Srako won't appear unless all acts are completed in the appropriate manner. Why the masks?  It's a carnival silly, if you must know. Part of the process is dressing up as though  you were an animal or pervert and as always, the odder the final result the better. The idea is freedom, one borne of the fact that your identity is concealed.

Insider trading is the practice of purchasing shares in your own company. In accordance with the Security and Exchange Commission the purchaser must file within a few days of the transaction. Filings can be found on the SEC's edgar page. Insider trading is an important tool for value based investors. Insiders have a better understanding of their company, if nothing else they have seen the faces of people at the office, heard the chatter in the lunch room- they have a feel.  Insiders are like any other investor- they sell for all sorts of reasons but only buy stock for one reason. When insiders speak we should all listen. But are all insiders created equally? Well for fun I took all of the titles of insiders: CEO, CFO, CTO and compared their performance since 2003. I am looking for a few things: A low standard deviation in the role. (very, very, very important) Some titles are handed out like candy and making conclusions when you have two roles acting completely differently does not seem to serve much purpose. A high minimum return every quarter. (very, very important) I want a consistence of returns, 30% up followed by 30% down scares me. A high median return every quarter. (important) In the same what that I like consistent returns I would like to get what I can. A high max return every quarter. (a little important) I like to see a solid return just like the next guy. I won't post all of my results here for each role, but here are the top 5:           officertitle     STD     Min     Median     Max           CHAIR       0.09     4.80%     22.08%     34.94%           TREASURER       0.10     5.56%     18.83%     39.36%           CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD       0.08     1.74%     16.79%     31.37%           HUMAN RESOURCES     0.11     8.35%     19.11%     41.58%           BOARD MEMBER     0.12     2.09%     25.42%     60.85%                 Posted by   value investor                   Labels:   insider trading                                Printer Friendly     Share:                                                                                                                      0 comments:                                    Post a Comment                                       Newer Post         Older Post       Home           Subscribe to:   Post Comments (Atom)                                         Translate this page into                      Language  Arabic  Bulgarian  Catalan  Chinese (Simplified)  Chinese (Traditional)  Croatian  Czech  Danish  Dutch  Filipino  Finnish  French  German  Greek  Hebrew  Hindi  Indonesian  Italian  Japanese  Korean  Latvian  Lithuanian  Norwegian  Polish  Portuguese  Romanian  Russian  Serbia  Slovak  Slovenian  Spanish  Swedish  Ukrainian  Vietnamese                             Subscribe via email      To receive new entries by email please enter your email address:   (No spam privacy policy)                                          Posts                                                                             Atom                                                           Posts                         Comments                                                                             Atom                                                           Comments                                         Blog Archive                ▼       2009                                 (7)                                    ▼       January                                 (7)                                   Easy ways to Make Money: Secretary Calls         Easy ways to Make Money: Investor Calls         Buy What you Know: A Recipe for Investing in Tough...

Make it your career!               Karthik Tirupathi   E nglish has been the  de facto  standard for business executives the world over for many decades now. However due to the rise of Asian giants like China, Japan  [ Images ]  and India this is set to change. Coupled with globalisation and adoption of the internet in all spheres of life this change is further likely to accelerate.    A quick look at the internet users in the picture below shows that only 36.5 per cent of user demand English as the medium of communication on the information highway in 2005! While no recent statistics are available the author is fairly confident that internet would have only gotten better for non-English speakers in the meantime.   Which language pairs must I choose?   A quick look at the report from Google further strengthens the argument that this will be a century where CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and FIGS (French, Italian, German, Spanish) dominate the internet in general and business communications specifically.

After the Islamic conquest of  the Persian Sassanian Empire in 642 AD, Arabic became the language of  government, culture and especially religion.    Modern Persian appeared during the 9th century. It is written in a version  of the Arabic script and is full of words of Arabic origin. There are also  two methods of writing Persian with the Latin alphabet.    Under Mongolian and Turkish rulers, Persian was adopted as the language  of government in Turkey, central Asia and India, where it was used for  centuries, and until after 1900 in Kashmir.    Persian is a member of the Iranian branch of Indo-European languages.  There are a number of closely-related varieties of Persian, including:    Persian  ( فارسی ),  is spoken by about 40 million people, mainly in central and south central Iran.  There are a further 2 million speakers in many other countries including  Bahrain, Iraq, Oman, Yemen, the UAE and the USA.    Dari  ( درى )  is spoken by about 7 million people in Afghanistan and Pakistan.    Tajiki  (Тоҷики /   تاجيكى ) is spoken  in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Ukraine  by about 4.4 million people.      Persian, Farsi or Parsi?   The official language of Iran is sometimes called Farsi in English and other  languages. This is a correct transliteration of the native name of the language,  however many, including the  ISO  and the   Academy of Persian Language and Literature ,  prefer the name Persian for the language. Some speakers use the older local name:  Parsi (پارسی). There is some discussion about this topic at:   www.iranian.com  and   wikipedia .    Iran or Persia?   Until 1935, the official name of the country currently known as Iran  was Persia, though the Persian people have called their country Iran  since the Sassanid period (226 - 651 AD). There's further discussion about  this at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_naming_dispute     Persian alphabet (الفبای فارسی) and pronunciation              Listen to recording of the Persian alphabet by Bahaareh Asghari  ( بهاره اصغرى )     Numerals       Note   The symbols for 4,5 and 6 are different from the standard numerals used for   Arabic .

The chart below shows the letters used to write UniPers, toghether with  their equivalent Persian letters.        Pársik   Pársik or IPA2 (International Persian Alphabet) is another method of  writing Persian with the Latin alphabet developed recently, mainly by A. Moslehi,  a comparative linguist.
