The temporary registration shall be valid for a period of sixty days from the date of issuance by the department of revenue to the purchaser of the vessel or from the date of sale of the vessel by a dealer from which the purchaser obtains a certificate of registration.  The temporary certificate of registration shall be issued on a form prescribed by the department of revenue and issued only for the purchaser's use in the operation of the vessel purchased to enable the purchaser to legally operate the vessel while a certificate of registration is being obtained, and shall be displayed on no other vessel.  Temporary certificates of registration issued under this section shall not be transferable or renewable and shall not be valid upon issuance of a proper certificate of registration.  The dealer or authorized agent shall insert the date of issuance and expiration date, year, make and the manufacturer's identification number of the vessel on the temporary registration when issued to the purchaser.  The dealer shall complete the information on the temporary registration in full.

Such certificate of decibel level from the manufacturer shall be given by the dealer to the purchaser of the new motorboat if the motorboat is sold for use upon the waters of this state.  The purchaser shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the certificate of decibel level which shall be supplied by the dealer.

For the purpose of races or racing events, such race shall only be sanctioned when conducted in accordance with and approved by the United States Coast Guard or this state.        7.  Any officer authorized to enforce the provisions of this section who has probable cause to believe that a motorboat is not in compliance with the noise levels established in this section may direct the operator of such motorboat to submit the motorboat to an on-site test to measure noise levels, with the officer on board if such officer chooses, and the operator shall comply with such request.  The owner of any motorboat which violates any provision of this section shall have sixty days from the date of the violation to bring the motorboat into compliance with the provisions of this section.  Thereafter, it shall be the owner's responsibility to have the motorboat tested by the state water patrol.  If the motorboat fails the state water patrol test, the owner shall immediately moor the motorboat and shall keep the motorboat moored until the state water patrol certifies that the motorboat is in compliance with the provisions of this section.  Any person who fails to comply with a request or direction of an officer made pursuant to this subsection is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the officer's ability to enforce this section and to issue citations to the owner or operator of any motorboat during the sixty-day compliance period.        8.  Any officer who conducts motorboat sound level tests as provided in this section shall be qualified in motorboat noise testing by the department of public safety.  Such qualifications shall include but may not be limited to the selection of the measurement site, and the calibration and use of noise testing equipment in accordance with the testing procedure prescribed by SAE J2005 and SAE J34.        9.

As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:        (1)  ""Marine sanitation device"", any equipment on board a vessel which is designed to receive, retain, treat or discharge sewage, and any process to treat sewage on board.  Marine sanitation device includes:        (a)  Type I marine sanitation device, which produces an effluent having a fecal coliform bacteria count of not greater than one thousand per one hundred milliliters and no visible floating solids;        (b)  Type II marine sanitation device, which produces an effluent having a fecal coliform bacteria count not greater than two hundred per one hundred milliliters and suspended solids not greater than one hundred fifty milligrams per liter; and        (c)  Type III marine sanitation device, which is certified to a no- discharge standard, including recirculating and incinerating marine sanitation devices and holding tanks;        (2)  ""Sewage"", human body wastes, and the wastes from toilets and other receptacles intended to retain body waste;        (3)  ""Vessel"", every description of watercraft, other than a seaplane on the water, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water;        (4)  ""Y valve"", a device capable of diverting the flow of marine sewage so that a vessel's marine sanitation device is bypassed and raw sewage is discharged directly into the water.        2.  The following vessels equipped with an installed toilet shall be equipped with an operable marine sanitation device:        (1)  A vessel sixty-five feet in length and under shall have a type I, II or III marine sanitation device; or        (2)  A vessel over sixty-five feet in length shall have a type II or III marine sanitation device.        3.  (1)  A type I or II marine sanitation device shall have a certification label affixed that at a minimum shows:        (a)  The name of the manufacturer;        (b)  The name and model number of the device;        (c)  The month and year of manufacture;        (d)  The marine sanitation device type;        (e)  A certification number; and        (f)  A certification statement;        (2)  A type III marine sanitation device is automatically certified and requires no label, provided it stores sewage and flushwater only at ambient air temperature and pressure.        4.  While a vessel with an installed toilet is on Missouri waters, the operator shall ensure that:        (1)  All pathways for overboard discharge of vessel sewage from any vessel with a type III marine sanitation device are blocked or secured in such a way as to prevent any accidental or intentional vessel sewage discharge, by disconnecting or physically blocking the onboard sewage lines or hull fittings which would allow for overboard vessel sewage discharge; and        (2)  Any installed in-line Y valve shall be secured to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage from any vessel utilizing a type III marine sanitation device, by bypassing, locking, securing or disabling the valve using a padlock or nonreusable wire tie wrap, or by removal of the valve handle, or by any other method in accordance with federal regulations and standards or as approved or required by the Missouri state water patrol.        5.  The chosen compliance method pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of this section shall totally eliminate the possibility of overboard vessel sewage discharge while in waters of the state.  The method chosen shall present a physical barrier to the use of the Y valve, whether accidental or intentional, so that use of the valve cannot occur without the knowledge of the operator of the vessel.        6.  For any vessel offered as a noncaptained charter, the leasing entity shall:        (1)  Ensure that the vessel complies with this section when presented to the lessor; and        (2)  Include the lease agreement, signed by the leasing party, a paragraph outlining the operator's responsibilities pursuant to this section.        7.

(L. 1998 H.B. 1161  1)                Effective 6-9-98       Liens and encumbrances--valid, perfected, when, how, future advances--boats and motors subject to, when, how determined--revenue to establish security procedure, electronic notices, rulemaking authority.          306.400.  1.  As used in sections 306.400 to 306.440, the terms ""motorboat"", ""vessel"", and ""watercraft"" shall have the same meanings given them in section 306.010, and the term ""outboard motor"" shall include outboard motors governed by section 306.530.        2.  Unless excepted by section 306.425, a lien or encumbrance on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft shall not be valid against subsequent transferees or lienholders of the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft, who took without knowledge of the lien or encumbrance unless the lien or encumbrance is perfected as provided in sections 306.400 to 306.430.        3.  A lien or encumbrance on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft is perfected by the delivery to the director of revenue of a notice of lien in a format as prescribed by the director.  Such lien or encumbrance shall be perfected as of the time of its creation if the delivery of the items required in this subsection to the director of revenue is completed within thirty days thereafter, otherwise such lien or encumbrance shall be perfected as of the time of the delivery.  A notice of lien shall contain the name and address of the owner of the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft and the secured party, a description of the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft motor, including any identification number, and such other information as the department of revenue may prescribe.  A notice of lien substantially complying with the requirements of this section is effective even though it contains minor errors which are not seriously misleading.  Provided the lienholder submits complete and legible documents, the director of revenue shall mail confirmation or electronically confirm receipt of each notice of lien to the lienholder as soon as possible, but no later than fifteen business days after the filing of the notice of lien.        4.  Liens may secure future advances.  The future advances may be evidenced by one or more notes or other documents evidencing indebtedness and shall not be required to be executed or delivered prior to the date of the future advance lien securing them.  The fact that a lien may secure future advances shall be clearly stated on the security agreement and noted as ""subject to future advances"" in the second lienholder's portion of the notice of lien.  To secure future advances when an existing lien on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft does not secure future advances, the lienholder shall file a notice of lien reflecting the lien to secure future advances.  A lien to secure future advances is perfected in the same time and manner as any other lien, except as follows.  Proof of the lien for future advances is maintained by the department of revenue; however, there shall be additional proof of such lien when the notice of lien reflects such lien for future advances, is receipted for by the department of revenue, and returned to the lienholder.        5.  Whether an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft is subject to a lien or encumbrance shall be determined by the laws of the jurisdiction where the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft was when the lien or encumbrance attached, subject to the following:        (1)  If the parties understood at the time the lien or encumbrances attached that the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft would be kept in this state and it is brought into this state within thirty days thereafter for purposes other than transportation through this state, the validity and effect of the lien or encumbrance in this state shall be determined by the laws of this state;        (2)  If the lien or encumbrance was perfected pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction where the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft was when the lien or encumbrance attached, the following rules apply:        (a)  If the name of the lienholder is shown on an existing certificate of title or ownership issued by that jurisdiction, his or her lien or encumbrance continues perfected in this state;        (b)  If the name of the lienholder is not shown on an existing certificate of title or ownership issued by the jurisdiction, the lien or encumbrance continues perfected in this state for three months after the first certificate of title of the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft is issued in this state, and also thereafter if, within the three-month period, it is perfected in this state.  The lien or encumbrance may also be perfected in this state after the expiration of the three-month period, in which case perfection dates from the time of perfection in this state;        (3)  If the lien or encumbrance was not perfected pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction where the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft was when the lien or encumbrance attached, it may be perfected in this state, in which case perfection dates from the time of perfection in this state;        (4)  A lien or encumbrance may be perfected pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision (2) or subdivision (3) of this subsection in the same manner as provided in subsection 3 of this section.        6.  The director of revenue shall by rules and regulations establish a security procedure to verify that an electronic notice or lien or notice of satisfaction of a lien on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft given pursuant to sections 306.400 to 306.440 is that of the lienholder, to verify that an electronic notice of confirmation of ownership and perfection of a lien given pursuant to section 306.410 is that of the director of revenue and to detect error in the transmission or the content of any such notice.  Such a security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures or similar security devices.  Comparison of a signature on a communication with an authorized specimen signature shall not by itself constitute a security procedure.

All certificates of title of an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft issued by the director of revenue shall be mailed to the owner named therein.  If the certificate of ownership is being held electronically by the director of revenue at the election of a lienholder, then confirmation of such ownership shall be electronically transmitted or mailed to the first lienholder named in such certificate.        2.  A lienholder may elect to have the director of revenue retain possession of an electronic certificate of title and the director shall issue regulations to govern the procedure for making such an election. Each such certificate of title shall require a separate election unless the director provides otherwise by regulation.  A subordinate lienholder shall be bound by the election of the superior lienholder with respect to the certificate involved.        3.  ""Electronic certificate of title"" means any electronic record of ownership, including liens that may be recorded.

If an owner creates a lien or encumbrance on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft:        (1)  The owner shall immediately execute the application, either in the space provided therefor on the certificate of title or on a separate form the director of revenue prescribes, to name the lienholder on the certificate of title, showing the name and address of the lienholder and the date of his or her security agreement, and shall cause the certificate of title, the application and the required fee to be mailed or delivered to the director of revenue.  Failure of the owner to do so is a class A misdemeanor;        (2)  The lienholder or an authorized agent licensed pursuant to sections 301.112 to 301.119, RSMo, shall deliver to the director of revenue a notice of lien as prescribed by the director accompanied by all other necessary documentation to perfect a lien pursuant to section 306.400;        (3)  To perfect a lien for a subordinate lienholder when a transfer of ownership occurs, the subordinate lienholder shall either mail or deliver, or cause to be mailed or delivered, a completed notice of lien to the department of revenue, accompanied by authorization from the first lienholder.  The owner shall ensure the subordinate lienholder is recorded on the application for title at the time the application is made to the department of revenue.  To perfect a lien for a subordinate lienholder when there is no transfer of ownership, the owner or lienholder in possession of the certificate shall either mail or deliver, or cause to be mailed or delivered, the owner's application for title, certificate, notice of lien, authorization from the first lienholder and title fee to the department of revenue.  The delivery of the certificate and executing a notice of authorization to add a subordinate lien does not affect the rights of the first lienholder under the security agreement;        (4)  Upon receipt of the documents and fee required in subdivision (3) of this section, the director of revenue shall issue a new certificate of title containing the name and address of the new lienholder, and mail the certificate of title to the owner named in it or if a lienholder has elected to have the director of revenue retain possession of an electronic certificate of title, the lienholder shall either mail or deliver to the director a notice of authorization for the director to add a subordinate lienholder to the existing certificate as prescribed in section 306.405. Upon receipt of such authorization and a notice of lien from a subordinate lienholder, the director shall add the subordinate lienholder to the certificate of title being electronically retained by the director and provide confirmation of the addition to both lienholders.

A lienholder may assign, absolutely or otherwise, his or her lien or encumbrance on the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft to a person other than the owner without affecting the interest of the owner or the validity or effect of the lien or encumbrance, but any person without notice of the assignment is protected in dealing with the lienholder as the holder of the lien or encumbrance and the lienholder shall remain liable for any obligations as lienholder until the assignee is named as lienholder on the certificate of title.        2.  An assignee pursuant to subsection 1 of this section may, but need not to perfect the assignment, have the certificate of title issued with the assignee named as lienholder, upon delivering to the director of revenue the certificate of title, an assignment by the lienholder named in the certificate of title, and the required fee in the form the director of revenue prescribes.        3.  If the certificate of title is being electronically retained by the director of revenue, the original lienholder may mail or deliver a notice of assignment of lien to the director in a form prescribed by the director.  Upon receipt of notice of assignment, the director shall update the electronic certificate of title to reflect the assignment of lien and lienholder.

Upon the satisfaction of a lien or encumbrance on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft, the lienholder shall within ten days execute a release of his or her lien or encumbrance, on the certificate or separate document, and mail or deliver the certificate or separate document to the owner or any person who delivers to the lienholder an authorization from the owner to receive the documentation.  The release on the certificate or separate document shall be notarized.  Each perfected subordinate lienholder, if any, shall release such lien or encumbrance as provided in this section for the first lienholder.  The owner may cause the certificate of title, the release, and the required fee to be mailed or delivered to the director of revenue, who shall release the lienholder's rights on the certificate and issue a new certificate of title.        2.  If the electronic certificate of title is in the possession of the director of revenue, the lienholder shall notify the director within ten business days of any release of lien and provide the director with the most current address of the owner.  The director shall note such release on the electronic certificate and if no other lien exists, the director shall mail or deliver the certificate free of any lien to the owner.        3.

(4) Claim of weight allowance to which a horse is not entitled shall not disqualify unless protest is made in writing and lodged with stewards at least one (1) hour before post time.    (5) No horse shall incur a weight penalty or be barred from any race for having been placed second or lower in any race; nor shall a horse be given a weight allowance for failure to finish second or lower in any race.    (6) No horse shall receive allowance of weight nor be relieved of extra weight for having been beaten in one (1) or more races, but this rule shall not prohibit maiden allowances or allowances to horse that have not won a race within a specified period or a race of a specified value.    (7) In determining eligibility, allowances and penalties, the reports, records, and statistics as published in the Daily Racing Form and the monthly chart books, or corresponding official publications of any foreign country, shall be considered.    (8) Horses winning races at unrecognized meetings shall not be penalized for such winnings in races run thereafter under the jurisdiction of the commission.

He shall carry over to the scales all pieces of equipment with which he weighed out.    (14) Each jockey shall weigh in at the same weight as that at which he weighed out, and if short of it by more than two (2) pounds, his mount shall be disqualified.    (15) No jockey shall weigh in at more than two (2) pounds over the weight at which he weighed out, except insofar as said weight may have been affected by the elements.    (16) If a jockey is prevented from riding his mount to the finish line because of an accident or illness either to himself or his horse, he may walk or be carried to the scales, or he may be excused by the stewards from weighing in.

GX242-39-5712692	"New York State Department of Taxation and Finance  Taxpayer Services Division Technical Services Bureau  TSB-M-93 (4) R Mortgage Recording Taxes  1993 Amendments to the Mortgage Recording Taxes On August 4, 1993, Chapter 613 of the Laws of 1993 was enacted. Chapter 613 amended several laws in relation to reverse mortgage loans, including Article 11 of the Tax Law, the tax on mortgages (the mortgage recording taxes). The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize the provisions of Chapter 613 which affect Article 11. With respect to Article 11, Chapter 613 adds new subdivision two to section 252-a of the Tax Law to provide that the recording of reverse mortgages, which conform to the provisions of new sections two hundred eighty or two hundred eighty-a of the Real Property Law as added by Chapter 613, are exempt from each mortgage recording tax imposed or authorized to be imposed by Article 11 of the Tax Law. New sections two hundred eighty and two hundred eighty-a of the Real Property Law relate to reverse mortgage loans made to mortgagors 60 years of age or older or 70 years of age or older, respectively. For purposes of establishing entitlement to this exemption, the following documentation is required to be submitted to the recording officer at the time the reverse mortgage is offered for recording: a) for a mortgage made pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred eighty of the Real Property Law, an affidavit, made in duplicate, signed by the mortgagee, setting forth (1) that such mortgage is a reverse mortgage given by a mortgagor or mortgagors who are at least 60 years of age, (2) the mortgage is on real property improved by a one-to-four-family dwelling or condominium unit that is the residence of the mortgagor or mortgagors and (3) such mortgage conforms to all other provisions of section two hundred eighty of the Real Property Law; or for a mortgage made pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred eighty-a of the Real Property Law, an affidavit, made in duplicate, signed by the mortgagee, setting forth that (1) such mortgage is a reverse mortgage given by a mortgagor or mortgagors who are at least 70 years of age, (2) the mortgage is on real property improved by a one-to-four-family dwelling or condominium unit that is the residence of the mortgagor or mortgagors and (3) such mortgage conforms to all other provisions of section two hundred eighty-a of the Real Property Law.  b)  TP-9 (9/88)   -2TSB-M-93 (4) R Mortgage Recording Taxes  Where a reverse mortgage that conforms to the provisions of section two hundred eighty or section two hundred eighty-a of the Real Property Law is presented for recording without the documentation described in a) or b) above being furnished, the mortgage recording taxes will be imposed. However, the principal debt or obligation that is the measure of such taxes shall be the proceeds of the reverse mortgage loan that the lender is obligated to lend the borrower at the time of execution of the reverse mortgage or at any time thereafter but determined without regard to any contingency relating to the addition of any unpaid interest to principal or relating to the lenders' entitlement to a percentage of the future appreciation of the real property. In addition, Chapter 613 provides that where such a reverse mortgage is recorded without the required documentation, and if subsequent to the recording of such mortgage, the proceeds that the lender is obligated to lend the borrower are increased and an instrument is recorded to evidence the increase, mortgage recording taxes must be paid, measured by the amount of such increase. However, if at the time of the recording of such additional instrument, the documentation described in a) or b) of this memorandum is presented to the recording officer, the recording of the additional instrument will be exempt from the mortgage recording taxes. Also, Chapter 613 amends subdivision 2 of section 253-b of the Tax Law to provide that for purposes of such section, ""credit line mortgage"" shall not include a reverse mortgage made pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred eighty or two hundred eighty-a of the Real Property Law. Effective Date Chapter 613 takes effect on December 2, 1993 and the provisions relating to Article 11 of the Tax Law shall apply to mortgages recorded on or after such date."

GX256-15-10587075	"CONTINUING CARE CONTRACT STATUTES State of California Health and Safety Code Chapter 10 of Division 2 January 1, 2003 CHAPTER 10. CONTINUING CARE CONTRACTS  Article 1. General Provisions 1770. Legislative Intent. The Legislature finds, declares, and intends all of the following: (a) Continuing care retirement communities are an alternative for the long-term residential, social, and health care needs of California's elderly residents and seek to provide a continuum of care, minimize transfer trauma, and allow services to be provided in an appropriately licensed setting. (b) Because elderly residents often both expend a significant portion of their savings in order to purchase care in a continuing care retirement community and expect to receive care at their continuing care retirement community for the rest of their lives, tragic consequences can result if a continuing care provider becomes insolvent or unable to provide responsible care. (c) There is a need for disclosure concerning the terms of agreements made between prospective residents and the continuing care provider, and concerning the operations of the continuing care retirement community. (d) Providers of continuing care should be required to obtain a certificate of authority to enter into continuing care contracts and should be monitored and regulated by the State Department of Social Services. (e) This chapter applies equally to for-profit and nonprofit provider entities. (f) This chapter states the minimum requirements to be imposed upon any entity offering or providing continuing care. (g) Because the authority to enter into continuing care contracts granted by the State Department of Social Services is neither a guarantee of performance by the providers nor an endorsement of any continuing care contract provisions, prospective residents must carefully consider the risks, benefits, and costs before signing a continuing care contract and should be encouraged to seek financial and legal advice before doing so. 1771.

(a) No resident of any continuing care retirement community shall be deprived of any civil or legal right, benefit, or privilege guaranteed by law, by the California Constitution, or by the United States Constitution solely by reason of status as a resident of a community. In addition, because of the discretely different character of residential living unit programs that are a part of continuing care retirement communities, this section shall augment Chapter 3.9 (commencing with Section 1599), Section 73523 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, and applicable federal law and regulations.

(b) The Legislature encourages continuing care retirement communities to exceed the minimum resident participation requirements established by this section by, among other things, the following: (1) Encouraging residents to form a resident association, and assisting the residents, the resident association, and its governing body to keep informed about the operation of the continuing care retirement community. (2) Encouraging residents of a continuing care retirement community or their elected representatives to select residents to participate as board members of the governing body of the provider. (3) Quickly and fairly resolving any dispute, claim, or grievance arising between a resident and the continuing care retirement community.

If a multifacility organization elects to have one representative for every three communities that the provider operates, the provider shall provide to the president of the residents association of each of the communities that do not have a resident representative, the same notice of board meetings, board packets, minutes, and other materials as the resident representative. At the reasonable discretion of the provider, information related to litigation, personnel, competitive advantage, or confidential information that is not appropriate to disclose, may be withheld. 15   (k) In order to encourage innovative and alternative models of resident involvement, a resident selected pursuant to subdivision (i) to participate as a resident representative to the provider's governing body may, at the option of the resident association, be selected in any one of the following ways: (1) By a majority vote of the resident association of a provider or by a majority vote of a resident-elected committee of residents of a multifacility organization. (2) If no resident association exists, any resident may organize a meeting of the majority of the residents of the continuing care retirement community to select or nominate residents to represent them before the governing body. (3) Any other method designated by the resident association. (l) The resident association, or organizing resident, or in the case of a multifacility organization, the resident-elected committee of residents, shall give residents of the continuing care retirement community at least 30 days' advance notice of the meeting to select a resident representative and shall post the notice in a conspicuous place at the continuing care retirement community.

In addition, a resident representative shall be permitted to attend meetings of the board committee or committees that review the annual budget of the facility or facilities and recommend increases in monthly care fees. The resident shall receive the same notice of committee meetings, information packets, minutes, and other materials as committee members, and shall be permitted to attend, speak at, and participate in, committee meetings. Resident representatives shall perform their duties in good faith and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. (n) Notwithstanding subdivision (m), the governing body may exclude resident representatives from its executive sessions and from receiving board materials to be discussed during executive session. However, resident representatives shall be included in executive sessions and shall receive all board materials to be discussed during executive sessions related to discussions of the annual budgets, increases in monthly care fees, indebtedness, and expansion of new and existing continuing care retirement communities. (o) The provider shall pay all reasonable travel costs for the resident representative. (p) The provider shall disclose in writing the extent of resident involvement with the board to prospective residents.

In the event the amount of a provider's liquid reserve is insufficient, the provider shall prudently eliminate the deficiency by increasing its assets qualifying under Section 1792.2. (d) The department may increase the amount a provider is required to hold as its liquid reserve or require that a provider immediately place its liquid reserve into an escrow account meeting the requirements of Section 1781 if the department has reason to believe the provider is any of the following: (1) Insolvent. (2) In imminent danger of becoming insolvent. (3) In a financially unsound or unsafe condition. (4) In a condition such that it may otherwise be unable to fully perform its obligations pursuant to continuing care contracts.  63   1792.1. Special Rules. (a) For providers that have voluntarily and permanently discontinued entering into continuing care contracts, the department may allow a reduced liquid reserve amount if the department finds that the reduction is consistent with the financial protections imposed by this article. The reduced liquid reserve amount shall be based upon the percentage of residents at the continuing care retirement community who have continuing care contracts. (b) For providers holding a certificate of authority as of January 1, 2001, the liquid reserve requirement described in Section 1792 shall be phased in over the 24-month period following January 1, 2001. A provider holding a certificate of authority shall comply with the liquid reserve requirements if all of the following apply: (1) During the first 12 months following January 1, 2001, the provider holds as its liquid reserve, qualifying assets that equal or exceed 25 percent of the provider's debt reserve obligation; plus qualifying assets that equal or exceed 25 percent of the provider's operating expense reserve obligation. (2) During the 13th through 24th months following January 1, 2001, the provider holds as its liquid reserve, qualifying assets that equal or exceed 50 percent of the provider's debt reserve obligation; plus qualifying assets that equal or exceed 50 percent of the provider's operating expense reserve obligation. (3) After the 24 months following January 1, 2001, the provider holds as its liquid reserve qualifying assets in the amount required by Section 1792. (c) Providers who are unable to satisfy the debt service reserve or operating expense reserve requirements during the 24-month period described in subdivision (b) may apply to the department for an extension of the time to comply with those reserve requirements. The department shall grant a one-year extension request to a provider upon its showing that an extension is necessary and consistent with protecting the financial soundness of the provider. 1792.2. Qualifying Assets. (a) A provider shall satisfy its liquid reserve obligation with qualifying assets. Qualifying assets are: (1) Cash. (2) Cash equivalents as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (c) of Section 1771. (3) Investment securities, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (i) of Section 1771. (4) Equity securities, including mutual funds, as defined in paragraph (7) of subdivision (e) of Section 1771. (5) Lines of credit and letters of credit that meet the requirements of this paragraph. The line of credit or letter of credit shall be issued by a state or federally chartered financial institution approved by the department or whose long-term debt is rated in the top three long-term debt rating categories by either Moody's Investors Service, Standard and Poor's Corporation, or a recognized securities rating agency acceptable to the department. The 64   line of credit or letter of credit shall obligate the financial institution to furnish credit to the provider. (A) The terms of the line of credit or letter of credit shall at a minimum provide both of the following: (i) The department's approval shall be obtained by the provider and communicated in writing to the financial institution before any modification. (ii) The financial institution shall fund the line of credit or letter of credit and pay the proceeds to the provider no later than four business days following written instructions from the department that, in the sole judgment of the department, funding of the provider's minimum liquid reserve is required. (B) The provider shall provide written notice to the department at least 14 days before the expiration of the line of credit or letter of credit if the term has not been extended or renewed by that time. The notice shall describe the qualifying assets the provider will use to satisfy the liquid reserve requirement when the line of credit or letter of credit expires. (C) A provider may satisfy all or a portion of its liquid reserve requirement with the available and unused portion of a qualifying line of credit or letter of credit. (6) For purposes of satisfying all or a portion of a provider's debt service reserve requirement described in Section 1792.3, restricted assets that are segregated or held in a separate account or escrow as a debt service reserve under the terms of the provider's long-term debt instruments are qualifying assets, subject to all of the following conditions: (A) The assets are restricted by the debt instrument so that they may be used only to pay principal, interest, and credit enhancement premiums. (B) The provider furnishes to the department a copy of the agreement under which the restricted assets are held and certifies that it is a correct and complete copy. The provider, escrow holder, or other entity holding the assets must agree to provide to the department any information the department may request concerning the debt service reserve it holds. (C) The market value, or guaranteed value, if applicable, of the restricted assets, up to the amount the provider must hold as a debt reserve under Section 1792.3, will be included as part of the provider's liquid reserve. (D) The restricted assets described in this paragraph will not reduce or count towards the amount the provider must hold in its liquid reserve for operating expenses. (7) For purposes of satisfying all or a portion of a provider's operating expense reserve requirement described in Section 1792.4, restricted assets that are segregated or held in a separate account or escrow as a reserve for operating expenses, are qualifying assets subject to all of the following conditions: (A) The governing instrument restricts the assets so that they may be used only to pay operating costs when operating funds are insufficient. (B) The provider furnishes to the department a copy of the agreement under which the assets are held, certified by the provider to be a correct and complete copy. The provider, 65   escrow holder, or other entity holding the assets shall agree to provide to the department any information the department may request concerning the account. (C) The market value, or the guaranteed value, if applicable, of the restricted assets, up to the amount the provider is required to hold as an operating expense reserve under Section 1792.4, will be included as part of the provider's liquid reserve. (D) The restricted assets described in this paragraph shall not reduce or count towards the amount the provider is required to hold in its liquid reserve for long-term debt. (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the assets held by the provider as its liquid reserve may not be subject to any liens, charges, judgments, garnishments, or creditors' claims and may not be hypothecated, pledged as collateral, or otherwise encumbered in any manner. A provider may encumber assets held in its liquid reserve as part of a general security pledge of assets or similar collateralization that is part of the provider's long-term capital debt covenants and is included in the provider's long-term debt indenture or similar instrument. 1792.3. Debt Service Reserve; Amount. (a) Each provider shall include in its liquid reserve a reserve for its long-term debt obligations in an amount equal to the sum of all of the following: (1) All regular principal and interest payments, as well as credit enhancement premiums, paid by the provider during the immediately preceding fiscal year on account of any fully amortizing long-term debt owed by the provider. If a provider has incurred new long-term debt during the immediately preceding fiscal year, the amount required by this paragraph for that debt is 12 times the provider's most recent monthly payment on the debt. (2) Facility rental or leasehold payments, and any related payments such as lease insurance, paid by the provider during the immediately preceding fiscal year. (3) All payments paid by the provider during the immediately preceding fiscal year on account of any debt that provides for a balloon payment. If the balloon payment debt was incurred within the immediately preceding fiscal year, the amount required by this paragraph for that debt is 12 times the provider's most recent monthly payment on the debt made during the fiscal year. (b) If any balloon payment debt matures within the next 24 months, the provider shall submit with its annual report a plan for refinancing the debt or repaying the debt with existing assets. (c) When principal and interest payments on long-term debt are paid to a trust whose beneficial interests are held by the residents, the department may waive all or any portion of the debt service reserve required by this section. The department shall not waive any debt service reserve requirement unless the department finds that the waiver is consistent with the financial protections imposed by this chapter.  66   1792.4. Operating Expense Reserve Amount. (a) Each provider shall include in its liquid reserve a reserve for its operating expenses in an amount that equals or exceeds 45 days' net operating expenses. For purposes of this section: (1) Forty-five days net operating expenses shall be calculated by dividing the provider's operating expenses during the immediately preceding fiscal year by 365, and multiplying that quotient by 45. (2) ""Net operating expenses"" includes all expenses except the following: (A) The interest and credit enhancement expenses factored into the provider's calculation of its long-term debt reserve obligation described in Section 1792.3. (B) Depreciation or amortization expenses. (C) An amount equal to the reimbursement paid to the provider during the past 12 months for services to residents other than residents holding continuing care contracts. (D) Extraordinary expenses that the department determines may be excluded by the provider. A provider shall apply in writing for a determination by the department and shall provide supporting documentation prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (b) A provider that has been in operation for less than 12 months shall calculate its net operating expenses by using its actual expenses for the months it has operated and, for the remaining months, the projected net operating expense amounts it submitted to the department as part of its application for a certificate of authority. 1792.5. Reporting; Certification of Compliance. (a) The provider shall compute its liquid reserve requirement as of the end of the provider's most recent fiscal year end based on its audited financial statements for that period and, at the time it files its annual report, shall file a form acceptable to the department certifying all of the following: (1) The amount the provider is required to hold as a liquid reserve, including the amounts required for the debt service reserve and the operating expense reserve. (2) The qualifying assets, and their respective values, the provider has designated for its debt service reserve and for its operating expense reserve. (3) The amount of any deficiency or surplus for the provider's debt service reserve and the provider's operating expense reserve. (b) The provider shall also complete the same form and file it with the department within 45 days following the conclusion of each quarter during the provider's fiscal year. For each quarterly report, the amount the provider is required to designate for its debt reserve and operating expense reserve shall be based on the provider's audited financial statements for its most recently completed fiscal year. (c) For the purpose of calculating the amount held by the provider to satisfy its liquid reserve requirement, all qualifying assets used to satisfy the liquid reserve requirement shall be valued at their fair market value as of the end of the provider's most recent quarter. Restricted assets that have guaranteed values and are designated as qualifying 67   assets under paragraph (6) or (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1792.2 may be valued at their guaranteed values. 1792.6. Refund Reserve; Escrow Required; Amount. (a) Any provider offering a refundable contract, or other entity assuming responsibility for refundable contracts, shall maintain a refund reserve in trust for the residents. The amount of the refund reserve shall be revised annually by the provider and the provider shall submit its calculation of the refund reserve amount to the department in conjunction with the annual report required by Section 1790. This reserve shall accumulate interest and earnings and shall be invested in any of the following: (1) Qualifying assets as defined in Section 1792.2. (2) Real estate, subject to all of the following conditions: (A) To the extent approved by the department, the trust account may invest up to 70 percent of the refund reserves in real estate that is both used to provide care and housing for the holders of the refundable continuing care contracts and is located on the same campus where these continuing care contract holders reside. (B) Investments in real estate shall be limited to 50 percent of the providers' net equity in the real estate. The net equity shall be the book value, assessed value, or current appraised value within 12 months prior to the end of the fiscal year, less any depreciation, and encumbrances, all according to audited financial statements acceptable to the department. (b) Each refund reserve trust shall be established at an institution qualified to be an escrow agent. The escrow agreement between the provider and the institution shall be in writing and include the terms and conditions described in this section. The escrow agreement shall be submitted to and approved by the department before it becomes effective. (c) The amount to be held in the reserve shall be the total of the amounts calculated with respect to each individual resident holding a refundable contract as follows: (1) Determine the age in years and the portion of the entry fee for the resident refundable for the seventh year of residency and thereafter. (2) Determine life expectancy of that individual based on all of the following rules: (A) The following life expectancy table shall be used in connection with all continuing care contracts: Age 55 56 57 58 59 60 Females 26.323 25.526 24.740 23.964 23.199 22.446 Males 23.635 22.863 22.101 21.350 20.609 19.880 68 Age 83 84 85 86 87 88 Females 7.952 7.438 6.956 6.494 6.054 5.613 Males 6.269 5.854 5.475 5.124 4.806 4.513   Age 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82  Females 21.703 20.972 20.253 19.545 18.849 18.165 17.493 16.832 16.182 15.553 14.965 14.367 13.761 13.189 12.607 12.011 11.394 10.779 10.184 9.620 9.060 8.501  Males 19.163 18.457 17.764 17.083 16.414 15.759 15.116 14.486 13.869 13.268 12.676 12.073 11.445 10.830 10.243 9.673 9.139 8.641 8.159 7.672 7.188 6.719  Age 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110  Females 5.200 4.838 4.501 4.175 3.862 3.579 3.329 3.109 2.914 2.741 2.584 2.433 2.289 2.152 2.022 1.899 1.784 1.679 1.588 1.522 1.500 1.500  Males 4.236 3.957 3.670 3.388 3.129 2.903 2.705 2.533 2.384 2.254 2.137 2.026 1.919 1.818 1.723 1.637 1.563 1.510 1.500 1.500 1.500 1.500  (B) If there is a couple, the life expectancy for the person with the longer life expectancy shall be used. (C) The life expectancy table set forth in this paragraph shall be used until expressly provided to the contrary through the amendment of this section. (D) For residents over 110 years of age, 1.500 years shall be used in computing life expectancy. (E) If a continuing care retirement community has contracted with a resident under 55 years of age, the continuing care retirement community shall provide the department with the methodology used to determine that resident's life expectancy. (3) For that resident, use an interest rate of 6 percent or lower to determine from compound interest tables the factor that, when multiplied by one dollar ($1), represents the amount, at the time the computation is made, that will grow at the assumed compound interest rate to one dollar ($1) at the end of the period of the life expectancy of the resident. (4) Multiply the refundable portion of the resident's entry fee amount by the factor obtained in paragraph (3) to determine the amount of reserve required to be maintained. 69   (5) The sum of these amounts with respect to each resident shall constitute the reserve for refundable contracts. (6) The reserve for refundable contracts shall be revised annually as provided for in subdivision (a), using the interest rate, refund obligation amount, and individual life expectancies current at that time. (d) Withdrawals may be made from the trust to pay refunds when due under the terms of the refundable entrance fee contracts and when the balance in the trust exceeds the required refund reserve amount determined in accordance with subdivision (c). (e) Deposits shall be made to the trust with respect to new residents when the entrance fee is received and in the amount determined with respect to that resident in accordance with subdivision (c). (f) Additional deposits shall be made to the trust fund within 30 days of any annual reporting date on which the trust fund balance falls below the required reserve in accordance with subdivision (c) and the deposits shall be in an amount sufficient to bring the trust balance into compliance with this section. (g) Providers who have used a method previously allowed by statute to satisfy their refund reserve requirement may continue to use that method.  70   Article 6.5.  Actuarial Study Requirement  1792.11. Actuarial Study. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (a) In continuing care contracts, providers offer a wide variety of living accommodations and care programs for an indefinite or extended number of years in exchange for substantial payments by residents over the term of the contract. (b) The annual reporting and reserve requirements for continuing care providers should address a provider's long-term solvency. The past statutes establishing reserve requirements did not satisfactorily address this issue. (c) One method for comprehensively assessing a continuing care provider's long-term solvency, that may have significant potential benefits for residents, providers, and the department, is an actuarial study performed in compliance with Actuarial Standards of Practice Number 3 as adopted by the Actuarial Standards Board. (d) The continuing care statutes should, during a test period sufficient to apply the actuarial study requirement to all appropriate providers, require those providers to obtain and file with the department an actuarial study. (e) Fundamental to the effectiveness of actuarial studies are the assumptions used to project costs and revenues, as well as the breadth of the data base from which many of the assumptions are derived. For this and other reasons, neither the issues that will arise during the department's management of the actuarial study requirement nor the immediate impact of the actuarial study requirement on the continuing care industry can be fully anticipated. (f) In the context of the foregoing, it is in the public's interest that: (1) The statutes applicable to continuing care retirement communities require all providers, with certain exceptions, to conduct a one-time comprehensive assessment of their long-term solvency and to report that assessment to the department. (2) The statutes applicable to continuing care retirement communities implement a four-year trial program that requires specified continuing care providers, and applicants for a certificate of authority, to conduct an actuarial study. (3) The stability and longevity of the continuing care industry not be threatened by the four-year test program or dissemination by the department of any provider's actuarial study within four years of the filing date for the actuarial study. (4) During a four-year trial period, the department, as well as provider and resident representatives, assess the effectiveness of using actuarial studies to analyze the longterm financial viability of the providers in California. 1792.12. Trial Program. (a) The department shall implement in conformance with this article a four-year trial program for examining, and reporting on, the long-term solvency of specified continuing care providers. 71   (b) Under the program, the department shall require providers to obtain an actuarial study conducted in compliance with the Actuarial Standards of Practice Number 3 and then to file their actuarial study with the department. (c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the four-year trial program shall do both of the following: (1) Allow the department to consider the effectiveness and role of actuarial studies in the department's discharge of its obligation to assess each provider's financial soundness. (2) Allow providers, the department, and resident representatives to evaluate the actuarial study requirement, including the reliability of actuarial studies and their value if statutorily included in the regimen of continuing care providers' financial reporting and disclosure obligations. (d) The department shall, during the four-year period following the filing due date for a provider's actuarial study required under this article, maintain the confidentiality of the actuarial study. (e) The department's responsibility to manage the four-year trial program and review the providers' actuarial studies under this article represents a significant burden on its resources dedicated to its oversight of the continuing care industry. The department is specifically authorized to use third-party professional consultants as necessary to properly discharge its responsibilities under this article and to also allocate resources from the Continuing Care Provider Fee Fund as necessary to retain within the department the level of expertise required by the program. (f) During the four-year trial program, the five-hundred-thousand-dollar ($500,000) ceiling on the projected annual balance for the Continuing Care Provider Fee Fund specified in Section 1778 shall be increased to seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000). 1792.13. Review and Assessment of the Actuarial Study Requirement. (a) During the four-year trial period, the department shall continually assess the effectiveness of using actuarial studies to analyze the long-term financial position of the providers in California. (b) On January 1, 2003, the department shall form a nine-member panel after consultation with the prominent residents' associations, the prominent providers' associations, and the Continuing Care Advisory Committee. The department shall appoint to the panel three resident representatives, three provider representatives, and three representatives of the department. The panel shall determine the value of the actuarial study requirement in terms of all of the following: (1) Its effectiveness as a method for assessing a provider's long-term solvency. (2) Its usefulness to the department in the discharge of its statutory oversight responsibilities regarding providers' financial soundness. (3) Its usefulness to providers as a management tool. (4) Its effectiveness as a method for disclosing financial information regarding 72   providers to residents and potential residents of continuing care retirement communities. (c) The expenses incurred by the panel's members shall be charged to the Continuing Care Provider Fee Fund in the same manner and to the same extent as the expenses incurred by the members of the Continuing Care Advisory Committee are charged to the Continuing Care Provider Fee Fund under this chapter. (d) The panel shall issue a report to the department before February 13, 2004. The report shall include the panel's findings and any statutory changes it proposes to implement its findings. The report shall specifically address whether the actuarial study requirement should continue as law, and if so, it shall also reexamine how best to classify providers for purposes of the actuarial study requirement and recommend the appropriate interval between the actuarial studies required for each type of provider. If the panel advises against continuing the actuarial study requirement, the panel: (1) May recommend an alternative process, or ratify existing processes for evaluating and reporting a provider's long-term solvency. (2) Shall reexamine the adequacy of the reserve requirements stated in Article 6 (commencing with Section 1789) and make any recommendations it deems appropriate. (3) Shall reexamine the disclosure obligations of providers in regard to their long-term solvency and make any recommendations it deems appropriate. (e) The department shall submit recommendations to the Legislature as necessary to implement the recommendations of the panel through the enactment of legislation that would be effective on or before January 1, 2005. 1792.14. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this article, ""actuarial study"" means an analysis that addresses the current actuarial financial condition of a provider that is performed by an actuary in accordance with accepted actuarial principles and the standards of practice adopted by the Actuarial Standards Board. An actuarial study shall include all of the following: (1) An actuarial report. (2) A statement of actuarial opinion. (3) An actuarial balance sheet. (4) A cohort pricing analysis. (5) A cash-flow projection. (6) A description of the actuarial methodology, formulae, and assumptions. (b) ""Actuary"" means a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries who is qualified to sign a statement of actuarial opinion. 1792.15. Actuarial Study Requirements for Applicants. (a) An actuarial study, prepared or reviewed by an actuary, shall be submitted to the department by every applicant proposing a new continuing care retirement community except those applicants that, as of January 1, 2001, have fully satisfied the requirements of Section 1780 for issuance of a permit to accept deposits related to the proposed ~~ Italics indicate corrections 73   project. The actuarial study shall demonstrate that the proposed continuing care retirement community's financial position is in satisfactory actuarial balance and shall include all of the following: (1) An actuarial balance sheet that demonstrates that, for a hypothetical cohort of new residents at the proposed continuing care retirement community, the sum of the entrance fees to be paid at occupancy plus the actuarial present value at occupancy of those residents' periodic fees equals the actuarial present value at occupancy of the costs of performing all obligations to those residents under their continuing care contracts, plus appropriate provision for surplus. (2) Supporting detailed documentation for the actuarial balance sheet, including all of the following: (A) A projection of future population flows, for the first 20 years, using appropriate mortality, morbidity, withdrawal, and other demographic assumptions. (B) A projection of future health care needs and corresponding costs by level of care, for the first 20 years, using appropriate inflation factors, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal, and other demographic assumptions. (C) A description of the actuarial data, assumptions, and methods used to create the projections in the actuarial report. (3) A pricing analysis that demonstrates that, for a typical cohort of replacement residents at the continuing care retirement community, the sum of the entrance fees to be paid at occupancy plus the actuarial present value at occupancy of periodic fees paid by the residents equals the actuarial present value at occupancy of the costs of performing all obligations to the residents under their continuing care contracts, with appropriate provision for surplus. (4) Cash-flow statements that project positive cash balances for a 20-year period. (5) The opinion of the actuary that the data and assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate, the methods employed are consistent with sound actuarial principles and practices, and provision has been made for all actuarial liabilities and related statement items. 1792.16. Actuarial Review Required. (a) Each provider shall submit an actuarial study to the department during the years specified in Section 1792.18. (b) All actuarial studies shall be prepared or reviewed by an actuary and shall include all of the following: (1) An actuarial balance sheet that demonstrates whether the resources available for current residents, including the actuarial present value of periodic fees to be paid by the residents, is greater than or equal to the actuarial present value of the costs of performing all remaining obligations to those residents under their continuing care contracts, with appropriate provision for surplus. (2) Supporting detailed documentation for the actuarial balance sheet, including all of the following: 74   (A) A projection of future population flows, for the next 20 years, using appropriate mortality, morbidity, withdrawal, and other demographic assumptions. (B) A projection of future health care needs and corresponding costs, for the next 20 years, using appropriate inflation factors, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal, and other demographic assumptions. (C) A description of the actuarial data, assumptions, and methods used to create the projections in the actuarial study. (3) A pricing analysis that demonstrates whether, for a typical cohort of replacement residents at the continuing care retirement community, the sum of the entrance fees to be paid at occupancy plus the actuarial present value at occupancy of periodic fees paid by the residents equals the actuarial present value at occupancy of the costs of performing all remaining obligations to the residents under their continuing care contracts, with appropriate provision for surplus. (4) Cash-flow statements that project cash balances with respect to current and future residents for a period of at least 20 years. (5) The opinion of the actuary that the data and assumptions used are appropriate, the methods employed are consistent with sound actuarial principles and practices, and whether provision has been made for all actuarial liabilities and related statement items. 1792.17. Provider Classification. (a) For purposes of this section, the term ""health care guarantee"" means the degree to which the fees charged by a provider in a continuing care contract for health care, including assisted living services and skilled nursing care, are less than the fees charged by the provider on a per diem basis to noncontinuing care contract residents. The three types of health care guarantees are extensive, limited, and nominal and are described as follows: (1) An extensive health care guarantee exists in all life care contracts and prepaid contracts as well as all other continuing care contracts where a resident either: (A) Pays the same or nearly the same monthly fee for health care, including temporary or permanent assisted living services or skilled nursing care, as the resident was charged while residing in an residential living unit. (B) Pays a rate for health care, including temporary or permanent assisted living or skilled nursing care, that, regardless of the duration of his or her health care needs, is 80 percent or less of the per diem rate charged to noncontinuing care contract residents. (2) A limited health care guarantee exists in all continuing care contracts where the health care guarantee is not extensive or nominal. (3) A nominal health care guarantee exists in all continuing care contracts where the resident is charged less than the per diem rate charged to noncontinuing care contract residents for health care for five or fewer days in any 12-month period and otherwise pays on a per diem basis for all levels of health care. (b) The department shall classify each provider as a Type I Provider, a Type II ~~ Italics indicate corrections 75   Provider, or a Type III Provider based on the following: (1) A Type I Provider is a provider that has entered into a continuing care contract that includes an extensive health care guarantee. (2) A Type II Provider is a provider to which both of the following apply: (A) Has entered into a continuing care contract that includes a limited health care guarantee. (B) Has not entered into any continuing care contract that includes an extensive health care guarantee. (3) A Type III Provider is a provider that satisfies either of the following: (A) It has only entered into continuing care contracts that include nominal health care guarantees. (B) It does not charge entrance fees or monthly service fees, such as those providers who accept an assignment of assets and fund the costs of providing care with charitable contributions. 1792.18. Filing Periods. (a) A provider shall file its actuarial study within 45 days after the due date for its annual report. Each provider that operates more than one continuing care retirement community shall prepare one actuarial study encompassing all its communities and shall be assigned a single date for filing its actuarial study. All providers shall file actuarial studies with the department during the years specified as follows: (1) Each provider classified as a Type I Provider shall file an initial actuarial study following its annual report filed during the 2001 calendar year. A Type I Provider that has completed an actuarial study satisfying the requirements of this article during the 2000 calendar year may file that actuarial study with the department in order to satisfy the provider's obligation under this section. (2) Each provider classified as a Type II Provider shall file an initial actuarial study according to the following schedule: (A) Six of the providers holding certificates of authority on January 1, 2001, or a lesser number, at the department's discretion, shall file their actuarial studies following their annual report filed during the 2001 calendar year. (B) One-half of the remaining number of providers holding certificates of authority on January 1, 2001, shall file their actuarial studies following their annual reports filed during the 2002 calendar year. (C) The remaining providers holding certificates of authority on January 1, 2001, shall file their actuarial studies following their annual reports filed during the 2003 calendar year. (3) A provider classified as a Type III Provider shall not be obligated by this article to file an actuarial study. (b) As soon as practicable following January 1, 2001, the Continuing Care Advisory Committee shall select randomly those Type II Providers that will be required to file their actuarial studies following their annual reports filed during the 2001, 2002, and 2003 76   calendar years. A Type II Provider that has completed an actuarial study satisfying the requirements of this article during the 2000 calendar year may request that the department both designate the provider as one of the providers that is required to file an actuarial study in the 2001 calendar year and that the provider's 2000 calendar year actuarial study be accepted by the department in satisfaction of the provider's obligation to file an actuarial study in the 2001 calendar year. A provider shall submit to the department a copy of its 2000 calendar year actuarial study with its request. (c) Applicants that have applications pending as of January 1, 2001, shall file an actuarial study as follows: (1) Applicants that submitted an actuarial study with their application shall file their initial actuarial study as a provider during the year they file their first annual report after the earliest of the following occurs: (A) The new continuing care retirement community reaches 85 percent occupancy. (B) Thirty months following the issuance of a preliminary certificate of authority for the new continuing care retirement community. (2) All other applicants shall file their initial actuarial study during the year they file their first annual report. (d) A provider shall pay a one thousand dollar ($1,000) late fee if it fails to file its actuarial study on or before the date it is due. A provider shall pay an additional late fee of thirty-three dollars ($33) per day for each day after the first 30 days that the actuarial study is late. All late fees due shall accompany the actuarial study when it is filed or late fees shall continue to accrue until paid. The late fees described in this subdivision are separate from, and accrue independently of, any other late fees that may apply if a provider fails to file its annual report when due. The department may, at its discretion, waive this late fee upon a showing of good cause by the provider. 1792.19. Satisfactory Actuarial Balance Required. (a) Each actuarial study required of a provider by Section 1792.16 shall demonstrate that the provider's financial condition is in satisfactory actuarial balance, including an appropriate surplus, such that the provider has the financial resources to meet all its actuarial liabilities. A provider's financial condition is in satisfactory actuarial balance if its actuarial study includes all of the following: (1) An actuarial balance sheet that demonstrates the resources available for current residents at the continuing care retirement community, including the actuarial present value of periodic fees to be paid by the residents, at least equals the actuarial present value of the costs of performing all remaining obligations to those residents under their continuing care contracts, with appropriate provision for surplus. (2) A pricing analysis that demonstrates, for a typical cohort of replacement residents at the continuing care retirement community, the sum of the entrance fees to be paid at occupancy plus the actuarial present value at occupancy of periodic fees paid by the residents equals the actuarial present value at occupancy of the costs of performing all 77   remaining obligations to the residents under their continuing care contracts, with appropriate provision for surplus. (3) Cash-flow statements that project positive cash balances with respect to current and future residents for a period of at least 20 years. (4) The opinion of the actuary that provision has been made for all actuarial liabilities and related statement items. (b) In the event that an actuarial study shows insufficient financial resources to meet all its actuarial liabilities or an actuarial balance sheet deficit, the actuarial report shall clearly state the implications of the provider's financial condition. The report shall specifically describe management's plans for improving its financial position to achieve an actuarial balance including an appropriate surplus. In addition, the provider shall submit with its actuarial study a detailed narrative addressing its actuarial deficiency and describing its plan to achieve actuarial balance. 1792.20. Review of Actuarial Assumptions; Comparison with Actuarial Experience. (a) Each provider that has submitted an actuarial study to the department shall, after the close of each fiscal year, review and compare its actual results from operations during the closed year to the assumptions made in its actuarial study for that year in a form prescribed by the department. (b) Providers are not required to file the statement described in subdivision (a) in any year that they file an actuarial report. 1792.21. Unpaid Fines. Any unpaid fines accruing or assessed under the provisions of this article as of January 1, 2005, when this article is repealed pursuant to Section 1792.22 shall remain payable and continue to accrue in the same manner as provided in this article. 1792.22. Effective Term. This article shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2005, and as of that date is repealed. CAUTION: SECTION 1793 IS SUPERSEDED BY SECTION 1792.6 (SB 2077, CHAPTER 820, STATUTES OF 2000)  1793. Reserves for Refundable Contracts. (a) Any provider offering a refundable contract, or other entity assuming responsibility for refundable contracts, shall maintain a refund reserve fund in trust for the residents. This trust fund shall remain intact to accumulate interest earnings resulting from investments of liquid reserves in accordance with paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) and subparagraphs (A) through (E), inclusive, of paragraph (3) of subdivision (e) of Section 1792.2. The amount of the refund reserve shall be revised annually by the 78   CAUTION: SECTION 1793 IS SUPERSEDED BY SECTION 1792.6 (SB 2077, CHAPTER 820, STATUTES OF 2000)  provider and submitted to the department in conjunction with the annual report required by Section 1790. (b) Any providers or other entity assuming responsibility for refundable contracts, which has not executed refundable contracts in a continuing care retirement community prior to January 1, 1996, and proposes to execute these contracts in that continuing care retirement community after that date, shall maintain a refund reserve fund in trust for the residents holding such contracts. (1) Except as noted in paragraph (2), this trust fund shall remain intact as specified in subdivision (a). (2) To the extent approved by the department, the trust account may invest up to 70 percent of the refund reserves in real estate that is used to provide care and housing for the holders of the refundable continuing care contracts and is located on the same campus where these continuing care contract holders reside. These investments in real estate shall be limited to 50 percent of the providers' net equity in the real estate. The net equity shall be the book value, assessed value, or current appraised value within 12 months prior to the end of the fiscal year, less any depreciation, encumbrances, and the amount required for statutory reserves under Section 1792.2, all according to audited financial statements acceptable to the department. This paragraph shall apply to applications, and for those phases of the project that were identified as part of applications, submitted after May 31, 1995. (3) Any provider who submitted an application on or before May 31, 1995, may provide for the refund obligation of this section with a trust account that invests up to 85 percent of the refund reserves in the continuing care retirement community's real estate and the remaining 15 percent in the form of either cash or an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit to be phased in over a two-year period beginning with initial occupancy in the facility. (4) Each refund reserve trust fund shall be established at an institution qualified to be an escrow agent pursuant to an agreement between the provider and the institution based on this section and approved in advance by the department. (5) The amount to be held in the reserve fund shall be the total of the amounts calculated with respect to each individual resident as follows: (A) Determine the age in years and the portion of the entry fee for the resident refundable for the seventh year of residency and thereafter. (B) Determine life expectancy of that individual from the life expectancy table in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 1792.2. If there is a couple, use the life expectancy for the individual with the longer life expectancy. (C) For that resident, use an interest rate of 6 percent or lower to determine from compound interest tables the factor which represents the amount required today to grow at compound interest to one dollar ($1) at the end of the period of the life expectancy of the resident. 79   CAUTION: SECTION 1793 IS SUPERSEDED BY SECTION 1792.6 (SB 2077, CHAPTER 820, STATUTES OF 2000)  (D) Multiply the refundable portion of the resident's entry fee amount by the factor obtained in subparagraph (c) to determine the amount of reserve required to be maintained. (E) The sum of these amounts with respect to each resident shall constitute the reserve for refundable contracts. (F) The reserve for refundable contracts will be revised annually as provided for in subdivision (a), using the interest rate, refund obligation amount, and individual life expectancies current at that time. (6) Withdrawals may be made from the trust fund to pay refunds when due under the terms of the refundable entry fee contracts and when the balance in the trust fund exceeds the required refund reserve amount determined in accordance with paragraph (5) of subdivision (b). (7) Deposits shall be made to the trust fund with respect to new residents when the entry fee is received and in the amount determined with respect to that resident in accordance with paragraph (5) of subdivision (b). (8) Additional deposits shall be made to the trust fund within 30 days of any annual reporting date on which the trust fund balance falls below the required reserve in accordance with paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) and such deposits shall be in an amount sufficient to bring the trust fund balance into compliance with this section. (c) Any provider which has executed refundable contracts in a continuing care retirement community prior to January 1, 1996, and which has not executed refundable contracts in a continuing care retirement community prior to January 1, 1991, shall submit, for the department's approval, a method of determining a refund reserve to be held in trust for the residents. Approved methods include any of the following: (1) The establishment, at the time continuing care contracts are signed, of a reserve fund in trust for the full amount of the refunds promised. (2) The purchase from an insurance company, authorized to do business in the State of California, of fully paid life insurance policies for the full amount of the refunds promised. (3) A method approved by the American Academy of Actuaries in their Actuarial Standards of Practice Relating to Continuing Care Retirement Communities, which method provides for fully funding the refund obligations in a separate trust fund as provided in subdivision (b). (d) Any provider offering a refundable contract, or other entity assuming responsibility for refundable contracts prior to January 1, 1991, shall maintain a refund reserve bank account in trust for the residents as described in subdivision (b) except that the amount of refund reserves shall be calculated based on the following assumptions and methods of calculation: 80   CAUTION: SECTION 1793 IS SUPERSEDED BY SECTION 1792.6 (SB 2077, CHAPTER 820, STATUTES OF 2000)  (1) The continuing care retirement community will no longer receive entry fee income after a period of 40 years following the commencement of operation. (2) Approved long-term investments, such as treasury notes, will earn 3 percent more than the rate of inflation. (3) Entrance fees will increase at the rate of inflation. (4) Land values will increase at the rate of inflation. (5) Investments in the refund reserve trust will increase at the rate for approved long-term investments. (6) Calculate the number of units to be resold each year at the approved rate of turnover. (7) Determine the mean entrance fee, as of the current date. (8) Determine the factor for inflating the mean entrance fee at the rate of 3 percent below the interest rate on new 30-year treasury bonds, for each year from the current date to the 40th year of operation, or until all units have been turned over. (9) Calculate the inflated mean entrance fees for the 40th year and for each preceding year, until all units have been turned over. (10) Multiply the inflated mean entrance fee for the 40th year, and each preceding year, as specified in paragraph (9), by the annual turnover, as specified in paragraph (6), until the total of the annual turnovers used in the calculations equals the total number of units in the continuing care retirement community. (11) The projected refund liability shall be the sum of the products obtained pursuant to paragraph (10), multiplied by the rate of refund for the seventh year of residency, specified by current continuing care contracts, multiplied by the percentage of current continuing care contracts which specify this rate of refund. The projected refund liability amount shall be calculated for each rate, if existing continuing care contracts specify several rates. (12) The projected refund liability, or the aggregate of these liabilities, if several rates are obtained pursuant to paragraph (11), may be reduced by the value of the land used for the continuing care retirement community, inflated to the 40th year of operation, as determined pursuant to paragraph (9), if the provider agrees to a lien pursuant to Section 1793.15 to secure this commitment. (13) Calculate the present value of the projected refund liability at the current rate of interest for new 30-year treasury bonds. The result is the required refund reserve. (e) Any entity which holds a certificate of authority, provisional certificate of authority, or permit to sell deposit subscriptions on or before September 23, 1986, shall be exempted from the refund reserve requirement established by this section, if the entity has an equity balance of five times the amount of the refund reserves calculated pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) through (13). (1) The equity balance shall be verified by one or more of the following means: 81   CAUTION: SECTION 1793 IS SUPERSEDED BY SECTION 1792.6 (SB 2077, CHAPTER 820, STATUTES OF 2000)  (A) The ""stockholders' equity,"" or equivalent amount, as reflected on the most recent Form 10K (which may be on a consolidated basis or on a consolidated and combined basis) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (B) The ""total fund balance of net worth,"" or equivalent amount, as reflected on Form 990 or Form 990-PF filed with the Internal Revenue Service. (C) The ""total net worth,"" or equivalent amount, as reflected on the most recent Form 109 filed with the Franchise Tax Board. (2) The amount of the requirement for the equity balance shall be revised annually pursuant to this section. (3) Compliance shall be based on review, by the department, of financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, accompanied by an unqualified opinion by a certified public accountant. (4) If the equity balance is determined by the department to be less than the required amount, the provider or other entity assuming responsibility shall deposit, in a form satisfactory to the department, an amount equal to the refund reserve required within 60 days. (f) All continuing care retirement communities offering refundable entrance fees that are not secured by cash reserves, except those facilities that were issued a certificate of authority prior to May 31, 1995, shall clearly disclose this fact in all marketing materials and continuing care contracts.  82   Article 7.

The facts are as follows: The Ventura County Assessor has for many years levied a possessory interest assessment against the Civil Air Patrol.for an aircraft "" tie down,"" This year the Civil Air Patrol has protested the assessment on the ground that it is an instrumentality of the United States pursuant to 10 U.S.C. section 9441(c) and that its property is therefore immune from taxation. As you know, property owned by federal instrumentalities is immune from taxation by the states unless Congress has consented to taxation (Ehrman and Flavin.

The foregoing statutory provision as amended in 1980 makes it clear that the Civil Air Patrol is a federal instrumentality for purposes of tort liability but it does not answer the question of b;hethrr the Civil Air Patrol is a federal instrumentality for purposes of immunity from local taxation. The Civil Air Patrol was created by an Act of Congress July 1, 1946 and declared to be a body corporate, with perpetuai and various powers including the power to sue and be succession to acquire and hold property: to accept gifts, legacies sued; to establish and maintain offices for the conduct and devises: of the affairs of the corporation in the District of Columbia and in the several States and Territories of the United States; and to do all acts and things necessary and proper to carry into effect the objects and purposes of the corporation (36 U.S.C.A.  201, 205). The objects and purposes of the corporation are to provide an organization to encourage and aid American citizens in the contribution of their efforts, services and resources in the development of aviation and in the maintenance of air to encourage and develop by example the voluntary supremacy; contribution of private citizens to the public welfare; to provide aviation education and training; to encourage and foster civil aviation in local communities and to provide an organization of private citizens with adequate facilities to assist in meeting local and national emergencies (36 U.S.C.A.  no power to issue capital The Civil Air Patrol has "" 202 1. stock or engage in business for pecuniary profit or gain, its objects and purposes being solely of a benevolent character 2nd (36 not for the pecuniary profit or gain of its members.""

GX271-54-4375806	"CONDENSED ANALYSES OF PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS September 13, 2003, Election  Prepared by the Staff of the Texas Legislative Council Austin, Texas  Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, Chairman Speaker Tom Craddick, Vice Chairman Steven R. Collins, Chief Legislative Counsel and Executive Director July 2003   AMENDMENT NO. 1 The constitutional amendment authorizing the Veterans' Land Board to use assets in certain veterans' land and veterans' housing assistance funds to provide veterans homes for the aged or infirm and to make principal, interest, and bond enhancement payments on revenue bonds.  SUMMARY: The proposed amendment would allow the Veterans' Land Board to use excess receipts in the veterans' land fund, the veterans' housing assistance fund, and the veterans' housing assistance fund II to pay the debt service on any revenue bonds issued by t he bo ard. Sp ecifically, the board could use those receipts to pay principal and interest and make bond enhancement payments with respect to revenue bonds issued under a veterans homes program or other veterans progr ams administered by the board, and not solely in connection with its land and housing assistance programs for veterans. The amendment would also allow the Veterans' Land Board to use excess assets in the three funds to plan and design, operate, maintain, enlarge, or improve veterans homes . This new la nguage would supplement the effect of an earlier constitutional amendment that granted the board similar authority with respect to veterans cemeteries. ARGUMENTS FOR: Security for revenue bonds issued by the Veterans' Land Board would increase because the debt service on those bonds could be paid with money produced from multiple board programs. Less overall risk associated with the revenue bonds means that the board could obtain a more favorable credit rating and pay interest at a lower rate on the bonds, saving money for the state. The use of excess assets from certain Veterans' Land Board funds would preclude the necessity of issuing more revenue bonds for veterans homes, thus saving money for the state by reducing transaction costs associated with funding the construction of veterans homes. The excess money in the veterans' land and housing assistance programs was primarily paid for by veterans and should be available to assist all veterans programs administered by the Veterans' Land Board. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: At least some of the money that was formerly earmarked for veterans' land and ho usin g assis tance p rograms may go to entirely different programs administered by the Veterans' Land Board; the board has complete discretion to determine how much money to retain within the land and housing assistance programs. Adoption of the amendment would lead to dilution of money currently reserved for two veterans programs, the land and housing assistance programs, so that it would be spread out over twice as many programs.  1   AMENDMENT NO. 2 The constitutional amendment to establish a two-year period for the redemption of a mineral interest sold for unpaid ad valorem taxes at a tax sale. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment to Section 13(c), Article VIII, of the Texas Constitution increases the period in which the former owner of a mineral interest that is sold at a tax sale for unpaid ad valorem taxes may redeem the property from the person who purchased it. The redemption period is increased from six months after the date the purchaser's deed is filed for record to two years after that date. To redeem th e property, the former owner must pay to the person who purchased the property the amount the purchaser at the tax sale paid for the property, including the tax deed recording fee and all taxes, penalties, interest, and costs paid, plus an amount not exceeding 25 percent of the aggregate total in the first year of the redemption period or 50 percent of the aggregate total in the second year. The pro pos ed a men dment to Sec tion 1 3(d ), A rti cle VIII, of the Texas Constitution makes a conforming change. The amendment takes effect January 1, 2004, and applies only to the redemption of a mineral interest sold at a tax sale for which the purchaser's deed is filed for record on or after January 1, 2004. ARGUMENTS FOR: Since 1876, the Texas Constitution provided for a two-year redemption period for property sold at a tax sale. Only recently was the constitution amended to limit the redemption period for most property, including a mineral interest, to six months. Unlike information for other real property, the information used to identify and list mineral interests on the tax rolls is often derived from private industry, so it may be outdated or inaccurate. In addition, due to the usual business practices associated with developing a mineral interest, there are frequently numerous fractional owners who depend on the owner of the working interest to pay the taxes on the prop erty. For these reasons, the owner of a mineral interest may not receive timely notice that taxes on the property are delinquent or that the property has been ordered to be sold. Increasing the redemption period from six months to two years, as it was previously, would reduce the chance that the redemption period would expire before the owner of a mineral interest learned that the property had been sold. Current law unfairly distinguishes between residence homesteads and agricultural land on one hand and mineral interests on the other hand for purposes of the right of redemption. There is no principled basis for such a distinction. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: The amendment would discourage investors from purchasing mineral interests at tax sales and make it more difficult for taxing units to dispose of property at a tax sale. Under current law, a purchaser of a mineral interest at a tax sale is required to wait only six months before obtaining clear title. If the purchaser incurs expenses in developing the minerals and the former owner exercises the right of redemption, the former owner may profit unfairly from the expenses incurred by the purchaser. A prospective purchaser may be reluctant to purchase a mineral interest and wait two years before developing the property, and taxing units would experience costly delays in getting mineral interests back onto their tax rolls. The amendment would not resolve the inequity in current law of having different redemption periods apply to different types of real property. Commercial property would continue to be subject to a shorter redemption period than 2   residence homesteads, agricultural land, and mineral interests.  3   AMENDMENT NO. 3 The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation property owned by a religious organization that is leased for use as a school or th at is owned wit h t he in tent of ex pand in g or con st ructin g a reli giou s facil it y. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Section 2(a), Article VIII, Texas Constitution, to authorize the legislature by general law to exempt from ad valorem taxation the property owned by a religious organization that also owns a place of religious worship, such as a church or temple, if the property is owned for the purpose of expanding the place of religious worship or constructing a new place of religious worship and if the property does not produce any revenue for the religious organization. The amendment also authorizes the legislature by general law to provide eligibility limitations for the exemption and to impose sanctions related to the exemption. In addition, the amendment authorizes the legislature by general law to exempt from ad valorem taxation any property owned by a religious organization that is leased to a person for use as a school that meets the statutory definition for a school that is exempt from taxation. ARGUMENTS FOR: The proposed amendment permits a religious organization to plan for the growth of its congregation by acquiring property for expansion without incurring ad valorem taxes on the property pending the beginning of construction. The legislature has the authority to impose eligibility limi tati ons fo r the ex empti on, i nclud ing a time limit, and to require the payment of back taxes if the property is not ultimately used for a place of worship. The amendment would allow a religious organization that leases its property for use as a nonprofit school to enjoy the same exemption from taxation as a person who owns property that the person uses as a school. The amendment eliminates an unjustified distinction between property owners who operate schools on their property and prop erty owners who lease their property to others to operate schools and encourages religious organizations to use their property for educational purposes. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: The Texas Constitution and the Tax Code already allow a religious organization to receive an ad valorem tax exemption for the organization's place of worship, including an exemption for not more than three years while the place is under construction. The amend ment's broadening of the exemption to include future expansion or construction of a new place of worship will take property off the tax rolls even though it may not actually be used for religious purposes for years. The Texas Constitution and the Tax Code already provide for an exemption from ad valorem taxation for property a person owns and us es as a s chool . All owing a religious organization to receive a tax exemption for property that is leased to another person to be used as a school will encourage religious organizations to use property for nonreligious purposes and discriminate between religious organizations and other property owners who lease property for that purpose. The exemption would also deprive school districts and other local governments of tax revenue and put an unfair burden on other property owners who may be required to pay higher taxes to offset the lost tax revenue.  4   AMENDMENT NO. 4 The constitutional amendment relating to the provision of parks and recreational facilities by certain conservation and reclamation districts. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Section 59, Article XVI, Texas Constitution, to provide that conservation and reclamation districts have the specific right and duty to develop parks and recreational facilities. The amendment requires the legislature to pass laws concer ning t he development of parks and recreational facilities by districts. The amendment, without limiting the power to finance parks and recreational facilities that currently exists, provides for the issuance of bonds financed by taxes in districts located completely or partially in a limited number of areas. ARGUMENTS FOR: The proposed amendment clarifies an area of the law that has been at issue by stating clearly that conservation and reclamation districts may create parks and recreational facilities. The amendment would empower the voters in certain areas to choose to finance area parks and recreational facilities with tax dollars if they feel the need exists. It is proper to place this decision with the affected voters, and restricting this power to certain areas limits it to localities where the greatest need exists. The amendment would allow conservation and reclamation districts to meet the recreational needs of communities whose needs are not being met by the city, town, or county in which they are located. Many citizens live in unincorporated areas not adequately serviced, and authorizing conservation and reclamation districts to improve the civic spaces of a community will improve the quality of life for area residents. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: There is no reason to allow only districts in the listed areas to use tax dollars to finance parks and recreational facilities while districts elsewhere may not use tax dollars for that purpose. Conservation and reclamation districts should focus on water and conservation issues. Other political subdivisions, such as municipalities and counties, currently have the ability to address parks and recreational needs and are more appropriate entities to satisfy those needs. The creation of some conservation and reclamation districts is initiated by and significantly benefits private developers. Allowing districts to provide parks and recreational facilities and to finance them with tax money creates too much of a risk that the facilities would be provided at public expense to create an amenity that a private developer can use to promote a land development.  5   AMENDMENT NO. 5  The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation travel trailers not held or used for the production of income. SUMMARY: Section 1(d), Article VIII, Texas Constitution, currently authorizes the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxes certain tangible personal property but excludes the legislature from exempting tangible personal property structures used or occupied as residential dwellings. The proposed amendment amends Subsection (d) to exclude from be ing exempt only those structures used or occupied as residential dwellings that are substantially affixed to real estate. The amendment repeals Section 1(j), Article VIII, Texas Constitution, which authorizes the legislature to allow a taxing unit, other than a school district, to exempt travel trailers from ad valorem taxes. ARGUMENTS FOR: Approval of the proposed amendment will eliminate the mandatory school taxes on travel trailers and provide travel trailers with the same tax treatment as other noncommercial personal property, such as motor vehicles. The exemption will eliminate the current disincentive for consumers in Texas to purchase travel trailers that will not be attached to real property and will also promote tourism and economic development. Imposition of the ad valorem tax on travel trailers by those school districts and other taxing units that elect to tax travel trailers amounts to ""double taxation"" because the purchaser of a travel trailer is also required to pay sales and use taxes and annual vehicle registration fees on the trailer. In 2001, the legislature and the voters intended to authorize the elimination of ad valorem taxes on travel trailers. Approval of the amendment will authorize the legislature to rectify the unintended effect of the 2001 amendment and end the double tax on travel trailers. Ad valorem taxation of travel trailers is very inefficient, due to the costs of identifying and appraising them and of billing for and collecting the relatively small amount of taxes imposed on each of them. Approval of the amendment will require a school district or other taxing unit that elects to tax travel trailers to bear the full costs of taxation, which are currently borne in large part by the appraisal district. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: If the proposed amendment is adopted, those school districts and other taxing units that do tax travel trailers will lose the property tax revenue they currently receive from the taxation of travel trailers unless their governing bodies act affirmatively to impose an ad valorem tax on those trailers. To make up any shortfall, those school districts and taxing units may have to impose higher property taxes on other property owners, including persons who own and reside in manufactured homes and other types of homes. A person who resides in a travel trailer, regardless of whether it is affixed to real property, should be required to pay property taxes on the trailer, just like other home owners, including those who reside in manufactured homes. The proposed exemption of travel trailers creates a property tax break for a small group of persons who will no longer pay their fair share of taxes. By requiring a school district or other taxing unit to take affirmative action to tax travel trailers, and imposing all the costs of appraising those travel trailers on a school district or other taxing unit choosing to tax them, the legislature is unfairly discouraging those school districts and other taxing units that have previously taxed travel trailers from continuing to tax them in order to maintain their current tax base.  6   AMENDMENT NO. 6 The constitutional amendment permitting refinancing of a home equity loan with a reverse mortgage. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Section 50(f), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, by providing that a home equity loan may be refinanced in a manner that converts the loan into a reverse mortgage. The same change proposed by this amendment is also being proposed, among other constitutional changes, by Proposition 16, which is being submitted to the voters at this election. ARGUMENT FOR: Reverse mortgages are a popular means for seniors to supplement their income by tapping the equity in their homes. Beginning in 1998, there were several years when home equity loans were available but reverse mortgages were not offered. During this period many persons who would have preferred reverse mortgages obtained home equity loans instead. The proposed amendment would allow those borrowers to convert their existing home equity loans into reverse mortgages. ARGUMENT AGAINST: Reverse mortgages are not subject to all the extensive safeguards that apply to home equity loans. Elderly persons, who may be more susceptible to unscrupulous or uncaring lending practices, may be victimized by lenders who would convince elderly borrowers under home equity loans to convert those loans to reverse mortgages under terms unfairly favorable to the lender.  7   AMENDMENT NO. 7 The constitutional amendment to permit a six-person jury in a district court misdemeanor trial. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment specifies that a district court petit jury hearing a criminal misdemeanor case must consist of six persons. In a conforming change, the amendment also strikes a provision allowing nine members of a district court 12-member jury to render a verdict in a criminal misdemeanor case. ARGUMENTS FOR: Six-member county court juries are authorized by Article 33.01, Code of Criminal Procedure, to hear criminal misdemeanor cases, and a majority of misdemeanor cases are tried before those six-member juries. However, in some small or rural counties, 12-member district court juries hear criminal misdemeanor cases. Allowing six-member juries in district court criminal misdemeanor trials would bring uniformity to the law. Reducing the number of jurors in criminal misdemeanor cases would save counties time an d m on ey w ithout sacrificing the merits of a jury trial. ARGUMENT AGAINST: Allowing six-member district court jury trials in criminal misdemeanor cases would reduce the procedural protection of a 12-member jury in misdemeanor official misconduct cases. The legislature intended a 12-member jury trial in those cases involving a public official accused of a crime that might lead to the official's removal from office.  8   AMENDMENT NO. 8 The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to permit a person to take office without an election if the person is the only candidate to qualify in an election for that office. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment adds Section 13, Article XVI, Texas Constitution, to authorize the legislature to provide by general law that a person may take office without an election if that person is the only candidate to qualify in an election to be held for that office. ARGUMENTS FOR: By authorizing the legislature to allow an authority holding an election to avoid the expense of time and money to count votes for unopposed candidates, the proposed amendment promotes efficiency in election administration and would help reduce the cost of elections with out i nterf ering w ith an yone's right to vote. If a candidate is unopposed, and no other candidate, including a write-in candidate, is eligible for election to that office, the race is decided before the election occurs. The amendment would permit the legislature to give election officials greater flexibility in ballot preparation, and shorter, simpler ballots will allow the voter to focus on contested races, without having to sort through the unopposed candidates. Shorter ballots will also reduce voter confusion, especially during the implementation of new electronic voting systems. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Omitting a candidate from the ballot deprives voters of their right to vote for the candidate of their choice. Those who take the time to vote are exercising their right to endorse the candidates they wish to represent them and validate the candidates' election to public office. The right to vote for a candidate should exist whether or not there is a choice in candidates. The amendment would authorize the legislature to deprive candidates of the opportunity to gain visibility by campaigning and make it more difficult for the voters to know who their elected leaders are or what offices are being filled. The formality of an election is an important part of the demo cratic process t hat s ho ul d n ot be rend ered in to a mere techn icalit y.  9   AMENDMENT NO. 9 The constitutional amendment relating to the use of income and appreciation of the permanent school fund. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Section 5, Article VII, Texas Constitution, to allow the State Board of Education or the legislature to determine the amount distributed from the permanent school fund (PSF) to the available school fund (ASF) from a portion of the ""total return,"" including capital gains, on all investment assets of the PSF. The amendment places limits on the portion of total return that may be transferred to the ASF and provides for payment from the PSF of the expenses of managing permanent school fund assets. ARGUMENTS FOR: Texas voters in 1999 approved a total return policy for the permanent university fund, which supports various institutions in the University of Texas and the Texas A &M systems. Because much of the increase in value of a portfolio such as that held by the PSF comes as capital gains, the corpus of the PSF can be protected even if a portion of those gains is distributed to the ASF. Changing to a total return policy for the PSF is expected to yield significant additional net revenue for the benefit of public schools. The Legis lati ve Budge t Board estim ates t he chan ge would produce additional net revenue of over $230 million in fiscal year 2004, $247 million in fiscal year 2005, and somewhat less in fiscal year 2006 and beyond. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Because the PSF is a permanent endowment, a conservative investment strat egy would retain all capital gains as part of the PSF. The state should avoid any danger that the corpus of the PSF, on an inflation-adjusted, per-student basis, will decline. It is possible that a continued drop in stock prices would lead to lower distributions from the PSF to the ASF, not higher. Even if PSF distributions to the ASF increase, that does not mean most public schools will receive more money. In districts that receive state aid under the Foundation School Program, the increase in AS F payments is matched b y a decrease in foundation school fund payments. As ASF payments to wealthy school districts increase, so does the gap between the revenue available to school districts that rely on state aid and the revenue available to the wealthiest districts. This could potentially disturb the equity of the school finance system.  10   AMENDMENT NO. 10 The constitutional amendment authorizing municipalities to donate surplus fire-fighting equipment or supplies for the benefit of rural volunteer fire departments. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment adds Section 52i, Art icl e III, Texas Constitution, to create an additional exception to the general constitutional prohibition against a county, city, town, or other political subdivision of the state granting a thing of value to any individual, association, or corporation. ARGUMENTS FOR: Rural areas often do not have the financial resources to purchase necessary fire-fighting equipment or supplies. The proposed amendment creates a method by which municipal areas may ""recycle"" unused equipment or supplies for the benefit of rural communities in need. Surplus fire-fighting equipment or supplies normally will have little, if any, value, and the cost incurred in selling the property may exceed the revenue generated by the sale. A cost-effective way to dispose of the property is to donate it to rural volunteer fire departments that have a recognizable need. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: The amendment allows for the donated equipment or supplies to be distributed to rural volunteer fire departments ""based on need."" However, the amendment does not provide any criteria under which a finding of need can be made. The donating municipality may incur some costs in making the donation, and the amendment should have contained provisions to require the donating municipality to recover those costs.  11   AMENDMENT NO. 11 A constitutional amendment to allow the legislature to enact laws authorizing and governing the operation of wineries in this state. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment would amend Section 20, Art icl e XV I, Texas Constitution, to permit the legislature to authorize wineries to manufacture, sell, and dispense wine in any area of the state, even if the sale of wine in the area has not been authorized by a local option election. ARGUMENTS FOR: The proposed amendment would permit potentially large gro wth i n the s tate's agricultural base in a new area that could replace past agricultural practices that are no longer viable by expanding the areas in which wineries may operate to include dry areas. The legislation ensures that state agriculture would benefit from the sale of wine in dry areas by requiring that wine sold or dispensed by wineries in those areas be made primarily from fruit grown in this state. The amendment provides a very narrow exemption to the requirement that alcoholic beverage sales be authorized by a local option election, allowing dry areas to maintain local control of most alcoholic bevera ge sales and eliminating the need for the expense of holding an election to permit the sale of alcohol by a narrow class of permit holders. The amendment would bring greater uniformity to laws governing the operation of wineries in this state. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: The amendment would override the preference of many local communities to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within their boundaries. A community that wants to authorize only the sale of wine by a winery may already do so. Current law does not prohibit the expansion of the wine industry in areas in which the manufacture and sale of wine is already legal.  12   AMENDMENT NO. 12 The constitutional amendment concerning civil lawsuits against doctors and health care providers, and other actions, authorizing the legislature to determine limitations on non-economic damages. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment would add a new Section 66 to Article III, Texas Constitution, that authorizes the legislature by statute to determine the limit of liability for all damages and losses, however characterized, other than economic damages, in health care liability claims and other claims. The first part of new Section 66 to Article III, Texas Constitution, authorizes the legislature by statute to determine liability limits for a provider of medical or health care with respect to treatment, lack of treatment, or other claimed departure from an accepted standard of medical or health care or safety, however characterized, that is or is claimed to be a cause of, or that contributes or is claimed to contribute to, disease, injury, or death of a person. ""Economic damages"" are defined to mean compensatory damages for any pecuniary loss or damage. ""Economic damages"" do not include any loss or damage, however characterized, for past, present, and future physical pain and suffer ing, mental anguish and suffering, loss of con so rtiu m, lo ss of comp anio ns hi p and so ciety, disfigurement, or ph ysical impairment. The authority of the legislature by statute to determine liability limits applies without regard to whether the claim or cause of action arises under or is derived from common law, a statute, or other law, including any claim or cause of action based or sounding in tort, contract, or any other theory or any combination of theories of liability. The claim or cause of action includes a medical or health care liability claim as defined by the legislature. This first part authorizes the legislature to determine liability limits by a law enacted by the 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, and by all subsequent regular or special sessions of the legislature. The second part of new Section 66 to Article III, Texas Constitution, authorizes the legislature by statute to determine the limit of liability for all damages and losses, however characterized, other than economic damages, for claims or causes of action other than medical or health care liability claims. This authorization applies without regard to whether the claim or cause of action arises under or is derived from common law, a statute, or other law, including any claim or cause of action based or sounding in tort, contract, or any other theory or any combination of theories of liability. This second part authorizes the legislature by statute to determine liability limits for claims and causes of action that are not medical or health care liability claims only after January 1, 2005, and only by at least a three-fifths vote of all the members elected to each house. The statute adopted by the legislature must include language that cites new Section 66 as its auth orit y. Finall y, H.J.R. No. 3 provides that if the voters reject the proposed amendment, a court could not consider any aspect of the vote for any purpose, in any manner, or to any extent. ARGUMENTS FOR: In 2003, the legislature found a serious public problem in the availability and affordability of adequate medical professional liability insurance that created a medical malpractice 13   insurance crisis in Texas. It found that this crisis has had a material adverse effect on the delivery of medical and health care in Texas, including significant reductions of availability of medical and health care services to the people of Texas and a likelihood of further reductions. The proposed amendment is both balanced and limited in its manner of addressing the identified crisis. It does not authorize the legislature to limit the direct economic costs that may arise from a claim against a health care provider, nor does it authorize the legislature to limit in any way more indirect economic costs, such as lost wages. The amendment only authorizes the legislature to limit noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering, which is the element of a lawsuit that is the least predictable and the most subjective. Under the 2003 legislation, a claimant in a health care liability claim could recover as much as $750,000 for noneconomic damages, and the right of a person to obtain full redress for negligence that injures him or her is not unduly affected by allowing the legislature to impose such a limit. In 1977, the legislature enacted the initial liability limits on the recovery of noneconomic damages in health care liability claims, and it was not until 1988--eleven years later--that the Texas Supreme Court found those limits unconstitutional for common law causes of action. The long lag between enactment by the legislature of a limit on noneconomic damages and a definitive determination of constitutionality by the Texas Supreme Court is inherent in the judicial system and severely reduces both the effectiveness and predictability of any future liability limits enacted by the legislature. To promote predictability and stability in the civil justice system for doctors, health care providers, hospitals, and other health care institutions, it is necessary to give the legislature clear constitutional authority to enact limits on noneconomic damages. To effectively respond to future crises, the amendment authorizes the legislature to adopt, beginning January 1, 2005, limits on noneconomic damages for lawsuits other than health care liability claims. This authority will also allow the legislature to adopt liability limits that may avoid crises in those areas altogether. As a recognition of the seriousness of limits on noneconomic damages in lawsuits and as a further check and balance to legislative power, the amendment would provide that in suits other than health care liability claims, the legislature may only limit noneconomic damages by at least a three-fifths vote of all the members elected to each house, in st ead of a si mp le majo rity. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Section 13, Article I, Texas Constitution, known as the ""open courts provision"" provides that ""[a]ll courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him, in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law."" This is a fundamental right, contained i n the Bill of Rights in the Texas Constitution, and is properly protected by the courts. Even in the midst of a medical malpractice insurance crisis in Texas, it is the judiciary that is the proper forum to determine the extent to which a fundamental right may be reasonably restricted. The test established by the Texas Supreme Court in 1983 is reasonable, appropriate, and fully adequate: whether any limit on noneconomic damages adopted by the legislature is ""unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose and basis of the statute."" Under the 2003 legislation, a claimant in a health care liability claim could recover as much as $750,000 for noneconomic damages. That amount may be adequate and just for many cases, but it will not be adequate and just for all. 14   Alth ough a lengthy lag between enactment by the legislature of a limit on noneconomic damages and a defini ti ve determin atio n o f con st it utio nali ty b y th e Tex as Su preme Cou rt may be, to a certain extent, inherent in the judicial system, it need not take nearly as long as it has in the past. The Texas Constitution authorizes the legislature to provide for a direct appeal to the supreme court of the finding by a trial court that a statute is unconstitutional, and legislation enacted by the 78th Legislature provides for just such an accelerated appeal. Even if the medical malpractice insurance crisis in Texas justifies the legislature to enact limits on noneconomic damages in health care liability claims, no similar crisis has been identified by the legislature to justify it to enact limits on noneconomic damages for areas other than health care. Absent an identifiable and critical need, the courts are the appropriate guardian of the fundamental right that they be open to the people to fully redress wrongs. The requirement that, in suits other than health care liability claims, the legislature may only limit noneconomic damages by at least a three-fifths vote of all the members elected to each house, instead of a simple majority, is not a sufficient replacement for the tradit io nal p rotectio n o f thi s fun dament al right b y th e jud iciary.  15   AMENDMENT NO. 13 The constitutional amendment to permit counties, cities and towns, and junior colle ge districts to establish an ad valorem tax freeze on residence homesteads of the disabled and of the elderly and their spouses. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Section 1-b, Article VIII, Texas Constitution, by adding Subsection (h) to authorize the governing body of a county, a municipality, or a junior colle ge dist rict t o proh ibit increa ses in the am ount of cou nty, mun icipa l, or j unio r coll ege district ad valorem taxes that may be imposed on the residence homestead of a person who is disabled or who is 65 years of age or older. The proposed amendment would provide a means by which disabled and elderly persons can be provided the same beneficial tax treatment in connection with their county, municipal, or junior college district property taxes that elderly persons currently enjoy in connection with their public school district property taxes. ARGUMENTS FOR: Due to inflation, rising property values, or increases in tax rates, taxes imposed by counties, municipalities, and junior college districts have consistently increased over time. Tax increases are particularly hard on persons on fixed incomes, such as many elderly or disabled persons. The proposed amendment would allow local officials or voters to protect homeowners who are disabled or 65 years of age or older from increases in county, municipal, or junior college district property taxes, allowing those persons to remain in their homes. The amendment provi des a l ocal o ptio n meth od by whic h a cou nty, a mun icipa lity, or a juni or col lege district may limit tax increases on the residence homesteads of the disabled or elderly. The amendment does not require a county, municipality, or junior college district to establish a property tax freeze, nor does the amendment relieve disabled and elderly homeowners from all of the taxes they must pay to their county, municipality, or junior college district. The amount of tax revenue that will be lost in future years will be minimal and can be made up from other sources of revenue without significantly increasing the tax burdens of other taxpayers. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Limiting the amount of county, municipal, or junior college district taxes on the residence homesteads of the disabled or the elderly does not affect the total tax burden of the county, municipality, or junior college district but will only shift the tax burden among taxpayers. By limiting increases in the taxes owed by a disa bled o r elder ly person on th e perso n's home, the amendment unfairly shifts a portion of the tax burden to other homeowners and to owners of other types of property, primarily business property, who are not entitled to any limitation on such taxes. Regardless of the amount of tax revenue that will be lost if the amendment is adopted, the county, mu ni cipali ty, or junior college district will be forced to consider imposing higher taxes on other property owners to maintain the same level of services it currently provides. Because the amendment provides that a limitation on taxes that is adopted may not be rescinded or repealed, a county, municipality, or junior college district will be prevented from ever again asking its disabled or elderly residents to pay their fair share of the costs incurred in providing those services.  16   AMENDMENT NO. 14 The constitutional amendment providing for authorization of the issuing of notes or the borrowing of money on a short-term basis by a state transportation agency for transportation-related projects, and the issuance of bonds and other public securities secured by the state highway fund. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment would provide for the Texas Department of Transportation to issue notes or obtain loans with terms of t wo years or less t o carry out any of the d epartm ent's functions. The amendment would also provide for the Texas Transportation Commission to issue longer term bonds or other public securities to fund highway improvement projects. The bonds or other public securities would be payable from the money in the state highway fund. ARGUMENTS FOR: The state's population and the amount of traffic on state roads have grown enormo us ly, and new roads are needed. Allowing the state to borrow money for those purposes, rather than waiting for the money to accumulate, will allow those problems to be addressed earlier. The state already borrows money for many purposes, and the building of roads using short-term borrowing is an important tool to allow the state to more efficiently administer its function of providing for transportation. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Borrowing does not create new money for road construction, it only delays the time when payment is due. The state could actually increase the amount of road construction accomplished by finding additional sources of revenue for this purpose, such as increased vehicle registration fees or motor fuel taxes. By borrowing money the state will incur extra expenses, such as interest and the expenses related to issuing bonds or notes. These expenses may be paid from mo ney in th e state hi ghway fund , resul ti ng in less mo ney actu ally available to spend directly on transportation projects.  17   AMENDMENT NO. 15 The constitutional amendment providing that certain benefits under certain local public retirement systems may not be reduced or impaired. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Article XVI, Texas Constitution, by adding Section 66 to provide that any change made to certain benefits provided by certain retirement systems cannot reduce benefits that a person was entitled to receive before the date of the change. The amendment places the responsibility for ensuring that those benefits are not reduced on both the retirement system and the governmental entities that finance the system. The amendment applies to public retirement systems of political subdivisions, such as cities and counties, that provide benefits for their employees. Under the amendment, any reduction in the retirement or death benefits that the retirement systems provide cannot be applied retroactively to benefits that a person has accrued or is entitled to receive before the date the reduction takes effect. The application of the amendment is limited in several ways. It specifically exempts the retirement system that provides benefits for San Antonio firefighters and police officers, and it does not apply to any statewide retirement system. An opt-out provision is also included under which voters may choose to exempt a political subdivision from the application of the amendment at local elections to be held next year. The amendment applies only to service or disability retirement benefits and death benefits. Health and life insurance benefits are not within the scope of the amendment. Further, it does not apply to disability benefits that a person has previously received, but may no longer receive because the person no longer qualifies as disabled under the terms of the retirement system. ARGUMENTS FOR: In exchange for their years of work in public service, often at a lower salary than their counterparts in the private sector, local government employees should receive retirement benefits that are protected. This protection will enable these employees to better plan for retirement, knowing that the benefits they have earned are guaranteed. The proposed amendment would permit local public retirement systems to make changes in the provision of certain benefits as long as the changes apply prospectively. The amendment would also give those retirement systems the flexibility the systems need to adjust retirement benefits if necessary to respond to changing economic times, while still protecting the benefits that local government employees have earned. The amendment would give voters the flexibility to exempt a political subdivision from the application of the amendment at local elections to be held next year. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Providing a constitutional guarantee of certain benefit levels and placing the burden of that guarantee on both local public retirement systems and local government employers could force local governments to raise taxes, cut necessary services, or both, to maintain benefit levels. Although the amendment would protect the retirement benefits earned by employees of local governments, the amendment does not extend that protection to other public employees such as teachers and state employees. It is unfair to provide a constitutional protection of retirement benefits for some public employees but not for others. Although the amendment would give voters 18   the option of exempting a political subdivision from the application of the amendment, this opt-out provision is available to voters on only one date: a local election to be held in May 2004. In subsequent years, if a retirement system and a local government become unable to sustain retirement benefits at protected levels, voters would no longer be able to exempt their city or county from the amendment's application.  19   AMENDMENT NO. 16 The const itut ional amend ment a utho rizi ng a home equity line of credit, providing for administrative interpretation of home equity lending law, and otherwise relating to the making, refinancing, repayment, and enforcement of home equity loans. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Section 50, Article XVI, Texas Constitution, by providing that a home equity loan may be in the form of a line of credit, allowing a lender of a home equity loan who fails to comply with the lender's obligations under the loan to cure the failure and avoid forfeiting the principal of and interest on the loan, providing for interpretation by a state agency of the constitutional provisions relating to loans secured by a homestead, adding mortga ge brokers to the list of persons eligible to make home equity loans, allowing payments on a home equity loan to be more often than monthly, requiring lenders to provide to a borrower before closing of a home equity loan an itemized estimate of amounts that the borrower will be required to pay at the closing, and allowing a home equity loan to be refinanced by a reverse mortgage. This same change is also being proposed by Proposition 6, which is being submitted to the voters at this election. ARGUMENTS FOR: Home equity loans in the form of a line of credit are popular in other states, and borrowers in Texas also would like to have this flexible option. Allowing borrowers to access their homestead equity periodically in the amount needed rather than in a lump sum will save the borrowers the money that would otherwise be paid as interest on money borrowed before it is needed or on higher interest rate loans not secured by the homestead. Several years have passed since home equity loans were authorized in Texas, yet many lenders are still reluctant to offer the loans. This is because of the steep penalty for making an error in the loan process--loss of the entire principal of and interest on the loan--and because of the uncertainty of interpretation of some of the existing constitutional provisions. The proposed amendment would ease those fears by allowing the lenders to correct errors to bring the loans into compliance with the law, and by providing for administrative interpretations to give the meaning of the law more certainty. Reverse mortgages are a popular means for seniors to supplement their income by tapping the equity in their homes. Beginning in 1998, there were several years when home equity loans were available but reverse mortgages were no t b eing offered. During th is period many persons who would have preferred reverse mortga ges obtained home equity loans instead. The amendment would allow these borrowers to convert their existing home equity loans into reverse mortgages. ARGUMENTS AGAINST : Any loan secure d by a perso n's home has the risk that the person will lose the home if unable to make the payments. Lines of credit make it easier to borrow money throu gh loans secured by homes and consequently will cause more persons to lose their homes. The steep penalties for lenders who err exist because of the steep penalty for borrowers who err--loss of the borrower's home. The safeguards provided by the law are important to protect borrowers, and lenders should not be allowed to take them lightly, knowing that they can simply cure any problems if they are caught. Similarly, the constitutional provisions governing homestead mortgage lending have been submitted to and approved by the voters. An administrative agency should not be given the potential opportunity to void or alter what the voters have approved. Elderly persons, who may 20   be more susceptible to unscrupulous or uncaring lending practices, may be victimized by lenders who would convince elderly borrowers under home equity loans to convert those loans to reverse mortgages under terms unfairly favorable to the lender.  21   AMENDMENT NO. 17 The constitutional amendment to prohibit an increase in the total amount of school district ad valorem taxes that may be imposed on the residence homestead of a disabled person. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Subsection (d), Section 1-b, Article VIII, Texas Constitution, which prohibits increases in the amount of school district ad valorem taxes that may be imposed on the residence homestead of a person who is 65 years of age or older. The proposed amendment would grant disabled persons much the same beneficial tax treatment that elderly persons are currently granted. ARGUMENTS FOR: Due to inflation, risi ng property values, or increases in tax rates, school district taxes have consistently increased over time. Tax increases are particularly hard on persons on fixed incomes, such as many elderly or disabled persons. Elderly persons are already protected from school tax increases on their homes. The proposed amendment would similarly protect homeowners who are disabled for social security purposes from increases in school district property taxes, allowing them to remain in their homes. The amendment prevents only increases in the amount of school district taxes on the residence homesteads of the disabled and does not relieve disabled homeowners from all of the taxes they must pay to their school district. The amount of tax revenue that will be lost to any particular school district in future years will be minimal and can be made up from other sources of revenue without significantly increasing the tax burdens of other taxpayers. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Limiting the amount of school district taxes on the residence homesteads of the disabled does not affect the total tax burden of the school district but will only shift the tax burden among taxpayers. By limiting increases in the taxes owed by a disabled person, the amendment unfairly shifts a portion of the tax burden to other homeowners and to owners of other types of property, primarily business property, who are not entitled to any limitation on their school district taxes. Regardless of the amount of tax revenue that will be lost by one school district if the amendment is adopted, the total amount lost by all school districts will be significant. In addition, not every school district will be able to increase its tax collections to make up for the lost property tax revenue in future years and will likely look to the state government to make up for their lost property tax revenue at a time when the economy is weak and state funds that are available for education need to be conserved.  22   AMENDMENT NO. 18 The const itut ional amend ment a utho rizi ng the legislature to permit a person to assume an office of a political subdivision without an election if the person is the only candidate to qualify in an election for that office. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment adds Section 13A, Article XVI, Texas Constitution, to authorize the legislature to provide by general law that a person may assume an office of a political subdivision without an election if that person is the only candidate to qualify in an election for that office. ARGUMENTS FOR: By a uthorizing the legislature to allow political subdivisions to avoid the expense of time and money to list unopposed candidates on the ballot and count votes for unopposed candidates, the proposed amendment promotes efficiency in election administration and would help reduce the cost of elections. The amendment would permit the legislature to give election officials greater flexibility in ballot preparation. Simpler, shorter ballots will allow the voter to focus on contested races, without having to sort through the unopposed candidates and will generally reduce voter confusion. The amendment would not interfere with anyone's right to vote. If a candidate is unopposed, and no other candidate, including a write-in candidate, is eligible for election to that office, the race is decided. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Omitting a candidate from the ballot deprives voters of their right to vote for the candidate of their choice. Those who take the time to vote are exercising their right to endorse the candidate they wish to represent them and validate the candidate's election to public office. The right to vote for a candidate should exist regardless of the number of candidates. The amendment would authorize the legislature to deprive candidates of the opportunity to gain visibility by campaigning and make it more difficult for the voters to know who their elected leaders are or what offices are being filled. The amendment is unnecessary because Amendment No. 8, to be submitted to the voters at the same time as this amendment, would more broadly authorize the legislature to provide by general law that a person may assume any office, including an office of a political subdivision, without an election if that person is the only candidate to qualify in an election for that office. If Amendment No. 8 is approved by the voters, this amendment is unnecessary and duplicative, and will add confusion to the Texas Constitution.  23   AMENDMENT NO. 19 The constitutional amendment to repeal the authority of the legislature to provide for the creation of rural fire prevention districts. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment would repeal Section 48-d, Article III, Texas Constitution. That section authorizes the legislature to create rural fire prevention districts supported by a tax on property located in the district. ARGUMENTS FOR: Rural fire prevention districts have been struggling to provide services under the decades-old three-cent cap on property taxes imposed under the state constitution. In contrast, the constitutional cap on property tax rates in emergency services districts is 10 cents. An emergency services district also has statutory authority to impose a limited sales and use tax and may use its tax revenue not only for fire prevention services in rural areas, but also for related emergency services. Thus, emergency services districts have greater financial flexibility to meet the changing needs of rural communities for fire prevention and other emergency services. Since all rural fire prevention districts are converted to emergency services districts on September 1, 2003, and the statute providing for rural fire prevention districts is repealed at that time, the amendment would clean up the state const itut ion b y removin g a provision that the legislature has determined is no longer useful. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: There is no compelling reason to amend the state constitution to repeal the legislature's authority to create rural fire prevention districts. The legislation that converts existing rural fire prevention districts into emergency services districts is not contingent on passa ge of the amendment. The state constitution explicitly provides two options for fire prevention services in rural areas: rural fire prevention districts supported by a property tax at a rate of not more than three cents for each $100 of valuation, and emergency services di st ricts s up po rted by a property tax at a rate of not more than 10 cents for each $100 of valuation. The constitution should maintain the flexibility it currently offers to rural communities to provide fire prevention services under the lower rate cap.  24   AMENDMENT NO. 20 The constitutional amendment authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds or notes not to exceed $250 million payable from the general revenues of the state to provide loans to defense-related communities, that will be repaid by the defense-related community, for economic development projects, including projects that enhance the military value of military installations. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment would add Section 49-n to Article III of the Texas Constitution and permit the legislature to authorize one or more state agencies to issue general obligation bonds or notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250 million to provide loans to defense-related communities for economic development projects that benefit the defense-related comm unit y, including projects that enhance the military value of military installations located in the state. The amendment would authorize the bond proceeds to be deposited in the Texas military valu e revol vi ng lo an accoun t i n t he st ate treasury. ARGUMENTS FOR: The Texas military value revolving loan account would assist local communities in financing projects that would enhance the military value of nearby military installations. Enhancing this value is important because the United States Department of Defense will undergo another round of base realignment and closure in 2005. The military installations located in this state and defense-related businesses are vital to the economy, and improving the military value of Texas military installations will increase the likelihood that such installations will not be closed during the base realignment and closure process. Local communities could borrow money from the Texas military value revolving loan account at a lower rate than the community could borrow money from other sources and, without the resulting cost savings, might not be able to afford to complete projects necessary to enhance the value of nearby military installations. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: The Department of Defense desires to close expensive, unnecessary defense bases, and it does not make sense to spend state money to keep bases that are not needed. Furthermore, the expenditures will not guarantee that the federal government will decide to keep the bases open. At a time when the state is facing increasing needs for services in all areas and state revenues are being strained to meet those needs, the approval of an additional amount of bonds for financing projects that increase the military value of federal military installations does not appear to be practi cal o r necessary.  25   AMENDMENT NO. 21 The constitutional amendment to permit a current or retired faculty member of a public college or university to receive compensation for service on the governing body of a water district. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment amends Section 40(b), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, to permit a faculty member or retired faculty member of a public institution of higher education who also serves as a member of the governing body of a water district created under Section 59, Article XVI, or Section 52, Article III, Texas Constitution, to receive a salary for that service. ARGUMENTS FOR: The proposed amendment would eliminate an antiquated and unnecessary restriction on additional public service by public college and university faculty members. The law currently does not prohibit that service, but discourages it by prohibiting a salary for it, and there is no such salary prohibition applicable to other persons holding full-time jobs, such as federal or private-sector employees. Approval of the amendment would encourage valuable public service by faculty memb ers and greatl y increase the pool of qualified persons able to serve on the governing bodies of the state's hundreds of water districts. The proposed amendment is properly limited to very narrow circumstances. Public college and university faculty members, unlike most other state employees, have more flexible hours and can more easily schedule outside duties in conjunction with their primary jobs. In addition, the exception applies only to water districts, which have limited functions. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: The existing constitutional prohibition against a state employee receiving a salary for serving on the governing body of a political subdivision is intended to ensure that the state employee is committed first and foremost to his or her public employment. If service on the governing body of a water district is a salaried position, the duties of that position are probably subs tanti al eno ugh to potentially interfere with the duties of the faculty member and could potentially reduce the member's commitment to faculty responsibilities. While faculty members of public colleges and universities are able to provide valuable service to local governments because of their valuable skills, knowledge, and experience, other state employees are also well qualified to provide such service and frequently do so without additional compensation. There is no reason to single out faculty members for the special treatment that would become available under the proposed amendment. The inclusion of retired faculty members in the proposed amendment implies that other retired state employees are not entitled to receive a salary for servi ng on a local governin g bod y. If th at in terpretati on is adop ted b y the courts, t he pro posed amend ment w ill a ctual ly discou rage public service on local governing bodies by thousands of well-qualified state retirees.  26   AMENDMENT NO. 22 The constitutional amendment authorizing the appointment of a temporary replacement officer to fill a vacancy created when a public officer enters active duty in the United States armed forces. SUMMARY: The proposed amendment would add Section 72 Constitution to: (1) allow an elected or appointed officer of the state who enters active dut y in th e armed forces of th e Uni ted S tates as a drafted, or activated, to retain the person's office while serving in temporary acting officer to be appointed to perform all the duties of to Article XVI of the Texas or of any political subdivision resu lt of bein g called t o dut y, the military; and (2) allow a the office.  Under the amendment, for an officer other than a member of the legislature, the authority who has the power to appoint a person to fill a vacancy in the office would appoint the temporary acting officer. If a vacancy in th e office wou ld no rmally b e fil led b y a special election, the governor would appoint the temporary acting officer for a state or district office and the governing body of a political subdivision such as a city or county would appoint the temporary acting officer for an office of that political subdivision. For an officer who is a member of the legislature, the amendment authorizes the member of the legislature to appoint a temporary acting representative or senator, subject to approval of the selection by a majority vote of the appropriate house of the legislature. ARGUMENTS FOR: The proposed amendment is necessary to clarify that an elected or appointed officer of the state or a political subdivision does not vacate the person's office when the officer is called to active military duty. Authorizing the appointment of a temporary acting officer would allow for the needs of constituents to continue being served during the officer's temporary leave of absence. State law provides that an employee of the state or of a local governmental entity who leaves employment to enter active military service is entitled to reemployment after the employee completes active military service. Officers of the state or a political subdivision should receive the same benefit after taking a temporary leave of absence to defend the state or nation as a member of the military, and allowing an officer to return to office after completing active military service will encourage public officers to maintain their involvement in the national guard or reserves. ARGUMENTS AGAINST: Authorizing the governor or the governing body of a political subdivision to appoint a temporary replacement for an elected officer deprives the citizens of this state of the right to select the individuals who will represent them. Allowing an officer of the state or of a political subdivision to return to office after the individual completes temporary active duty in the military creates inefficiency in the operation of the office because there is no definite length of time the officer m ay be away on active duty. Without having a definite term of office, fewer qualified individuals will agree to serve as a temporary replacement officer. 03Y776  27"
GX268-07-6830501	AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide certain requirements for new continuing care retirement communities. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. For the purposes of this Act, a continuing care agreement is an agreement to provide a person board and lodging, in addition to care in a nursing facility or assisted living center, as defined in  34-12-1.1, for the duration of the person's life, in consideration for an entrance fee paid to the provider. Section 2. For the purposes of this Act, an entrance fee is an initial or deferred transfer to a provider of a sum of money, or other property, made or promised to be made, as a full or partial consideration for acceptance of the person in the facility under a continuing care agreement, if the amount exceeds five thousand dollars or the sum of periodic charges for three months of residency, whichever is greater. Section 3. For the purposes of this Act, a continuing care retirement community is a facility that offers any person, under a continuing agreement, board and lodging, in addition to care in a nursing facility or assisted living center, regardless of whether the lodging and care is provided at the same location. Section 4. A continuing care retirement community and any agreement it enters into with its residents is not subject to any provision of Title 58 except as contained in this Act. This Act does not provide any exemption for the sale of long-term care or other insurance product to a continuing care retirement community. This Act does not provide any exemption for the sale of long-term care or other insurance products by persons other than the continuing care retirement community to residents of the continuing care retirement community. Section 5. A continuing care retirement community shall provide the following information to any resident or prospective resident: information about all owners and operators of the facility; the SB No. 228 Page 1   affiliation, if any, with other charitable, nonprofit, or religious organizations and any financial obligations of these organizations for the operation of the facility; a description of the goods and services available to the resident as part of the agreement; a listing of services available to residents for extra cost; a description of fees charged to residents; and the most recent financial statement of the provider. Section 6. Any provider proposing to develop a new continuing care retirement community, which has not previously been in operation in this state, shall establish an escrow account with a bank in this state. Any entrance fees or portions of the entrance fees collected from prospective residents before the commencement of operation of the planned facility shall be deposited in this account. Escrowed deposits may not be released to the provider until completion of construction of the facility as evidenced by certificates of occupancy or other permits to commence operation. Deposits shall be released to prospective residents within thirty days of a receipt of a written notice of cancellation. The provider may retain any accrued interest from canceled deposits and a service fee not to exceed five hundred dollars. A copy of the escrow agreement shall be filed with the director of the Division of Insurance. Section 7. Any new continuing care retirement community may not start construction until escrowed deposits of at least ten percent of the proposed entrance fee has been received for at least fifty percent of the proposed living units planned to be constructed. This section does not apply to the building of a continuing care retirement community if the funds used for building such facility are exclusively derived from sources other than prospective residents. Section 8. The provider shall notify the director of the Division of Insurance when the required amount of escrowed deposits have been reached for construction to start. In addition, notice shall be provided to the director of the Division of Insurance when escrowed deposits are released to the provider.

Smith, Jr.  Chairman  State Board of Insurance  1110 San Jacinto Blvd.  Austin, Texas 78701                Opinion No. JM-895        Re:  Requirements of House Bill No. 677 of the 70th Legislature, the Texas Continuing Care Facility Disclosure and Rehabilitation Act (RQ-1227)                     Dear Mr. Smith:       You ask several questions concerning the Texas Continuing Care Facility Disclosure and Rehabilitation Act, which was adopted by House Bill No. 677 of the 70th Legislature and codified as article 8876, V.T.C.S.  It applies to contracts for continuing care entered into on or after September 1, 1987. V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 23.  The statute authorizes the State Board of Insurance to regulate continuing care providers.  V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 3.  A continuing care retirement community provides housing, board, care, and health related services to elderly people who do not want to maintain their own homes but do not need nursing home care.  Texas House of Representatives, Committee on Human Services, Interim Report to the 70th Texas Legislature, ""Continuing Care Communities,"" 119, 124.  It generally consists of residential facilities and a health care center and requires a substantial entrance fee in addition to other monthly fees in return for an assurance of a continuing living arrangement throughout retirement.  House Human Services Committee, Bill Analysis, H.B. No. 677, 70th Leg. (1987).  Because of the considerable investment which continuing care centers require from the elderly, House Bill No. 677 was written to protect the consumer from loss of his investment through fraud or mismanagement.  Id.      The statute defines ""continuing care"" as follows:        [T]he furnishing, to an individual who is not related by consanguinity or affinity to the person furnishing the care, of board and lodging, together with personal care services, and nursing services, medical services, or other health-related services, regardless of whether or not the services and the lodging are provided at the same location, under an agreement that requires the payment of an entrance fee and that is effective either for the life of the individual or for a period of more than one year.    V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 2(2).  The article authorizes the State Board of Insurance to regulate continuing care providers and to adopt rules and take other action necessary to administer and enforce the act.  V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 3.  Continuing care providers are required to receive a certificate of authority from the board.  V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 4.  Providers must deliver a disclosure statement to prospective residents before entering into a contract to provide continuing care and must also establish an entrance fee escrow account.  Id. s 8.  The commissioner of insurance may place a provider under supervision if it is bankrupt or otherwise is financially unable to meet its obligations for continuing care.  Id. s 11.  There are provisions for rehabilitation or liquidation.  Section 13 gives to        [e]ach resident receiving care in a portion of a facility licensed to provide nursing home care, personal care, or custodial care ... all statutory rights provided to nursing home, personal care, or custodial care residents.    The substantive requirements may be enforced by civil and criminal penalties and by equitable proceedings.  Id. ss 15-18.      You first ask about the applicability of the certificate of authority requirement.  This provision states as follows:        Sec. 4. (a) After September 1, 1987, no provider shall offer to the public a contract for continuing care, or construct or acquire a facility for the purpose of providing continuing care, without obtaining a certificate of authority from the board.        (b) The commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the information to be submitted by an applicant for a certificate of authority.        (c) The commissioner, upon receipt of an application for a certificate of authority, shall conduct a hearing on the application in accordance with the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes).  The commissioner shall grant the application if he finds that the applicant or the facility is financially sound;  that the competence, experience, and integrity of the applicant, its board of directors, its officers or its management is such that it would be in the interest of the public to issue a certificate of authority;  and that the applicant is capable of complying with the provisions of this Act.  The commissioner may limit issuance of certificates of authority to incorporated entities.  The commissioner shall issue an order approving or disapproving the application within 180 days of filing.        (d) No certificate of authority issued by the commissioner shall be transferred to a third party except upon approval by the commissioner.        (e) No holder of a certificate of authority shall enter into a contract with a third party for management of the facility unless the commissioner is notified of such contract.        (f) If a provider:  (1) draws upon its entrance fee escrow in an amount greater than provided for in Section 8 of this Act;  (2) draws upon its reserve fund escrow in an amount greater than provided for in Section 9 of this Act;  or (3) engages in a wilful and intentional violation of this Act, the commissioner, after notice and hearing, may suspend or revoke the provider's certificate of authority, in addition to any other remedies provided for in this Act.        (g) The commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority to any facility which is occupied by one or more residents on September 1, 1987, which is under construction on September 1, 1987, or which, prior to September 1, 1987, had incurred substantial financial obligations related to the development of a facility.  Such certificates shall be subject to revocation or suspension as provided for in this section.    V.T.C.S. art. 8876.      Section 4(a) of article 8876, V.T.C.S., requires a provider to obtain a certificate of authority if he offers a contract for continuing care or constructs or acquires a facility for that purpose after September 1, 1987. Section 4(c) establishes procedures and substantive requirements governing issuance of certificates of authority by the insurance commissioner.  Section 4(g), however, states that ""the commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority"" (emphasis added) to any facility which is occupied, under construction, or is the subject of substantial financial obligations by September 1, 1987.      You ask whether a facility described in section 4(g) is required to meet the criteria of section 4(c) or whether instead the commissioner must issue a certificate of authority to such a facility without considering those criteria.      Section 4(g) provides an exception from the criteria in section 4(c) for the three categories of continuing care facilities it describes.  In each category there has been considerable investment in a facility prior to the effective date of article 8876.  V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 23.  As shown by the use of the mandatory ""shall"" in section 4(g), these facilities are entitled to receive a certificate of authority from the commissioner without meeting the substantive requirements set out in section 4(c).      Your next question involves the relationship between section 4(g) of article 8876, V.T.C.S., and section 20, the transition provision.  Section 20 provides as follows:        Sec. 20. (a) A provider who operates a continuing care facility that is in existence on the effective date of this Act must comply with the disclosure and escrow requirements imposed under this Act as provided by this section.        (b) A provider subject to Subsection (a) of this section must file annual revised disclosure statements with the board as provided by Section 7 of this Act beginning with a statement that covers the provider's most recent fiscal year that begins on or after September 1, 1987.        (c) A provider subject to Subsection (a) of this section must comply with the escrow requirements imposed under Sections 8 and 9 of this Act not later than September 1, 1990.  If the commissioner determines that a provider subject to Subsection (a) of this section is unable to comply with this section after making a good faith effort to do so, the commissioner may extend the time for compliance for a reasonable period of time.        (d) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section constitutes a criminal offense under Section 18 of this Act.      You ask whether the entire act as well as the rules adopted by the State Board of Insurance apply to facilities described by section 4(g), or only those delayed requirements listed in section 20.      Section 20 applies to continuing care facilities that are in existence and are being operated on September 1, 1987, the effective date of the act.  House Bill No. 677 as introduced did not include the requirement that continuing care facilities obtain a certificate of authority from the State Board of Insurance.  Bill Analysis, H.B. No. 677, supra.  Thus, the bill as introduced did not include any provision like subsection 4(g) that allowed certain facilities to receive a certificate of authority without making the showing required by section 4(c).  The provision enacted as section 20 of article 8876, V.T.C.S., provided the only exception in the original bill from compliance with the act's requirements on its effective date.  Section 4 was added as part of the Committee Substitute to House Bill No. 677, supra.  Section 4(g) excepts the facilities it describes only from the substantive requirements of section 4(c);  it does not authorize those facilities to meet the statutory requirements on the delayed basis outlined in section 20.      Section 4(g) expressly states that certificates of authority given under its provisions ""shall be subject to revocation or suspension as provided for in this section.""  V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 4(g).  Subsection 4(f) provides for suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority as follows:        (f) If a provider:  (1) draws upon its entrance fee escrow in an amount greater than provided for in Section 8 of this Act;  (2) draws upon its reserve fund escrow in an amount greater than provided for in Section 9 of this Act;  or (3) engages in a wilful and intentional violation of this Act, the commissioner, after notice and hearing, may suspend or revoke the provider's certificate of authority, in addition to any other remedies provided for in this Act.  (Emphasis added.)    V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 4(f).  This provision makes clear the legislature's intent that subsection 4(g) not exempt facilities from provisions of the act other than that describing the criteria for a certificate of authority.      You have not submitted any rules to us, and we can consider the application of rules to section 4(g) facilities only in general terms.  Ordinarily, your rules applicable to other continuing care facilities would also apply to section 4(g) facilities, except for rules implementing section 4(c).      Your third question recognizes that some facilities will be covered by both the exception in section 4(g) and the exception in section 20.  If a facility is occupied by one or more residents on September 1, 1987, it will be ""in existence on the effective date"" of the act and thus will be entitled to a certificate of authority under section 4(g) and will also have the benefit of the transition provision:  section 20.  You ask whether a facility described in section 20 includes only a facility occupied by one or more residents on September 1, 1987, or also includes a facility which is under construction on September 1, 1987 and one which, prior to September 1, 1987, had incurred substantial financial obligations related to the development of the facility.      Section 20(a) applies to ""[a] provider who operates a continuing care facility that is in existence on the effective date of this Act....""  A ""continuing care facility"" is ""a place in which a person undertakes to provide continuing care to an individual.""  V.T.C.S. art. 8876, ss 2(2), (4). ""Operate"" is defined as ""to perform a function.""  Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary.  Section 20(a) applies to a facility where a person is already providing continuing care as of September 1, 1987.  If the facility is merely under construction, or if the provider has done no more than incur substantial financial obligations toward construction of a facility, the facility cannot be used to provide continuing care and is not even in existence.  Section 20(a) does not apply to the latter two categories of ""facility.""      You next ask whether the commissioner, in implementing section 4(g), has discretion to determine whether the financial obligations related to the development of a facility incurred prior to September 1, 1987, are ""substantial.""  V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 4(g).  Whether financial obligations incurred are ""substantial"" is a fact question, which must be answered in relevant cases before a certificate can be issued.  Section 4(b) of article 8876, V.T.C.S., authorizes the commissioner to ""promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the information to be submitted by an applicant for a certificate of authority.""  He is to conduct a hearing on the applications submitted.  V.T.C.S. art. 8876.  The commissioner has access to the information and the procedural framework for deciding whether an applicant for a certificate of authority has incurred substantial financial obligations toward the development of a facility.  This determination is not a matter for the commissioner's unfettered discretion but must be made in accordance with the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, article 6252-13a, V.T.C.S. V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 4(c);  see also V.T.C.S. art. 6252-13a, ss 3(2), (13).      You finally ask several questions about the definitions of ""entrance fee"" and ""continuing care"" in the statute.  Section 2 provides as follows:        (2) 'Continuing care' means the furnishing, to an individual who is not related by consanguinity or affinity to the person furnishing the care, of board and lodging, together with personal care services, and nursing services, medical services, or other health-related services, regardless of whether or not the services and the lodging are provided at the same location, under an agreement that requires the payment of an entrance fee and that is effective either for the life of the individual or for a period of more than one year.        (3) 'Entrance fee' means an initial or deferred transfer of money, or other property valued at an amount in excess of three months' rent, made, or promised to be made as full or partial consideration for acceptance by a provider of a specified individual as a resident in a facility.  (Emphasis added.)    V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 2.      You ask:        Does the use of an agreement that is of less than one years' duration, including a month-to-month contract, but which is guaranteed renewable by the resident, subject a facility to regulation under the act?    Any renewal provision must be evaluated according to its language and its function in the context of the whole contract.  For example, a renewal provision which provides for automatic renewal every month in the absence of notice by the resident or one which provides for renewal on the receipt of each rent check could in effect be a contract for the life of the resident.  The significance of such provisions should be determined on a case by case basis by the commissioner or the board in the exercise of their enforcement powers under the statute.  See V.T.C.S. art. 8876, ss 16, 17.      You next ask:        Does the charging of an upfront fee greater than the amount of three months' rent, but which is called an 'initial fee,' 'deposit,' or 'application fee' and is fully or partially refundable, subject a facility to regulation under the act?    If the fee fits the definition found in section 2(3), it is an entrance fee, even though the provider calls it something else.  The fact that a fee is refundable does not remove it from the definition of ""entrance fee.""  Article 8876, V.T.C.S., contemplates that some providers might charge an entrance fee that is fully or partly refundable.  Section 6(g)(4) requires that a disclosure statement set out        the conditions, if any, under which all or part of the entrance fee is refundable on cancellation of the contract by the provider or by the resident, or in the event of the death of the resident....    V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 6(g)(4).      You next ask:        Does the charging of an entrance fee less than the amount of three months' rent with an additional lump sum fee payable annually, the aggregate of which would be greater than three months' rent, subject a facility to regulation under the act?      An entrance fee includes an ""initial or deferred transfer"" of money or other property as consideration for acceptance of a specified individual as a resident in a facility.  If the additional lump sum fee is part of the consideration for accepting the individual as a resident, it is an ""entrance fee"" even though its payment is deferred.      You next ask:        Does the act impose any duty on the State Board of Insurance or the commissioner to review a facility's arrangements for the purpose of determining applicability of the act to that facility?      We understand your question to relate to financial and contractual arrangements of continuing care providers, and not to the physical premises of continuing care facilities.  The statute imposes the following duty on the State Board of Insurance:        Sec. 3. The State Board of Insurance shall regulate continuing care providers as provided by this Act.  The board may adopt rules and take other action as necessary to administer and enforce this Act.  (Emphasis added.)    V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 3.  The board has a mandatory duty to enforce this statute to protect consumers from the loss of investment that might occur through fraud or mismanagement.  We cannot tell you, as a matter of law, how to exercise your powers and carry out your duties under article 8876, V.T.C.S. That is a matter for the board's discretion.  We note, however, that the board has been given power to make rules and regulations, as well as considerable authority to require the submission of information necessary to carry out its responsibilities.  See, e.g., V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 4(c) (information to be submitted by an applicant for a certificate of authority);  ss 5-7 (recording requirements);  s 16 (conduct of investigations, subpoena power).  See also V.T.C.S. art. 8876, ss 11, 17 (power to act on investigation prompted by complaint).      We also point out that some provisions state how particular powers shall be exercised.  For example, the commissioner shall conduct a hearing on an application for a certificate of authority in accordance with the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, and shall grant the certificate on certain fact findings.  V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 4(c).  In addition, with respect to the requirement that providers file a disclosure statement and revised disclosure statements with the State Board of Insurance,        [t]he commissioner shall review the disclosure statement for completeness but shall not be required to review the disclosure statement for accuracy.    V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 7(c).      Your last question is as follows:        The definitions of 'continuing care' and 'entrance fee' state five elements that describe the type of facilities to be regulated under the Act.  These five elements are as follows:     (1) furnishing board;     (2) furnishing lodging;     (3) furnishing personal care services, and either nursing services, medical services, or other health-related services;     (4) an agreement that is effective either for the life of an individual or for a period of more than one year;  and     (5) requirements of an entrance fee (money or property of value in excess of three months' rent) in the agreement.        Must a facility meet all five requirements in order to be subject to this act?    Your question essentially tracks the definitions of ""continuing care"" and  ""entrance fee"" that are set out in the statute.  See V.T.C.S. art. 8876, s 2(2), (3).  We therefore answer your question in the affirmative:  the five elements you set out must be present for a facility to be a continuing care facility subject to regulation under the statute.  Whether those five elements are present in a given facility must be decided in the context of all relevant facts and circumstances.  Of course, it is the substance of the agreement, not the form, that is determined, and subterfuges will not avoid the statute.       SUMMARY           A continuing care facility described in section 4(g) of article 8876, V.T.C.S., is entitled to receive a certificate of authority without meeting the criteria found in section 4(c) of that statute.  Except for the section 4(c) criteria, the entire statute becomes applicable on its effective date to section 4(g) facilities.  If a facility is merely under construction on September 1, 1987, or if the provider has done no more than incur substantial financial obligations toward construction of a facility, the transition provision found in section 20 is not applicable to it.  The commissioner has authority to make the fact findings necessary to implement section 4(g) of article 8876, V.T.C.S.

This Act does not provide any exemption for the sale of long-term care or other insurance product to a continuing care retirement community. This Act does not provide any exemption for the sale of long-term care or other insurance products by persons other than the continuing care retirement community to residents of the continuing care retirement community.            Section     5.   A continuing care retirement community shall provide the following information to   any resident or prospective resident: information about all owners and operators of the facility; the affiliation, if any, with other charitable, nonprofit, or religious organizations and any financial obligations of these organizations for the operation of the facility; a description of the goods and services available to the resident as part of the agreement; a listing of services available to residents for extra cost; a description of fees charged to residents; and the most recent financial statement of the provider.            Section     6.   Any provider proposing to develop a new continuing care retirement community, which has not previously been in operation in this state, shall establish an escrow account with a bank in this state. Any entrance fees or portions of the entrance fees collected from prospective residents before the commencement of operation of the planned facility shall be deposited in this account. Escrowed deposits may not be released to the provider until completion of construction of the facility as evidenced by certificates of occupancy or other permits to commence operation. Deposits shall be released to prospective residents within thirty days of a receipt of a written notice of cancellation. The provider may retain any accrued interest from canceled deposits and a service fee not to exceed five hundred dollars. A copy of the escrow agreement shall be filed with the director of the Division of Insurance.            Section     7.   Any new continuing care retirement community may not start construction until escrowed deposits of at least ten percent of the proposed entrance fee has been received for at least fifty percent of the proposed living units planned to be constructed. This section does not apply to the building of a continuing care retirement community if the funds used for building such facility are exclusively derived from sources other than prospective residents.            Section     8.   The provider shall notify the director of the Division of Insurance when the required amount of escrowed deposits have been reached for construction to start. In addition, notice shall be provided to the director of the Division of Insurance when escrowed deposits are released to the   provider.

GX238-60-16618879	AMENDED IN ASSEMBLY MARCH 24, 2003 CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE--200304 REGULAR SESSION  ASSEMBLY BILL  No. 205  Introduced by Assembly Members Goldberg, Kehoe, Koretz, Laird, and Leno (Principal coauthor: Assembly Member Wesson) (Principal coauthor: Senator Kuehl) (Coauthors: Assembly Members Chu Bermudez, Chu, Diaz, Dymally, Firebaugh, Frommer, Hancock, Levine, Lieber, Longville, Lowenthal, Nation, Nunez, Oropeza, Pavley, and Steinberg Steinberg, Vargas, and Yee) (Coauthors: Senators Burton, Cedillo, Romero, and Vasconcellos)  January 28, 2003  An act to amend Sections 297, 298, and 298.5 of, to add Sections 299.1, 297.5, 299.2, and 299.3 to, to repeal Section 299.5 of, and to repeal and add Section 299 of, the Family Code, to amend Section 14771 of the Government Code, and to amend Section 18521 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to domestic partnerships. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST  AB 205, as amended, Goldberg. Domestic partners. Existing law provides for the issuance of a marriage license and specifies the rights and obligations of married persons. Existing law also provides for the establishment and the termination of domestic partnerships. Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prepare and distribute forms for creating and terminating domestic partnerships. Existing law specifies the requirements for completing  98   AB 205  --2--  the form necessary to create a domestic partnership and provides that a violation of this provision is a misdemeanor. This bill would enact the California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003. The bill would modify the procedure and the accompanying form for terminating domestic partnerships, and require additional duties of the Secretary of State in relation, as specified. The bill would also revise the requirements for entering into a domestic partnership to require each person to consent to the jurisdiction of the superior courts of this state for the purpose of a proceeding to obtain a judgment of dissolution or nullity of the domestic partnership. The bill would revise the provision described above making it a misdemeanor to violate the provision specifying the requirements for completing the form necessary to create a domestic partnership. The bill would instead specifically provide that filing an intentionally and materially false Declaration of Domestic Partnership would be punishable as a misdemeanor, thereby creating a new crime. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The This bill would extend the rights and duties of marriage to persons registered as domestic partners on and after January 1, 2005. The bill would provide that the superior courts shall have jurisdiction over all proceedings governing the dissolution of domestic partnerships, nullity of domestic partnerships, and legal separation of partners in domestic partnerships. These proceedings would follow the same procedures as the equivalent proceedings with respect to marriage. The bill would provide that a legal union validly formed in another jurisdiction that is substantially equivalent to a domestic partnership would be recognized as a valid domestic partnership in this state. The bill would require the Secretary of State to send a letter on 3 separate, specified occasions to the mailing address of registered domestic partners informing them of these changes, as specified. The bill would also require the Director of General Services, through the forms management center, to provide assistance notice, by January 1, 2005, to state agencies, among others, that in reviewing and revising all public-use forms that refer to or use the terms spouse, husband, wife, father, mother, marriage, or marital status to include , that appropriate references to domestic partner , parent, or domestic partnership be included. The bill would also make related and conforming changes, including , but not limited to, a provision permitting registered domestic partners to file joint or 98   --3--  AB 205  separate state tax returns. The bill would further make specified provisions operative on January 1, 2005. The bill would impose a state-mandated local program by adding to the duties of county clerks. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above. Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: yes. The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 SECTION 1. (a) This act is intended to help California move closer to fulfilling the promises of inalienable rights, liberty, and equality contained in Sections 1 and 7 of Article 1 of the California Constitution by providing all caring and committed couples, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, the opportunity to obtain essential rights, protections, and benefits and to assume corresponding responsibilities, obligations, and duties and to further the state's interest interests in promoting stable and lasting family relationships, and protecting Californians from the economic and social consequences of abandonment, separation, the death of loved ones, and other life crises. (b) The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following: (1) The legal recognition of civil marriage by the state has been the primary and, in a number of instances, the only available source of many rights, protections, benefits, responsibilities, obligations, and duties for caring and committed couples and their families under California law.  98   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  --4--  (2) The state's interest in civil marriage is to encourage close and caring families, to promote stable and lasting family relationships, and to protect family members from economic and social consequences of abandonment, divorce, the death of loved ones, and other life crises. (3) Despite longstanding social and economic discrimination, many lesbian, gay, and bisexual Californians have formed lasting, committed, and caring relationships with persons of the same sex; these couples share lives together, participate in their communities together, and many raise children and care for other dependent family members together. (4) The state has an interest in encouraging close and caring families, promoting stable and lasting family relationships, and protecting all family members from the economic and social consequences of abandonment, separation, the death of loved ones, and other life crises. (5) Without additional legal rights, protections, benefits, responsibilities, obligations, and duties, domestic partners, the children they are raising, and elderly or disabled family members for whom they are caring suffer numerous obstacles and hardship which directly harm them, lead to numerous harms and costs to third parties and to the state, and are inequitable. (6) Expert studies indicate that approximately 400,000 same-sex couples reside in California, many of whom are raising children or caring for elderly or other dependent family members together. (7) In 1999, California took an important step to address the needs of these families by establishing a state-level registry of domestic partnerships, extending the same right of hospital visitation to domestic partners who register with the state as is provided married spouses, and extending health insurance benefits to the registered domestic partners of those employed by state and local governments. In 2001, California provided the following additional legal protections to those in registered domestic partnerships: authority to make health care decisions on behalf of an incapacitated domestic partner; use of sick leave to care for an ill domestic partner or the ill child of a domestic partner; the requirement that insurers offer group health care coverage for domestic partners on comparable terms to that offered for legal dependents of an insured employee or individual subscriber; a 98   --5-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  AB 205  priority position in a proceeding to appoint a conservator for one's domestic partner; inclusion of domestic partners as a designated beneficiary in the state statutory will form; a presumption in favor of a domestic partner to be appointed the administrator of a predeceased partner 's estate; permitting deduction from taxable income of the cost of health insurance for a domestic partner in the calculation of state income taxes; for purposes of eligibility for unemployment compensation, defining good cause for leaving one's job to include relocation of the employment of one's domestic partner; authorizing a domestic partner to file a claim for disability benefits on behalf of an incapacitated partner; the right to sue for wrongful death of one's domestic partner; the right to sue for negligent infliction of emotional distress for witnessing injury to one's domestic partner; and stepparent adoption by a domestic partner. The horrifying loss of American lives, including scores of California residents, on September 11, 2001, confirmed tragically that a large portion of the general population does not prepare wills or other estate plans; in 2002, California extended to registered domestic partners the right to take through intestate succession a share of a predeceased domestic partner's estate. The state also has extended to registered domestic partners rights with respect to residing in senior citizen housing and has authorized several counties to provide death benefits and survivor's allowances to the registered domestic partners of their employees. (8) California has no legitimate state interest in denying to persons in domestic partnerships and their children and dependent family members the opportunity to obtain the additional rights, protections, benefits, responsibilities, obligations, and duties they currently are denied, including, without limitation, all of the following: (A) Laws relating to domestic relations, including, but not limited to, rights and obligations of financial support during and after the relationship, community property, and evidentiary privileges. (B) Laws relating to child custody, visitation, and duties of financial support of children. (C) Laws relating to title and other incidents of the acquisition, ownership, or transfer of real or personal property during life or at death, as well as laws relating to access to student family housing, senior citizen housing, and rent control protections. 98   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  --6--  (D) Laws relating to obligations to make disclosures regarding spousal relationships and to take other steps to prevent conflicts of interest and self-dealing. (E) Laws relating to government benefits, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, public assistance, transfer of licenses upon death, and the ability to apply for absentee ballots and other documents for a spouse. (F) Laws relating to taxes, including, but not limited to, joint filing of income tax returns, marital tax exemptions, estate tax exemptions, and nonreassessment of real property upon a spouse's death. (G) Laws relating to health insurance coverage for family members, family care and medical leave, bereavement leave, coverage of family members under medical, dental, life, and disability insurance, and spousal pension rights and death benefits. (H) Laws relating to legal claims related to, or dependent upon, family status, including, but not limited to, claims for loss of consortium, and victim's compensation. (I) Laws relating to anatomical gifts, consent to autopsy and disposition of remains, and rights of burial in family cemeteries. (J) Laws prohibiting marital status discrimination. (9) There is no legitimate reason to limit the rights, protections, and benefits, or the responsibilities, obligations, and duties provided to or imposed upon registered domestic partners as those currently provided to or imposed upon them. California likewise has no legitimate reason not to provide parity between the rights, protections, and benefits, as well as the responsibilities, obligations, and duties, of registered domestic partners and those who enter a civil marriage. (10) Subjecting registered domestic partners to additional legal responsibilities, obligations, and duties, as well as providing registered domestic partners additional rights, protections, and benefits, will both reduce certain expenses for the state and increase certain revenues to the state. Expenses will be reduced, among other ways, because registered domestic partners will have an enforceable duty of support for their partners and the income of domestic partners will be able to be considered in assessing an individual's qualification for means-tested government assistance programs. Revenues will be increased, among other ways, because treating domestic partners for income tax purposes in the same 98   --7-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  AB 205  ways as those who are married will increase the amount of income tax that is due in many instances. (11) The California Constitution provides that all people have inalienable rights, including pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness and privacy; that no person may be deprived of liberty without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws; and that no citizen or class of citizens may be granted privileges or immunities not granted on the same terms to all citizens. Moreover, California's statutes and case law increasingly have acknowledged the state's interest in recognizing same-sex relationships, providing individuals in these relationships treatment under state law comparable to that afforded persons in different-sex relationships who have married, and ending discrimination on the bases of sex and sexual orientation. (12) Expanding the rights and responsibilities of registered domestic partners would further California's interest in encouraging close and caring families, promoting stable and lasting family relationships, and protecting family members from economic and social consequences of abandonment, separation, the death of loved ones, and other life crises; would protect these couples, the children they are raising, third parties, and the state against numerous harms and costs; would reduce discrimination on the bases of sex and sexual orientation; and would provide these couples the opportunity to obtain additional rights, protections, benefits, responsibilities, obligations, and duties. that despite longstanding social and economic discrimination, many lesbian, gay, and bisexual Californians have formed lasting, committed, and caring relationships with persons of the same sex. These couples share lives together, participate in their communities together, and many raise children and care for other dependent family members together. Many of these couples have sought to protect each other and their family members by registering as domestic partners with the State of California and, as a result, have received certain basic legal rights. Expanding the rights and creating responsibilities of registered domestic partners would further California's interests in promoting family relationships and protecting family members during life crises, and would reduce discrimination on the bases of sex and sexual orientation in a manner consistent with the requirements of the California Constitution. 98   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  --8--  (c) This act is not intended to repeal or adversely affect any other ways in which relationships between adults may be recognized, or given effect in California, or the legal consequences of those relationships, including, among other things, civil marriage, enforcement of palimony agreements, enforcement of powers of attorney, appointment of conservators or guardians, and petitions for second parent or limited consent adoption. SEC. 2. This act shall be known and may be cited as ``The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003.'' SEC. 3. Section 297 of the Family Code is amended to read: 297. (a) Domestic partners are two adults who have chosen to share one another 's lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring. (b) A domestic partnership shall be established in California when all of the following requirements are met: (1) Both persons have a common residence. (2) Neither person is married or a member of another domestic partnership that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity. (3) The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in this state. (4) Both persons are at least 18 years of age. (5) Either of the following: (A) Both persons are members of the same sex. (B) One or both of the persons meet the eligibility criteria under Title II of the Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 402(a) for old-age insurance benefits or Title XVI of the Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 1381 for aged individuals. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, persons of opposite sexes may not constitute a domestic partnership unless one or both of the persons are over the age of 62. (6) Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership. (7) Both persons file a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State pursuant to this division. (c) ``Have a common residence'' means that both domestic partners share the same residence. It is not necessary that the legal right to possess the common residence be in both of their names. 98   --9-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  AB 205  Two people have a common residence even if one or both have additional residences. Domestic partners do not cease to have a common residence if one leaves the common residence but intends to return. SEC. 4. Section 297.5 is added to the Family Code, to read: 297.5. (a) Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether they derive from statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, common law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are granted to and imposed upon spouses in a civil marriage. (b) Former registered domestic partners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether they derive from statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, common law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are granted to and imposed upon former spouses in a civil marriage. (c) A surviving registered domestic partner, following the death of the other partner, shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether they derive from statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, common law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are granted to and imposed upon a widow or a widower of a civil marriage. (d) The rights and obligations of registered domestic partners with respect to a child of either of them shall be the same as those of married spouses. The rights and obligations of former or surviving registered domestic partners with respect to a child of either of them shall be the same as those of former or surviving spouses in a civil marriage. (e) To the extent that provisions of California law adopt, refer to, or rely upon, provisions of federal law in a way that otherwise would cause registered domestic partners to be treated differently than spouses in a civil marriage, registered domestic partners shall be treated by California law as if federal law recognized a domestic partnership in the same manner as California law.  98   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  -- 10 --  (f) No public agency in this state may discriminate against any person or couple on the ground that the person or couple is in a registered domestic partnership rather than in a civil marriage. (g) Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights regarding nondiscrimination as those provided to spouses in a civil marriage. SEC. 5. Section 298 of the Family Code is amended to read: 298. (a) The Secretary of State shall prepare forms entitled ``Declaration of Domestic Partnership'' and ``Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership'' to meet the requirements of this division. These forms shall require the signature and seal of an acknowledgment by a notary public to be binding and valid. (b) (1) The Secretary of State shall distribute these forms to each county clerk. These forms shall be available to the public at the office of the Secretary of State and each county clerk. (2) The Secretary of State shall, by regulation, establish fees for the actual costs of processing each of these forms, and shall charge these fees to persons filing the forms. (c) The Declaration of Domestic Partnership shall require each person who wants to become a domestic partner to (1) state that he or she meets the requirements of Section 297 at the time the form is signed, (2) provide a mailing address, (3) state that he or she consents to the jurisdiction of the Superior Courts of California for the purpose of a proceeding to obtain a judgment of dissolution or nullity of the domestic partnership or for legal separation of partners in the domestic partnership even if one or both partners ceases to be a resident of, or to maintain a domicile in, this state, (4) sign the form with a declaration that representations made therein are true, correct, and contain no material omissions of fact to the best knowledge and belief of the applicant, and (5) have a notary public acknowledge his or her signature. Both partners' signatures shall be affixed to one Declaration of Domestic Partnership form, which form shall then be transmitted to the Secretary of State according to the instructions provided on the form. Filing an intentionally and materially false Declaration of Domestic Partnership shall be punishable as a misdemeanor. SEC. 5. SEC. 6. Section 298.5 of the Family Code is amended to read:  98   -- 11 -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  AB 205  298.5. (a) Two persons desiring to become domestic partners may complete and file a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State. (b) The Secretary of State shall register the Declaration of Domestic Partnership in a registry for those partnerships, and shall return a copy of the registered form to the domestic partners at the mailing address provided by the domestic partners. (c) No person who has filed a Declaration of Domestic Partnership may file a new Declaration of Domestic Partnership or enter a civil marriage with someone other than their registered domestic partner unless the most recent domestic partnership has been terminated or a final judgment of dissolution or nullity of the most recent domestic partnership has been entered. This prohibition does not apply if the previous domestic partnership ended because one of the partners died. SEC. 6. SEC. 7. Section 299 of the Family Code is repealed. SEC. 7. SEC. 8. Section 299 is added to the Family Code, to read: 299. (a) A domestic partnership may be terminated without filing a proceeding for dissolution of domestic partnership by the filing of a Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State pursuant to this section, provided that all of the following conditions exist at the time of the filing: (1) The Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership is signed by both domestic partners. (2) There are no children of the relationship of the parties born before or after registration of the domestic partnership or adopted by the parties after registration of the domestic partnership, and neither of the domestic partners, to their knowledge, is pregnant. (3) The domestic partnership is not more than five years in duration. (4) Neither party has any interest in real property wherever situated, with the exception of the lease of a residence occupied by either party which satisfies the following requirements: (A) The lease does not include an option to purchase. (B) The lease terminates within one year from the date of filing of the Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership. (5) There are no unpaid obligations in excess of the amount which would preclude the filing of a summary dissolution 98   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  -- 12 --  pursuant to paragraph (6) of subdivision (a) of Section 2400, as adjusted by subdivision (b) of Section 2400, incurred by either or both of the parties after registration of the domestic partnership, excluding the amount of any unpaid obligation with respect to an automobile. (6) The total fair market value of community property assets, excluding all encumbrances and automobiles, including any deferred compensation or retirement plan, is less than the amount which would preclude the filing of a summary dissolution pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 2400, as adjusted by subdivision (b) of Section 2400, and neither party has separate property assets, excluding all encumbrances and automobiles, in excess of that amount. (7) The parties have executed an agreement setting forth the division of assets and the assumption of liabilities of the community property, and have executed any documents, title certificates, bills of sale, or other evidence of transfer necessary to effectuate the agreement. (8) The parties waive any rights to spousal support. (9) The parties have read and understand a brochure prepared by the Secretary of State describing the requirements, nature, and effect of terminating a domestic partnership. (10) Both parties desire that the domestic partnership be terminated.

The effect of termination of a domestic partnership pursuant to this section shall be the same as, and shall be treated for all purposes as, the entry of a judgment of dissolution of a domestic partnership. (c) The termination of a domestic partnership pursuant to this section does not prejudice nor bar the rights of either of the parties to institute an action to set aside the termination for fraud, duress, mistake, or any other ground recognized at law or in equity.

The dissolution of a domestic partnership, nullity of a domestic partnership, and legal separation of partners in a domestic partnership shall follow the same procedures, and the partners shall possess the same rights, protections, and benefits, and be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties, as apply to the dissolution of marriage, nullity of marriage, and legal separation of spouses in a marriage, respectively, except as provided in subdivision (a), and except that, in accordance with the consent acknowledged by domestic partners in the Declaration of Domestic Partnership form, proceedings for dissolution, nullity, or legal separation of a domestic partnership registered in this state may be filed in the superior courts of this state even if neither domestic partner is a resident of, or maintains a domicile in, the state at the time the proceedings are filed.

The rights and obligations of former or surviving registered domestic partners with respect to a child of either of them shall be the same as those of former or surviving spouses in a civil marriage. (e) To the extent that provisions of California law adopt, refer to, or rely upon, provisions of federal law in a way that otherwise would cause registered domestic partners to be treated differently than spouses in a civil marriage, registered domestic partners shall be treated by California law as if federal law recognized a domestic partnership in the same manner as California law. (f) No public agency in this state may discriminate against any person or couple on the ground that the person or couple is in a registered domestic partnership rather than in a civil marriage. (g) Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights regarding nondiscrimination as those provided to spouses in a civil marriage. SEC. 9. Section 299.2 is added to the Family Code, to read: 299.2. (a) A domestic partnership is not invalid because one or both of the partners has at any time changed his or her gender.

SEC. 10. Section 299.3 is added to the Family Code, to read: 299.3. (a) On or before June 30, 2004, and again on or before December 1, 2004, and again on or before January 31, 2005, the Secretary of State shall send the following letter to the mailing address on file of each registered domestic partner who registered more than one month prior to each of those dates:  98   -- 15 -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 ``Dear Registered Domestic Partner:  AB 205  This letter is being sent to all persons who have registered with the Secretary of State as a domestic partner. Effective January 1, 2005, California's law related to the rights and responsibilities of registered domestic partners will change (or, if you are receiving this letter after that date, the law has changed, as of January 1, 2005). With this new legislation, for purposes of California law, domestic partners will have a great many new rights and responsibilities, including laws governing community property and taxation, those governing property transfer, those regarding duties of mutual financial support and mutual responsibilities for certain debts to third parties, and many others. The way domestic partnerships are terminated is also changing. After January 1, 2005, under certain circumstances, it will be necessary to participate in a dissolution proceeding in court to end a domestic partnership. Domestic partners who do not wish to be subject to these new rights and responsibilities MUST terminate their domestic partnership before January 1, 2005. Under the law in effect until January 1, 2005, your domestic partnership is automatically terminated if you or your partner marry or die while you are registered as domestic partners. It is also terminated if you send to your partner or your partner sends to you, by certified mail, a notice terminating the domestic partnership, or if you and your partner no longer share a common residence. In all cases, you are required to file a Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership. If you do not terminate your domestic partnership before January 1, 2005, as provided above, you will be subject to these new rights and responsibilities and, under certain circumstances, you will only be able to terminate your domestic partnership, other than as a result of domestic partner's death, by the filing of a court action. If you have any questions about any of these changes, please consult an attorney. If you cannot find an attorney in your locale, please contact your county bar association for a referral.

The Secretary of State also shall attach the Notice to the Declaration of Domestic Partnership form that is provided to the general public on the Secretary of State's Web site: ``NOTICE TO POTENTIAL DOMESTIC PARTNER REGISTRANTS As of January 1, 2005, California's law of domestic partnership will change. Beginning at that time, for purposes of California law, domestic partners will have a great many new rights and responsibilities, including laws governing the community property and taxation, those governing property transfer, those regarding duties of mutual financial support and mutual responsibilities for certain debts to third parties, and many others. The way domestic partnerships are terminated will also change. Unlike current law, which allows partners to end their partnership simply by filing a ``Termination of Domestic Partnership'' form with the Secretary of State, after January 1, 2005, it will be necessary under certain circumstances to participate in a dissolution proceeding in court to end a domestic partnership.

Itemized billing requirements.    A continuing care retirement community subject to the provisions of this chapter is required to furnish an item-by-item billing for all charges to the resident or the person paying the bill upon his request unless the items and charges are included in the continuing care contract.  Items which remain unpaid are not required to be itemized again.  A request for itemized billing remains in effect until further notification by the resident or person paying the bill.     SECTION  37-11-80.   Regulations;  examination of affairs of retirement community and health care providers;  communities and providers to submit books and records.    The department shall promulgate regulations in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act as it considers necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.    The department may make an examination of the affairs of a continuing care retirement community and the health care and health-related services providers with whom the organization has contracts, agreements, or other arrangements as often as reasonably is necessary to ensure that the operator can meet his obligations to residents and otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter.    Continuing care retirement communities and health care providers examined pursuant to this section shall submit books and records needed to determine the continuing care retirement community's financial soundness.  The department is responsible for the expenses of examinations under this section.     SECTION  37-11-90.   Certain entrance fees to be placed in escrow account;  release of funds;  exemptions from provisions of this section.     (A) A continuing care retirement community is exempt from the provisions of this section if:    (1) it has been operating for at least five years;    (2) for the previous six months it has maintained at least the minimum occupancy rate estimated in its financial feasibility study to achieve a break-even cash flow operating level or seventy-five percent occupancy, whichever is less.    (B) If an entrance fee is received by the operator before the date the resident is permitted to occupy a living unit in the facility, the total amount must be placed in an escrow account with a trust institution.  These funds may be released only as follows:    (1) If the entrance fee applies to a living unit that previously has been occupied in the facility, the entrance fee must be released to the operator when the living unit becomes available for occupancy by the new resident.    (2) If the entrance fee applies to a living unit which previously has not been occupied by a resident, the nonrefundable portion, if any, of the entrance fee must be released to the operator when the living unit becomes available for occupancy.  The refundable portion, if any, of the entrance fee must be released to the operator when the escrow agent is satisfied that:    (a) construction or purchase of the living unit has been completed, and an occupancy permit, if applicable, covering the living unit has been issued by the local government having authority to issue the permit.    (b) a commitment has been received by the operator for a permanent mortgage loan or other long-term financing, and conditions of the commitment before disbursement of funds have been satisfied substantially.    (c) aggregate entrance fees received or receivable by the operator pursuant to binding continuing care retirement community contracts, plus the anticipated proceeds of any first mortgage loan or other long-term financing commitment, are equal to not less than ninety percent of the aggregate cost of constructing or purchasing, equipping, and furnishing the facility plus not less than ninety percent of the funds estimated in the financial feasibility study required by Section 37-11-30 to be necessary to fund cash shortages during start-up and assure full performance of the obligations of the operator pursuant to continuing care retirement community contracts.    (C) Upon receipt by the escrow agent of a request by the operator for the release of the escrow funds, the escrow agent shall approve release of the funds within five working days unless the escrow agent finds that the requirements of subsection (B) have not been met and notifies the operator of the basis for this finding.  The request for release of the escrow funds must be accompanied by documentation the trust institution requires.    If the operator fails to meet the requirements for release of funds held in this escrow account within a time period the escrow agent considers reasonable, the funds must be returned by the escrow agent to the persons who have made payment to the operator.  The escrow agent shall notify the operator of the length of this time period when the operator requests release of the funds.    An entrance fee held in escrow may be returned by the escrow agent to the person who made payment to the operator at any time upon receipt by the escrow agent of notice from the operator that this person is entitled to a refund of the entrance fee.     SECTION  37-11-95.   Approval required prior to declaring or distributing dividend or similar distribution.     (A) An operator shall obtain approval from the department before declaring or distributing a dividend or similar distribution which generates a retained deficit or increases an existing retained deficit.    (B) The department's approval required under subsection (A) must be given within thirty days from the date of the request unless the department determines in writing that the distribution is not reasonable in relation to the operator's or facility's outstanding liabilities or would otherwise affect the financial soundness of the operator or the facility.     SECTION  37-11-100.   Denial, suspension, or revocation of license;  monetary penalties for violations.    The department, upon proper notice and hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act and department regulations, may deny, suspend, or revoke licenses issued under this chapter or assess a monetary penalty for violations of provisions under this chapter or the regulations promulgated under this chapter.     SECTION  37-11-105.   Financial plan in case of insolvency or danger of insolvency;  penalty for failure to implement approved plan.     (A) At any time when the department has reason to believe that the operator is insolvent, is in imminent danger of becoming insolvent, is in a financially unsound or unsafe condition, or that a continuing care retirement community's financial condition is such that it may otherwise be unable to fully perform its obligations pursuant to continuing care contracts, the department in addition to other remedies may require the operator to submit for approval within sixty days a financial plan detailing the method by which the operator proposes to overcome the deficiencies noted by the department.  The department shall approve or disapprove the plan within thirty days of the receipt.    (B) If the plan is approved, the operator immediately shall implement the plan.    (C) If the plan is disapproved or if at any time after approval the department determines that the plan is not being fully implemented, the department may require the operator to obtain new or additional management capability to solve its difficulties.  The department must give the reorganized management a reasonable period of time, as determined by the department, to develop a plan which, subject to the approval of the department, will reasonably assure that the operator will meet its responsibilities under the law.  The deadlines for action described in this subsection may be extended upon mutual agreement of the operator and the department.    (D) Failure to implement the plan may result in suspension or revocation of a license.     SECTION  37-11-110.   Appeals by applicants.    An applicant or licensee who is dissatisfied with a decision of the department as a result of the hearing provided for by Section 37-11-100 may appeal to the appropriate court for judicial review pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act.     SECTION  37-11-120.   Injunctions;  criminal penalties.    The department, in accordance with the laws of the State governing injunctions and other processes, may maintain an action in the name of the State against a person for establishing, conducting, managing, or operating a facility without obtaining a license as provided in this chapter.  In charging a defendant in a complaint in the action, it is sufficient to charge that the defendant, upon a certain day and in a certain county, established, conducted, managed, or operated the facility or program without a license without asserting further or more particular facts concerning the charge.    A person violating the provisions of this chapter or regulations promulgated under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than ten thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than one year for each offense.  Each day the facility or program operates without a license is considered a separate offense.     SECTION  37-11-130.   Waiver of certain requirements for certain retirement communities.    The department may waive any of the requirements of Section 37-11-30(B) for a continuing care retirement community in operation as of the effective date of this chapter.     SECTION  37-11-135.   Exemptions.    A continuing care retirement community which does not require payment of an entrance fee is exempt from the requirements of this chapter.     SECTION  37-11-140.   Effective date of application of certain provisions of chapter to certain continuing care retirement communities.     (A) A continuing care retirement community in operation, or for which binding financial commitments have been made, as of the effective date of this chapter is not required to meet the criteria established by the department pursuant to Section 37-11-40(1), (2), and (3) and Section 37-11-50(2) and (3) until July 1, 1992.    (B) A continuing care retirement community in operation, or for which binding financial commitments have been made, as of the effective date of this chapter, is exempt from the requirements of Section 37-11-90(B)(2) until July 1, 1994.    (C) The provisions of Section 37-11-35 do not apply to a continuing care contract entered into before the effective date of this chapter.    (D) The provisions of subsections (A), (B), and (C) do not limit the department's authority to deny, suspend, or revoke a license or assess a monetary penalty if it finds fraud or gross financial mismanagement.

GX237-99-7413308	CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE--200304 REGULAR SESSION  ASSEMBLY BILL  No. 205  Introduced by Assembly Members Goldberg, Kehoe, Koretz, Laird, and Leno (Principal coauthor: Assembly Member Wesson) (Principal coauthor: Senator Kuehl) (Coauthors: Assembly Members Chu, Hancock, Levine, Lieber, Longville, Lowenthal, Nation, Nunez, Oropeza, Pavley, and Steinberg) (Coauthors: Senators Burton, Cedillo, and Vasconcellos)  January 28, 2003  An act to amend Sections 297, 298, and 298.5 of, to add Sections 299.1, 299.2, and 299.3 to, and to repeal and add Section 299 of, the Family Code, to amend Section 14771 of the Government Code, and to amend Section 18521 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to domestic partnerships. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST  AB 205, as introduced, Goldberg. Domestic partners. Existing law provides for the issuance of a marriage license and specifies the rights and obligations of married persons. Existing law also provides for the establishment and the termination of domestic partnerships. Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prepare and distribute forms for creating and terminating domestic partnerships. Existing law specifies the requirements for completing the form necessary to create a domestic partnership and provides that a violation of this provision is a misdemeanor. This bill would enact the California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003. The bill would modify the procedure and 99   AB 205  --2--  the accompanying form for terminating domestic partnerships, and require additional duties of the Secretary of State in relation, as specified. The bill would also revise the requirements for entering into a domestic partnership to require each person to consent to the jurisdiction of the superior courts of this state for the purpose of a proceeding to obtain a judgment of dissolution or nullity of the domestic partnership. The bill would revise the provision described above making it a misdemeanor to violate the provision specifying the requirements for completing the form necessary to create a domestic partnership. The bill would instead specifically provide that filing an intentionally and materially false Declaration of Domestic Partnership would be punishable as a misdemeanor, thereby creating a new crime. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would extend the rights and duties of marriage to persons registered as domestic partners on and after January 1, 2005. The bill would provide that the superior courts shall have jurisdiction over all proceedings governing the dissolution of domestic partnerships, nullity of domestic partnerships, and legal separation of partners in domestic partnerships. These proceedings would follow the same procedures as the equivalent proceedings with respect to marriage. The bill would provide that a legal union validly formed in another jurisdiction that is substantially equivalent to a domestic partnership would be recognized as a valid domestic partnership in this state. The bill would require the Secretary of State to send a letter on 3 separate, specified occasions to the mailing address of registered domestic partners informing them of these changes, as specified. The bill would also require the Director of General Services, through the forms management center, to provide assistance, by January 1, 2005, to state agencies, among others, in reviewing and revising all public-use forms that refer to or use the terms spouse, husband, wife, marriage, or marital status to include references to domestic partner or domestic partnership. The bill would also make related and conforming changes, including a provision permitting registered domestic partners to file joint or separate state tax returns. The bill would impose a state-mandated local program by adding to the duties of county clerks. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund 99   --3--  AB 205  to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000. This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above. Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: yes. The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 SECTION 1. (a) This act is intended to help California move closer to fulfilling the promises of inalienable rights, liberty, and equality contained in Sections 1 and 7 of Article 1 of the California Constitution by providing all caring and committed couples, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, the opportunity to obtain essential rights, protections, and benefits and to assume corresponding responsibilities, obligations, and duties and to further the state's interest in promoting stable and lasting family relationships, and protecting Californians from the economic and social consequences of abandonment, separation, the death of loved ones, and other life crises. (b) The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following: (1) The legal recognition of civil marriage by the state has been the primary and, in a number of instances, the only available source of many rights, protections, benefits, responsibilities, obligations, and duties for caring and committed couples and their families under California law. (2) The state's interest in civil marriage is to encourage close and caring families, to promote stable and lasting family relationships, and to protect family members from economic and social consequences of abandonment, divorce, the death of loved ones, and other life crises. (3) Despite longstanding social and economic discrimination, many lesbian, gay, and bisexual Californians have formed lasting, committed, and caring relationships with persons of the same sex; 99   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  --4--  these couples share lives together, participate in their communities together, and many raise children and care for other dependent family members together. (4) The state has an interest in encouraging close and caring families, promoting stable and lasting family relationships, and protecting all family members from the economic and social consequences of abandonment, separation, the death of loved ones, and other life crises. (5) Without additional legal rights, protections, benefits, responsibilities, obligations, and duties, domestic partners, the children they are raising, and elderly or disabled family members for whom they are caring suffer numerous obstacles and hardship which directly harm them, lead to numerous harms and costs to third parties and to the state, and are inequitable. (6) Expert studies indicate that approximately 400,000 same-sex couples reside in California, many of whom are raising children or caring for elderly or other dependent family members together. (7) In 1999, California took an important step to address the needs of these families by establishing a state-level registry of domestic partnerships, extending the same right of hospital visitation to domestic partners who register with the state as is provided married spouses, and extending health insurance benefits to the registered domestic partners of those employed by state and local governments. In 2001, California provided the following additional legal protections to those in registered domestic partnerships: authority to make health care decisions on behalf of an incapacitated domestic partner; use of sick leave to care for an ill domestic partner or the ill child of a domestic partner; the requirement that insurers offer group health care coverage for domestic partners on comparable terms to that offered for legal dependents of an insured employee or individual subscriber; a priority position in a proceeding to appoint a conservator for one's domestic partner; inclusion of domestic partners as a designated beneficiary in the state statutory will form; a presumption in favor of a domestic partner to be appointed the administrator of a predeceased partner 's estate; permitting deduction from taxable income of the cost of health insurance for a domestic partner in the calculation of state income taxes; for purposes of eligibility for unemployment compensation, defining good cause for leaving 99   --5-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  AB 205  one's job to include relocation of the employment of one's domestic partner; authorizing a domestic partner to file a claim for disability benefits on behalf of an incapacitated partner; the right to sue for wrongful death of one's domestic partner; the right to sue for negligent infliction of emotional distress for witnessing injury to one's domestic partner; and stepparent adoption by a domestic partner. The horrifying loss of American lives, including scores of California residents, on September 11, 2001, confirmed tragically that a large portion of the general population does not prepare wills or other estate plans; in 2002, California extended to registered domestic partners the right to take through intestate succession a share of a predeceased domestic partner's estate. The state also has extended to registered domestic partners rights with respect to residing in senior citizen housing and has authorized several counties to provide death benefits and survivor's allowances to the registered domestic partners of their employees. (8) California has no legitimate state interest in denying to persons in domestic partnerships and their children and dependent family members the opportunity to obtain the additional rights, protections, benefits, responsibilities, obligations, and duties they currently are denied, including, without limitation, all of the following: (A) Laws relating to domestic relations, including, but not limited to, rights and obligations of financial support during and after the relationship, community property, and evidentiary privileges. (B) Laws relating to child custody, visitation, and duties of financial support of children. (C) Laws relating to title and other incidents of the acquisition, ownership, or transfer of real or personal property during life or at death, as well as laws relating to access to student family housing, senior citizen housing, and rent control protections. (D) Laws relating to obligations to make disclosures regarding spousal relationships and to take other steps to prevent conflicts of interest and self-dealing. (E) Laws relating to government benefits, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, public assistance, transfer of licenses upon death, and the ability to apply for absentee ballots and other documents for a spouse.  99   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  --6--  (F) Laws relating to taxes, including, but not limited to, joint filing of income tax returns, marital tax exemptions, estate tax exemptions, and nonreassessment of real property upon a spouse's death. (G) Laws relating to health insurance coverage for family members, family care and medical leave, bereavement leave, coverage of family members under medical, dental, life, and disability insurance, and spousal pension rights and death benefits. (H) Laws relating to legal claims related to, or dependent upon, family status, including, but not limited to, claims for loss of consortium, and victim's compensation. (I) Laws relating to anatomical gifts, consent to autopsy and disposition of remains, and rights of burial in family cemeteries. (J) Laws prohibiting marital status discrimination. (9) There is no legitimate reason to limit the rights, protections, and benefits, or the responsibilities, obligations, and duties provided to or imposed upon registered domestic partners as those currently provided to or imposed upon them. California likewise has no legitimate reason not to provide parity between the rights, protections, and benefits, as well as the responsibilities, obligations, and duties, of registered domestic partners and those who enter a civil marriage. (10) Subjecting registered domestic partners to additional legal responsibilities, obligations, and duties, as well as providing registered domestic partners additional rights, protections, and benefits, will both reduce certain expenses for the state and increase certain revenues to the state. Expenses will be reduced, among other ways, because registered domestic partners will have an enforceable duty of support for their partners and the income of domestic partners will be able to be considered in assessing an individual's qualification for means-tested government assistance programs. Revenues will be increased, among other ways, because treating domestic partners for income tax purposes in the same ways as those who are married will increase the amount of income tax that is due in many instances. (11) The California Constitution provides that all people have inalienable rights, including pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness and privacy; that no person may be deprived of liberty without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws; and that no citizen or class of citizens may be granted privileges 99   --7-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  AB 205  or immunities not granted on the same terms to all citizens. Moreover, California's statutes and case law increasingly have acknowledged the state's interest in recognizing same-sex relationships, providing individuals in these relationships treatment under state law comparable to that afforded persons in different-sex relationships who have married, and ending discrimination on the bases of sex and sexual orientation. (12) Expanding the rights and responsibilities of registered domestic partners would further California's interest in encouraging close and caring families, promoting stable and lasting family relationships, and protecting family members from economic and social consequences of abandonment, separation, the death of loved ones, and other life crises; would protect these couples, the children they are raising, third parties, and the state against numerous harms and costs; would reduce discrimination on the bases of sex and sexual orientation; and would provide these couples the opportunity to obtain additional rights, protections, benefits, responsibilities, obligations, and duties. (c) This act is not intended to repeal or adversely affect any other ways in which relationships between adults may be recognized, or given effect in California, or the legal consequences of those relationships, including, among other things, civil marriage, enforcement of palimony agreements, enforcement of powers of attorney, appointment of conservators or guardians, and petitions for second parent or limited consent adoption. SEC. 2. This act shall be known and may be cited as ``The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003.'' SEC. 3. Section 297 of the Family Code is amended to read: 297. (a) Domestic partners are two adults who have chosen to share one another 's lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring. (b) A domestic partnership shall be established in California when all of the following requirements are met: (1) Both persons have a common residence. (2) Both persons agree to be jointly responsible for each other's basic living expenses incurred during the domestic partnership. (3) Neither person is married or a member of another domestic partnership that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity. 99   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  --8--  (4) (3) The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in this state. (5) (4) Both persons are at least 18 years of age. (6) (5) Either of the following: (A) Both persons are members of the same sex. (B) One or both of the persons meet the eligibility criteria under Title II of the Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 402(a) for old-age insurance benefits or Title XVI of the Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 1381 for aged individuals. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, persons of opposite sexes may not constitute a domestic partnership unless one or both of the persons are over the age of 62. (7) (6) Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership. (8) Neither person has previously filed a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State pursuant to this division that has not been terminated under Section 299. (9) (7) Both persons file a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State pursuant to this division. (c) ``Have a common residence'' means that both domestic partners share the same residence. It is not necessary that the legal right to possess the common residence be in both of their names. Two people have a common residence even if one or both have additional residences. Domestic partners do not cease to have a common residence if one leaves the common residence but intends to return. (d) ``Basic living expenses'' means shelter, utilities, and all other costs directly related to the maintenance of the common household of the common residence of the domestic partners. It also means any other cost, such as medical care, if some or all of the cost is paid as a benefit because a person is another person's domestic partner. (e) ``Joint responsibility'' means that each partner agrees to provide for the other partner 's basic living expenses if the partner 99   --9-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  AB 205  is unable to provide for herself or himself. Persons to whom these expenses are owed may enforce this responsibility if, in extending credit or providing goods or services, they relied on the existence of the domestic partnership and the agreement of both partners to be jointly responsible for those specific expenses. SEC. 4. Section 298 of the Family Code is amended to read: 298. (a) The Secretary of State shall prepare forms entitled ``Declaration of Domestic Partnership'' and ``Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership'' to meet the requirements of this division. These forms shall require the signature and seal of an acknowledgment by a notary public to be binding and valid. (b) (1) The Secretary of State shall distribute these forms to each county clerk.

Section 298.5 of the Family Code is amended to read: 298.5. (a) Two persons desiring to become domestic partners may complete and file a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State. 99   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  -- 10 --  (b) The Secretary of State shall register the Declaration of Domestic Partnership in a registry for those partnerships, and shall return a copy of the registered form to the domestic partners at the mailing address provided by the domestic partners as their common residence. (c) No person who has filed a Declaration of Domestic Partnership may file a new Declaration of Domestic Partnership until at least six months after the date that a Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership was filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 299 in connection with the termination or enter a civil marriage with someone other than their registered domestic partner unless the most recent domestic partnership has been terminated or a final judgment of dissolution or nullity of the most recent domestic partnership has been entered. This prohibition does not apply if the previous domestic partnership ended because one of the partners died or married. SEC. 6. Section 299 of the Family Code is repealed. 299. (a) A domestic partnership is terminated when any one of the following occurs: (1) One partner gives or sends to the other partner a written notice by certified mail that he or she is terminating the partnership. (2) One of the domestic partners dies. (3) One of the domestic partners marries. (4) The domestic partners no longer have a common residence. (b) Upon termination of a domestic partnership, at least one former partner shall file a Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State by mailing a completed form to the Secretary of State by certified mail. The date on which the Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership is received by the Secretary of State shall be deemed the actual termination date of the domestic partnership, unless termination is caused by the death or marriage of a domestic partner, in which case the actual termination date shall be the date indicated on the Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership form. The partner who files the Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership shall send a copy of the notice to the last known address of the other partner. (c) A former domestic partner who has given a copy of a Declaration of Domestic Partnership to any third party in order to qualify for any benefit or right shall, within 60 days of termination 99   -- 11 -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  AB 205  of the domestic partnership, give or send to the third party, at the last known address of the third party, written notification that the domestic partnership has been terminated. A third party who suffers a loss as a result of failure by the domestic partner to send this notice shall be entitled to seek recovery from the partner who was obligated to send it for any actual loss resulting thereby. (d) Failure to provide the third-party notice required in subdivision (c) shall not delay or prevent the termination of the domestic partnership. SEC. 7.

(c) The termination of a domestic partnership pursuant to this section does not prejudice nor bar the rights of either of the parties to institute an action to set aside the termination for fraud, duress, mistake, or any other ground recognized at law or in equity.

(a) Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether they derive from statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, common law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are granted to and imposed upon spouses in a civil marriage.

(e) To the extent that provisions of California law adopt, refer to, or rely upon, provisions of federal law in a way that otherwise would cause registered domestic partners to be treated differently than spouses in a civil marriage, registered domestic partners shall be treated by California law as if federal law recognized a domestic partnership in the same manner as California law. (f) No public agency in this state may discriminate against any person or couple on the ground that the person or couple is in a registered domestic partnership rather than in a civil marriage.

(b) A legal union of two persons that was validly formed in another jurisdiction, and that is substantially equivalent to a domestic partnership as defined in this part, shall be recognized as a valid domestic partnership in this state regardless of whether it bears the name domestic partnership. SEC. 10. Section 299.3 is added to the Family Code, to read: 299.3.

Effective January 1, 2005, California's law related to the rights and responsibilities of registered domestic partners will change (or, if you are receiving this letter after that date, the law has changed, as of January 1, 2005). With this new legislation, for purposes of California law, domestic partners will have a great many new rights and responsibilities, including laws governing 99   -- 15 -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  AB 205  community property and taxation, those governing property transfer, those regarding duties of mutual financial support and mutual responsibilities for certain debts to third parties, and many others. The way domestic partnerships are terminated is also changing. After January 1, 2005, under certain circumstances, it will be necessary to participate in a dissolution proceeding in court to end a domestic partnership. Domestic partners who do not wish to be subject to these new rights and responsibilities MUST terminate their domestic partnership before January 1, 2005. Under the law in effect until January 1, 2005, your domestic partnership is automatically terminated if you or your partner marry or die while you are registered as domestic partners. It is also terminated if you send to your partner or your partner sends to you, by certified mail, a notice terminating the domestic partnership, or if you and your partner no longer share a common residence. In all cases, you are required to file a Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership. If you do not terminate your domestic partnership before January 1, 2005, as provided above, you will be subject to these new rights and responsibilities and, under certain circumstances, you will only be able to terminate your domestic partnership, other than as a result of domestic partner's death, by the filing of a court action. If you have any questions about any of these changes, please consult an attorney. If you cannot find an attorney in your locale, please contact your county bar association for a referral. Sincerely, The Secretary of State'' (b) From January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2004, inclusive, the Secretary of State shall provide the following notice with all requests for the Declaration of Domestic Partnership form. The Secretary of State also shall attach the Notice to the Declaration of Domestic Partnership form that is provided to the general public on the Secretary of State's Web site:  99   AB 205 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  -- 16 -- ``NOTICE TO POTENTIAL DOMESTIC PARTNER REGISTRANTS  As of January 1, 2005, California's law of domestic partnership will change.

The way domestic partnerships are terminated will also change. Unlike current law, which allows partners to end their partnership simply by filing a ``Termination of Domestic Partnership'' form with the Secretary of State, after January 1, 2005, it will be necessary under certain circumstances to participate in a dissolution proceeding in court to end a domestic partnership.

The updated text of  WAC 458-16A-010  contains information about the exemption and about how the size of the exemption will be determined.  The revised text of  WAC 458-16A-020  explains how applications submitted will be handled when the home for aging is completed or begins operating after the January 1st assessment date and the manner in which the size of the property tax exemption will be determined when a home receives more than one government housing subsidy.  This rule is also being revised to delete an application processing deadline that has no statutory basis.

(1)  Introduction.  Under  RCW 84.36.041 , a nonprofit home for the aging may be totally or partially exempt from property tax.  This section explains the exemptions allowed and the criteria that must be met in order to receive an exemption under this statute.  Throughout this section, all requirements will pertain to all types of homes for the aging including, but not limited to, adult care homes, assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities (CCRC), and independent housing, unless a particular type of home is separately identified. (2)  Definitions.   For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: (a) ""Acquisition"" means that an existing home for the aging (or home) currently in operation is acquired by a nonprofit organization and the ownership of the facility will change as a result of a purchase, gift, foreclosure, or other method. (b) ""Assistance with activities of daily living"" means the home provides, brokers, or contracts for the provision of auxiliary services to residents, such as meal and housekeeping service, transportation, ambulatory service, and attendant care including, but not limited to, bathing and other acts related to personal hygiene, dressing, shopping, food preparation, monitoring of medication, and laundry services. (c) ""Combined disposable income"" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of (( his or her ))  the person's  spouse, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or (( his or her ))  the person's  spouse or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. (i) If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding calendar year, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person during the months the person was retired by twelve. (ii) If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding calendar year because of the death of the person's spouse, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person after the death of the spouse by twelve. (d) ""Complete and separate dwelling units"" means that the individual units of a home contain complete facilities for living, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation. (e) ""Construction"" means the actual construction or building of all or a portion of a home that did not exist prior to the construction. (f) ""Continuing care retirement community"" or ""CCRC"" means an entity that provides shelter and services under continuing care contracts with its residents or includes a health care facility or health service. (g) ""Continuing care contract"" means a contract to provide a person, for the duration of that person's life or for a term in excess of one year, shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services, that is conditioned upon the transfer of property, the payment of an entrance fee to the provider of the services, and/or the payment of periodic charges in consideration for the care and services provided.  A continuing care contract is not excluded from this definition because the contract is mutually terminable or because shelter and services are not provided at the same location. (h) ""Cotenant"" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident. (i) ""Disposable income"" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended prior to January 1, 1994, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income: (i) Capital gains, other than (( nonrecognized gain on the sale of a principal residence under section 1034 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, or )) gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal Internal Revenue Code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence; (ii) Amounts deducted for loss; (iii) Amounts deducted for depreciation; (iv) Pension and annuity receipts; (v) Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vi) Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vii) Federal Social Security Act and railroad retirement benefits; (viii) Dividend receipts; and (ix) Interest received on state and municipal bonds. (j) ""Eligible resident"" means a person who: (i) Occupied the dwelling unit as (( a ))  their  principal place of residence as of  December 31st of the assessment year the home first became operational or in each subsequent year, occupied the dwelling unit as their principal place of residence as of  January 1st of the  assessment  year (( in which the claim for exemption is filed.  The exemption will not be nullified if the )) .  If an  eligible resident is confined to a hospital or nursing home and the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or occupied by a spouse, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both , the dwelling will still be considered occupied by the eligible resident ; (ii) Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of physical disability.  A surviving spouse of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify for this exemption if the surviving spouse is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and (iii) Has a combined disposable income that is no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as determined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the county in which the person resides and in effect as of January 1 of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (k)  ""First assessment year the home becomes operational"" or ""the assessment year the home first became operational"" means the first year the home becomes occupied by and provides services to eligible residents.  Depending upon the facts, this year will be the year during which construction of the home is completed or the year during which a nonprofit organization purchases or acquires an existing home and begins to operate it as a nonprofit home for the aging. (l)  ""Home for the aging"" or ""home"" means a residential housing facility that: (i) Provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) Has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) Provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. (( (l) ))  (m)  ""HUD"" means the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. (( (m) ))  (n)  ""Local median income"" means the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect on January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (( (n) ))  (o)  ""Low income"" means that the combined disposable income of a resident is eighty percent or less of the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect as of January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (( (o) ))  (p)  ""Occupied dwelling unit"" means a living unit that is occupied  either  on January 1st of the year (( in ))  for  which the (( claim ))  application  for exemption is (( filed ))  made or on December 31st of the assessment year the home first becomes operational and for which application for exemption is made . (( (p) ))  (q)  ""Property that is reasonably necessary"" means all property that is: (i) Operated and used by a home; and (ii) The use of which is restricted to residents, guests, or employees of a home. (( (q) ))  (r)  ""Refinancing"" means the discharge of an existing debt with funds obtained through the creation of new debt.  For purposes of this section, even if the application for tax exempt bond financing to refinance existing debt is treated by the financing agent as something other than refinancing, an application for a property tax exemption because of refinancing by tax exempt bonds will be treated as refinancing and the set-asides specific to refinancing will be applied.  ""Refinancing"" shall include tax exempt bond financing in excess of the amount of existing debt that is obtained to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge a facility currently being operated as a home. (( (r) ))  (s)  ""Rehabilitation"" means that an existing building or structure, not currently used as a home, will be modified, improved, restored, extended, or enlarged so that it (( will ))  can  be used as a home for elderly and disabled individuals.  A project will be considered a rehabilitation if the costs of rehabilitation exceed five thousand dollars.  If a home has acquired tax exempt bond financing and does not meet the definition of ""rehabilitation"" contained in this subsection, the home may be eligible for a total exemption under the ""refinancing"" definition and if it meets the ""refinancing"" set-aside requirements.  If such a home is not eligible for a total exemption, the department will determine the home's eligibility for a partial exemption in accordance with the pertinent parts of  RCW 84.36.041  and this section. (( (s) ))  (t)  ""Set-aside(s)"" means the percentage of dwelling units reserved for low-income residents when the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a financing program using tax exempt bonds. (( (t) ))  (u)  ""Shared dwelling units"" or ""shared units"" means individual dwelling units of a home that do not contain complete facilities for living, eating, cooking, and sanitation. (( (u) ))  (v)  ""Taxable value"" means the value of the home upon which the tax rate is applied in order to determine the amount of property taxes due. (( (v) ))  (w)  ""Total amount financed"" means the total amount of financing required by the home to fund construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, or refinancing.  Seventy-five percent of this amount must be supplied by tax exempt bonds to receive the total exemption from property tax available under the tax exempt bond financing provision of  RCW 84.36.041 . (3)  General requirements.   To be exempt under this section, a home for the aging must be: (a) Exclusively used for the purposes for which exemption is granted, except as provided in  RCW 84.36.805 ; (b) Operated by an organization that is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code; and (c) The benefit of the exemption must inure to the home. (4)  Total exemption.   There are three ways in which a home may be totally exempt from property tax.  All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt if it meets the general requirements listed in subsection (3) of this section and: (a) At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents; (b) The home is subsidized under a HUD program; or (c) The construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents.  See subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this section for tax exempt bond requirements and the percentage of units that must be set-aside for low-income residents in order for the home to be totally exempt. (5)  Homes or CCRCs financed by tax exempt bonds--Generally.   All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home or CCRC may be totally exempt from property tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed for construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home or CCRC to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents. (a) The percentage of set-aside units required will vary depending on whether the home is a CCRC, the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained, the type of dwelling unit, and the receipt of Medicaid funds.  The set-aside requirements for homes are set forth in subsection (6) of this section and for CCRCs are set forth in subsection (7) of this section. (b) The exemption will be granted in direct correlation (( between ))  to  the total amount financed by tax exempt bonds and the portion of the home or CCRC that is constructed, acquired, rehabilitated, or refinanced by tax exempt bonds. (c) If tax exempt bonds are used for refinancing, the set-aside requirements set forth in subsections (6) and (7) of this section will be applied to the actual area or portion of the home or CCRC to which the bonds correspond. (i) Example 1.  A CCRC (that accepts Medicaid funds) is composed of a multistory building, six duplexes, and two independent homes and the CCRC has secured tax exempt bonds to satisfy an existing mortgage on the multistory building.  Only the multistory building will be considered eligible for a total exemption from property tax because of tax exempt bond financing. To receive the exemption, at least twenty percent of the dwelling units of the multistory building must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income or at least forty percent of the dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. (ii) Example 2.  A home obtains tax exempt bonds to refinance a portion of the home and to fund construction.  The department will separately consider the area of the home that corresponds to the purpose for which the tax exempt bonds were obtained.  The set-aside requirements related to refinancing will be applied to the portion of the home that corresponds to the mortgage being refinanced and the set-aside requirements related to construction will be applied to the area of the home to be newly constructed.  The department will determine the eligibility for partial exemption of the remainder of the home that is not being refinanced or constructed. (d) If a total exemption is granted under the tax exempt bond financing provision, the total exemption will remain in effect as long as: (i) The home or CCRC remains in compliance with the requirements under which it received the tax exempt bonds; (ii) The tax exempt bonds are outstanding; and (iii) The set-aside requirements are met. (e) If a home or CCRC has obtained tax exempt bond financing to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge its existing facility and the project does not meet the definition of rehabilitation contained in subsection (2) of this section, the project will not be considered a rehabilitation (( and )) .  In this situation,  the set-aside requirements related to refinancing or acquisition will be applied in determining eligibility for a total exemption. (f) When a home or CCRC no longer meets the criteria for exemption under the tax exempt bond financing portion of the statute, eligibility for exemption under  RCW 84.34.041  will be determined by the other provisions of the statute.  In other words, a home may receive a total or partial exemption depending on the number of residents who are deemed to be ""eligible residents"" or who require ""assistance with activities of daily living."" For example, if a home that previously received a total exemption due to the receipt of tax exempt bond financing has one hundred dwelling units and sixty of those dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive a total exemption. (6)  Set-aside requirements related to homes and tax exempt bond financing.   A specified number of dwelling units within a home must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for homes will be determined according to the type of dwelling units contained in the home and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to CCRCs.  The specific set-aside requirements for CCRCs are described in subsection (7) of this section.  A home must meet the following set-aside requirements to be totally exempt from property tax:   PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING   TYPE OF DWELLING UNIT   SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS     New construction  or  Rehabilitation   Complete  Separate units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   Complete  Separate units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside  for residents at or below 50% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   Complete  Separate units   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for  residents at or below 60% of local median income     Acquisition, New Construction, Refinancing,  or  Rehabilitation   Shared units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income        (7)  Set-aside requirements related to CCRCs and tax exempt bond financing.   A specified number of dwelling units of a CCRC must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for CCRCs will be determined by whether the CCRC does or does not have Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to other homes.  The specific set-aside requirements for other homes are described in subsection (6) of this section. (a) The continuing care contract between the resident and the CCRC is a contract to provide shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services to the resident for the duration of the resident's life or for a term in excess of one year.  A resident's tenancy may not be terminated due to inability of the resident to fully pay the monthly service fee when the resident establishes facts to justify a waiver or reduction of these charges.  This provision shall not apply if the resident, without the CCRC's consent, has impaired his and/or her ability to meet financial obligations required by the continuing care contract due to a transfer of assets, after signing the continuing care contract, other than to meet ordinary and customary living expenses, or by incurring unusual or unnecessary new financial obligations. (b) A CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents may not receive Medicaid funds from Washington state or the federal government during the term that the bonds are outstanding, except during the initial transition period as allowed by state law or if the regulatory agreement with the tax exempt bond financier exempts the CCRC from compliance with this requirement. (c) The following set-aside requirements must be met by CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) to receive a total exemption:   PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING   SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS     New construction  or  Rehabilitation   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income       (d) The following set-aside requirements must be met by CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds to receive a total exemption:   PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING   SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS     New construction  or  Rehabilitation   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income       (8)  Partial exemption.   If a home does not qualify for a total exemption from property tax, the home may receive a partial exemption for its real property on a unit by unit basis and a total exemption for its personal property. (a) Real property exemption.  If the real property of a home is used in the following ways, the portion of the real property so used will be exempt and the home may receive a partial exemption for: (i) Each dwelling unit occupied by a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living; (ii) Each dwelling unit occupied by an eligible resident; and  (iii) Common or shared areas of the home that are jointly used for two or more purposes that are exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW . (b) Assistance with activities of daily living.  A home may receive a partial exemption for each dwelling unit that is occupied by a resident who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and the home provides, brokers, facilitates, or contracts for the provision of this assistance.  A resident requiring assistance with the activities of daily living must be a resident who requires significant assistance with at least three of the nonexclusive list of activities set forth below and who, unless (( he or she ))  the resident  receives the assistance, would be at risk of being placed in a nursing home.  Activities of daily living include, but are not limited to: (i) Shopping; (ii) Meal and/or food preparation; (iii) Housekeeping; (iv) Transportation; (v) Dressing; (vi) Bathing; (vii) General personal hygiene; (viii) Monitoring of medication;  (ix) Ambulatory services; (x) Laundry services; (xi) Incontinence management; and (xii) Cuing for the cognitively impaired. (c) Examples of assistance with the activities of daily living: (i) If the resident of a home requires (( someone to assist him or her ))  assistance  with daily dressing, bathing, and personal hygiene, weekly housekeeping chores, and daily meal preparation, (( he or she ))  the person  is a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living and the home may receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit in which (( he or she ))  the person  resides. (ii) If the resident of a CCRC only requires someone to clean (( his or her ))  the  house weekly and to do the laundry weekly, the resident does not require significant assistance with activities of daily living and the CCRC may not receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit. (d) Common or shared areas.  Areas of a home that are jointly used for two or more purposes exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW  will be exempted under  RCW 84.36.041 . (i) The joint use of the common or shared areas must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  A kitchen, dining room, and laundry room are examples of the types of common or shared areas for which a partial property tax exemption may be granted.  (ii) Example.  A nonprofit organization uses its facility as a home for the aging and a nursing home.  The home and nursing home jointly use the kitchen and dining room.  The home may receive a property tax exemption for the common or shared areas under  RCW 84.36.041 .  The eligibility of the other areas of the facility will be determined by the appropriate statute.  The home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.040 . (e) Amount of partial exemption.  The amount of partial exemption will be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, minus/less the assessed value of any common or shared areas, by a fraction.   The numerator and denominator of the fraction will vary depending on the first assessment year the home became operational and occupied by eligible residents. (i) Numerator.  If the home becomes operational after the January 1st assessment date, the numerator is the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living on December 31st.  The December 31st date will be used only in the first year of operation.  In any other assessment year, t he numerator (( of the fraction )) is the number of the dwelling units occupied on January 1st of the assessment year by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living. (ii) Denominator.  If the home becomes operational after the January 1st assessment date, the denominator is the number of dwelling units occupied on December 31st.  The December 31st date will be used only in the first assessment year the home becomes operational.  In any other assessment year, t he denominator (( of the fraction )) is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of January 1st of the assessment year. (iii)  Example:     Assessed value of home:   $500,000       Less assessed value of common area:     - 80,000       Total   $420,000         Number of units occupied on 1/1 by  eligible residents and people requiring assistance with daily living activities  Total of occupied units on 1/1     =    6 40 or.15         $420,000 x .15 = $63,000 Amount of partial exemption       $420,000 - $63,000 = $357,000 Taxable value of home       (f) Valuation of the home.  The assessor will value a home that receives a partial exemption by considering only the current use of the property during the period in which the partial exemption is received and will not consider any potential use of the property. (9)  Income verification required from some residents.   If a home seeks a total property tax exemption because at least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents or seeks to receive a partial exemption based upon the number of units occupied by eligible residents, the residents must submit income verification forms.  The department may request income verification forms from residents of homes receiving a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing. (a) The income verification forms must be submitted to the assessor of the county in which the home is located by July 1st of the assessment year in which the application for exemption is made.   If the home becomes operational after the January 1st assessment date, these forms must be submitted to the assessor as soon as they are available but no later than December 31st of that assessment year. (b) The income verification form will be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. (c) If an eligible resident filed an income verification form for a previous year, (( he or she ))  the resident  is not required to submit a new form unless there is a change in status affecting the resident's eligibility, such as a significant increase or decrease in disposable income, or the assessor or the department requests a new income verification form to be submitted. (10)  Additional requirements.   Any nonprofit home for the aging that applies for a property tax exemption under this section must also comply with the provisions of  WAC 458-16A-020  and 458-16-165.   WAC 458-16A-020  contains information regarding the initial application and renewal procedures relating to the exemption discussed in this section.   WAC 458-16-165  sets forth additional requirements that must be complied with to obtain a property tax exemption pursuant to  RCW 84.36.041 .   [Statutory Authority:   RCW 84.36.041  and  84.36.865 .   99-04-016 ,  458-16A-010, filed 1/22/99, effective 2/22/99.  Statutory Authority:   RCW 84.08.010 ,  84.08.070  and  84.36.041 .  95-06-041,  458-16A-010, filed 2/24/95, effective 3/27/95.]   OTS-3715.2 AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 95-06-042, filed 2/24/95, effective 3/27/95) WAC 458-16A-020   Nonprofit homes for the aging -- Initial application and annual renewal.   (1)  Introduction.   This section explains the initial application process that must be followed (( for ))  when  a home for the aging wishes to obtain a property tax exemption under  RCW 84.36.041 .  This section also describes the annual renewal requirements that a home must follow to retain its  tax  exempt status, as well as the role of the assessor's office and the department of revenue in administering this exemption.  Throughout this section, all requirements will pertain to all types of homes for the aging including, but not limited to, adult care homes, assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities (CCRC), and independent housing. (2)  Definitions.   For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: (a) ""Assessor"" means the county assessor or any agency or person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the assessor. (b) ""Combined disposable income"" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of (( his or her ))  the persons's  spouse, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or (( his or her ))  the person's  spouse or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. (i) If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding calendar year, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person during the months the person was retired by twelve. (ii) If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding calendar year by reason of the death of the person's spouse, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person after the death of the spouse by twelve. (c) ""Continuing care retirement community"" or ""CCRC"" means an entity that provides shelter and services under continuing care contracts with its residents or includes a health care facility or health service. (d) ""Continuing care contract"" means a contract to provide a person, for the duration of that person's life or for a term in excess of one year, shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services, that is conditioned upon the transfer of property, the payment of an entrance fee to the provider of the services, and/or the payment of periodic charges in consideration for the care and services provided. A continuing care contract is not excluded from this definition because the contract is mutually terminable or because shelter and services are not provided at the same location. (e) ""Cotenant"" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident. (f) ""Department"" means the department of revenue. (g) ""Eligible resident"" means a person who: (i) Occupied the dwelling unit as (( his or her ))  their  principal place of residence as of  December 31st of the assessment year the home first became operational or in each subsequent year, occupied the dwelling unit as their principal place of residence as of  January 1st of the  assessment  year (( in which the claim for exemption is filed.  The exemption will continue if the )) .  If an  eligible resident is confined to a hospital or nursing home and the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or occupied by a spouse, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both , the dwelling will still be considered occupied by the eligible resident ; (ii) Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of physical disability.  A surviving spouse of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify for this exemption if the surviving spouse is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and (iii) Has a combined disposable income that is no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as determined by federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the county in which the person resides. (h)  ""First assessment year the home becomes operational"" or ""the assessment year the home first became operational"" means the first year the home becomes occupied by and provides services to eligible residents.  Depending upon the facts, this year will be the year during which construction of the home is completed or the year during which a nonprofit organization purchases or acquires an existing home and begins to operate it as a nonprofit home for the aging. (i)  ""Homes for the aging"" or ""home(s)"" means a residential housing facility that: (i) Provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) Has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) Provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. (( (i) ))  (j)  ""HUD"" means the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.  (( (j) ))  (k)  ""Occupied dwelling unit"" means a living unit that is occupied  either  on January 1st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed  or on December 31st of the first assessment year the home becomes operational and in which the claim for exemption is filed . (( (k) ))  (l)  ""Property that is reasonably necessary"" means all property that is: (i) Operated and used by a home; and (ii) The use of which is restricted to residents, guests, or employees of a home. (3)  Application for exemption.   The tax exemption authorized by  RCW 84.36.041  is claimed by and benefits a nonprofit home for the aging, not the residents of (( a ))  the  home.  Therefore, the claim for this exemption is submitted by a home to the department. (a) If a claim for exemption is filed on behalf of a home under  RCW 84.36.041  and the exemption is granted, no resident of that home may receive a personal exemption under  RCW 84.36.381 . (b) A listing of the varying levels of care and supervision provided or coordinated by the home must accompany all initial applications submitted for exemption.  Examples of the varying levels of care and supervision include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) Conducting routine room checks; (ii) Arranging for or providing transportation; (iii) Arranging for or providing meals; (iv) On site medical personnel; (v) Monitoring of medication; or (vi) Housekeeping services. (c) Homes having real property that is used for purposes other than as a home (for example, property used for a barber shop) must provide the department with a floor plan identifying the square footage devoted to each exempt and nonexempt use. (d) At the time an application for exemption is submitted, the home must submit proof that it is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c) organization. (e) Homes that apply for a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing must submit a copy of the regulatory agreement between the home and the entity that issues the bonds.  When only a portion of the home is financed by a program using tax exempt bonds, the home must submit a site plan of the home indicating the areas so financed. (4)  Segregation.   A nonprofit organization that provides shelter and services to elderly and disabled individuals may use the facility for more than one purpose that is exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  Property that is used for more than one exempt purpose and that qualifies for exemption under a statute other than  RCW 84.36.041  will be segregated and exempted pursuant to the applicable statute. (a) If a home includes a nursing home, the department will segregate the home and the part of the facility that is used as a nursing home.  The department will separately determine the eligibility of the home under  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home under  RCW 84.36.040  for the property tax exemption available under each statute.     Exception:   If the home does not receive Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) and is seeking a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing, the home and nursing home will be considered as a whole when the set-aside requirements are applied.        (b) Dwelling units that are occupied by residents who do not meet the age or disability requirements of  RCW 84.36.041  will be segregated and taxed. (c) Common or shared areas.  Areas of a home that are jointly used for two or more purposes exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW  will be exempted under  RCW 84.36.041 . (i) The joint use of the common or shared areas must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  A kitchen, dining room, and laundry room are examples of the types of common or shared areas for which a property tax exemption may be granted. (ii) Example.  A nonprofit organization uses its facility as a home for the aging and a nursing home.  The home and nursing home jointly use the kitchen and dining room.  The home may receive a property tax exemption for the common or shared areas under  RCW 84.36.041 .  The eligibility of the other areas of the facility will be determined by the appropriate statute.  The home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.040 . (5)  Homes subsidized by HUD.   Homes subsidized by a HUD program must initially and each March 31st thereafter provide the department with a letter of certification from HUD of continued HUD subsidy and a list of the name, age, and/or disability of all residents.   If the property is subsidized by more than one HUD contract and one of the contracts expires or is otherwise no longer in effect, the eligibility of the portion of the facility still subsidized by HUD will be conditioned on receipt of a letter of certification from HUD and a listing of all persons residing on the property.  The eligibility of the remainder of the property will be determined by the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents on January 1st following the expiration or cancellation of the HUD subsidy. (6)  Homes that are not subsidized by HUD.   If a home is not subsidized by HUD or does not meet the requirements to receive a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing, it may receive a total or partial exemption from property tax.  The extent of the exemption will be determined by the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents.  If more than fifty percent of the dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive a total exemption.  Alternatively, if less than fifty percent of the dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive partial exemption for its real property on a unit by unit basis and a total exemption for its personal property. An income verification form(( , Form REV 64-0043, )) will be used to determine if a resident of a home meets the criteria of ""eligible resident.""   During the initial application process, the residents of a home applying for exemption will be asked to submit an income verification form with the assessor of the county in which the home is located and the assessor and/or the department may request any relevant information deemed necessary to make a determination. (a) (( Between January 1st and July 1st of the year preceding the year in which the tax is due, residents must file Form REV 64-0043 with the assessor of the county in which the home is located. ))  The type of income verification form required and its due date depends upon the date the home first became operational and began to provide services to eligible residents: (i) If the home was operating and providing services to eligible residents on the January 1st assessment date, the residents are to submit Form REV 64-0043 between January 1st and July 1st of the year preceding the year in which the tax is due; or (ii) If the home started operating and providing services to eligible residents after the January 1st assessment date, the residents are to submit Form REV 64-0042 on or before December 31st of the year preceding the year in which the tax is due.  In this situation, no income verification forms will be required during the following year if the same eligible residents occupy the same dwelling units on December 31st and January 1st of the subsequent year. (b) If two or more residents occupy one unit, only one cotenant is required to file verification of combined disposable income, as defined in subsection (2) of this section, with the assessor.  (c) Form REV 64-0043 will not be accepted by the assessor if it is submitted or postmarked after July 1st  unless the assessor and/or the department has agreed to waive this deadline.  Form REV 64-0042 will not be accepted if it is submitted or postmarked after December 31st unless the assessor and/or department agrees to waive this deadline .  (d)  After the application for exemption is approved, residents will not be required to file a new income verification form unless a change in their circumstances occurs or the assessor requests it.  However, a t any time after the initial application (( for exemption )) is approved, assessors and/or the department may: (i) Request residents to complete Form REV 64-0043(( , the verification of income form )); (ii) Conduct audits; and (iii) Request other relevant information to ensure continued eligibility.  (e) (( If ))  By March 31st each year,  a home not subsidized by HUD  that  wishes to retain its exempt property tax status(( , the home )) must (( by March 31st of each year )) file with the department a list of the total number of dwelling units in (( their ))  its  complex, the number of occupied dwelling units in (( their ))  its  complex as of January 1st, the number of previously qualified dwelling units in (( their ))  its  complex that are no longer occupied by the same eligible residents, and a list of the name, age, and/or disability of all residents and the date upon which they moved into or occupied the home.   If a home's eligibility was based upon the number of units occupied on December 31st, the home must only provide the department with an amended list of additions or deletions as of the subsequent January 1st assessment date. (7)  Homes financed by tax exempt bonds.   Homes that receive a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing must initially and each March 31st thereafter provide the department with a letter of certification from the agency or organization monitoring compliance with the bond requirements.  The letter of certification must verify that the home is in full compliance with all requirements and set-asides of the underlying regulatory agreement. (a) If the set-aside requirements contained in the regulatory agreement differ from the set-aside requirements established by the department and set forth in  WAC 458-16A-010 , the department may require the residents of the home to submit income verification forms (Form REV  64-0042 or  64-0043) to the assessor of the county in which the home is located. (b) (( The ))  A  home  for the aging that is receiving a property tax exemption  must (( also )) annually submit a list of the name, age, and/or disability of all residents  in the home  to the department. (8)  Assessor's responsibilities.   Assessors will determine the age or disability and income eligibility of all residents who file Form REV  64-0042 or  64-0043, the income verification form s .  By July 15th each year  or by January 15th of the assessment year following the first assessment year a home becomes operational , the assessor will forward a copy of Form REV  64-0042 or  64-0043 to the department for each resident who meets the eligibility requirements. (9) (( Department of revenue responsibilities.   The department will make its determination by August 31st, or within thirty days of the date all required information is submitted to the department, of the exempt status of a home that applies for this exemption. (10) ))  Appeals.   An applicant who is determined not to be an ""eligible resident"" by the assessor and a home that is denied a property tax exemption by the department each have the right to appeal.  Appeals must be filed within thirty days of the date the notice of ineligibility or denial was mailed by the assessor or the department. (a) If the assessor determines that an applicant does not meet the (( criteria to be ))  definition of  an ""eligible resident"" (( of a home )), the resident may appeal this decision to the board of equalization of the county in which the home is located. (b) If the department denies, in whole or in part, an application for exemption, the home may appeal this denial to the state board of tax appeals. (( (11) ))  (10)   Additional requirements.   Any nonprofit home for the aging that applies for a property tax exemption under this section must also comply with the provisions of  WAC 458-16A-010  and 458-16-165.

(1)  Introduction.  Under  RCW 84.36.041 , a nonprofit home for the aging may be totally or partially exempt from property tax.  This section explains the exemptions allowed and the criteria that must be met in order to receive an exemption under this statute.  Throughout this section, all requirements will pertain to all types of homes for the aging including, but not limited to, adult care homes, assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities (CCRC), and independent housing, unless a particular type of home is separately identified. (2)  Definitions.   For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: (a) ""Acquisition"" means that an existing home for the aging (or home) currently in operation is acquired by a nonprofit organization and the ownership of the facility will change as a result of a purchase, gift, foreclosure, or other method. (b) ""Assistance with activities of daily living"" means the home provides, brokers, or contracts for the provision of auxiliary services to residents, such as meal and housekeeping service, transportation, ambulatory service, and attendant care including, but not limited to, bathing and other acts related to personal hygiene, dressing, shopping, food preparation, monitoring of medication, and laundry services. (c) ""Combined disposable income"" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of (( his or her ))  the person's  spouse, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or (( his or her ))  the person's  spouse or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. (i) If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding calendar year, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person during the months the person was retired by twelve. (ii) If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding calendar year because of the death of the person's spouse, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person after the death of the spouse by twelve. (d) ""Complete and separate dwelling units"" means that the individual units of a home contain complete facilities for living, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation. (e) ""Construction"" means the actual construction or building of all or a portion of a home that did not exist prior to the construction. (f) ""Continuing care retirement community"" or ""CCRC"" means an entity that provides shelter and services under continuing care contracts with its residents or includes a health care facility or health service. (g) ""Continuing care contract"" means a contract to provide a person, for the duration of that person's life or for a term in excess of one year, shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services, that is conditioned upon the transfer of property, the payment of an entrance fee to the provider of the services, and/or the payment of periodic charges in consideration for the care and services provided.  A continuing care contract is not excluded from this definition because the contract is mutually terminable or because shelter and services are not provided at the same location. (h) ""Cotenant"" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident. (i) ""Disposable income"" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended prior to January 1, 1994, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income: (i) Capital gains, other than (( nonrecognized gain on the sale of a principal residence under section 1034 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, or )) gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal Internal Revenue Code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence; (ii) Amounts deducted for loss; (iii) Amounts deducted for depreciation; (iv) Pension and annuity receipts; (v) Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vi) Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vii) Federal Social Security Act and railroad retirement benefits; (viii) Dividend receipts; and (ix) Interest received on state and municipal bonds. (j) ""Eligible resident"" means a person who: (i) Occupied the dwelling unit as (( a ))  their  principal place of residence as of  December 31st of the assessment year the home first became operational or in each subsequent year, occupied the dwelling unit as their principal place of residence as of  January 1st of the  assessment  year (( in which the claim for exemption is filed.  The exemption will not be nullified if the )) .  If an  eligible resident is confined to a hospital or nursing home and the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or occupied by a spouse, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both , the dwelling will still be considered occupied by the eligible resident ; (ii) Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of physical disability.  A surviving spouse of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify for this exemption if the surviving spouse is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and (iii) Has a combined disposable income that is no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as determined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the county in which the person resides and in effect as of January 1 of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (k)  ""First assessment year the home becomes operational"" or ""the assessment year the home first became operational"" means the first year the home becomes occupied by and provides services to eligible residents.  Depending upon the facts, this year will be the year during which construction of the home is completed or the year during which a nonprofit organization purchases or acquires an existing home and begins to operate it as a nonprofit home for the aging. (l)  ""Home for the aging"" or ""home"" means a residential housing facility that: (i) Provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) Has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) Provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. (( (l) ))  (m)  ""HUD"" means the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. (( (m) ))  (n)  ""Local median income"" means the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect on January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (( (n) ))  (o)  ""Low income"" means that the combined disposable income of a resident is eighty percent or less of the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect as of January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (( (o) ))  (p)  ""Occupied dwelling unit"" means a living unit that is occupied  either  on January 1st of the year (( in ))  for  which the (( claim ))  application  for exemption is (( filed ))  made or on December 31st of the assessment year the home first becomes operational and for which application for exemption is made . (( (p) ))  (q)  ""Property that is reasonably necessary"" means all property that is: (i) Operated and used by a home; and (ii) The use of which is restricted to residents, guests, or employees of a home. (( (q) ))  (r)  ""Refinancing"" means the discharge of an existing debt with funds obtained through the creation of new debt.  For purposes of this section, even if the application for tax exempt bond financing to refinance existing debt is treated by the financing agent as something other than refinancing, an application for a property tax exemption because of refinancing by tax exempt bonds will be treated as refinancing and the set-asides specific to refinancing will be applied.  ""Refinancing"" shall include tax exempt bond financing in excess of the amount of existing debt that is obtained to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge a facility currently being operated as a home. (( (r) ))  (s)  ""Rehabilitation"" means that an existing building or structure, not currently used as a home, will be modified, improved, restored, extended, or enlarged so that it (( will ))  can  be used as a home for elderly and disabled individuals.  A project will be considered a rehabilitation if the costs of rehabilitation exceed five thousand dollars.  If a home has acquired tax exempt bond financing and does not meet the definition of ""rehabilitation"" contained in this subsection, the home may be eligible for a total exemption under the ""refinancing"" definition and if it meets the ""refinancing"" set-aside requirements.  If such a home is not eligible for a total exemption, the department will determine the home's eligibility for a partial exemption in accordance with the pertinent parts of  RCW 84.36.041  and this section. (( (s) ))  (t)  ""Set-aside(s)"" means the percentage of dwelling units reserved for low-income residents when the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a financing program using tax exempt bonds. (( (t) ))  (u)  ""Shared dwelling units"" or ""shared units"" means individual dwelling units of a home that do not contain complete facilities for living, eating, cooking, and sanitation. (( (u) ))  (v)  ""Taxable value"" means the value of the home upon which the tax rate is applied in order to determine the amount of property taxes due. (( (v) ))  (w)  ""Total amount financed"" means the total amount of financing required by the home to fund construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, or refinancing.  Seventy-five percent of this amount must be supplied by tax exempt bonds to receive the total exemption from property tax available under the tax exempt bond financing provision of  RCW 84.36.041 . (3)  General requirements.   To be exempt under this section, a home for the aging must be: (a) Exclusively used for the purposes for which exemption is granted, except as provided in  RCW 84.36.805 ; (b) Operated by an organization that is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code; and (c) The benefit of the exemption must inure to the home. (4)  Total exemption.   There are three ways in which a home may be totally exempt from property tax.  All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt if it meets the general requirements listed in subsection (3) of this section and: (a) At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents; (b) The home is subsidized under a HUD program; or (c) The construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents.  See subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this section for tax exempt bond requirements and the percentage of units that must be set-aside for low-income residents in order for the home to be totally exempt. (5)  Homes or CCRCs financed by tax exempt bonds--Generally.   All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home or CCRC may be totally exempt from property tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed for construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home or CCRC to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents. (a) The percentage of set-aside units required will vary depending on whether the home is a CCRC, the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained, the type of dwelling unit, and the receipt of Medicaid funds.  The set-aside requirements for homes are set forth in subsection (6) of this section and for CCRCs are set forth in subsection (7) of this section. (b) The exemption will be granted in direct correlation (( between ))  to  the total amount financed by tax exempt bonds and the portion of the home or CCRC that is constructed, acquired, rehabilitated, or refinanced by tax exempt bonds. (c) If tax exempt bonds are used for refinancing, the set-aside requirements set forth in subsections (6) and (7) of this section will be applied to the actual area or portion of the home or CCRC to which the bonds correspond. (i) Example 1.  A CCRC (that accepts Medicaid funds) is composed of a multistory building, six duplexes, and two independent homes and the CCRC has secured tax exempt bonds to satisfy an existing mortgage on the multistory building.  Only the multistory building will be considered eligible for a total exemption from property tax because of tax exempt bond financing. To receive the exemption, at least twenty percent of the dwelling units of the multistory building must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income or at least forty percent of the dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. (ii) Example 2.  A home obtains tax exempt bonds to refinance a portion of the home and to fund construction.  The department will separately consider the area of the home that corresponds to the purpose for which the tax exempt bonds were obtained.  The set-aside requirements related to refinancing will be applied to the portion of the home that corresponds to the mortgage being refinanced and the set-aside requirements related to construction will be applied to the area of the home to be newly constructed.  The department will determine the eligibility for partial exemption of the remainder of the home that is not being refinanced or constructed. (d) If a total exemption is granted under the tax exempt bond financing provision, the total exemption will remain in effect as long as: (i) The home or CCRC remains in compliance with the requirements under which it received the tax exempt bonds; (ii) The tax exempt bonds are outstanding; and (iii) The set-aside requirements are met. (e) If a home or CCRC has obtained tax exempt bond financing to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge its existing facility and the project does not meet the definition of rehabilitation contained in subsection (2) of this section, the project will not be considered a rehabilitation (( and )) .  In this situation,  the set-aside requirements related to refinancing or acquisition will be applied in determining eligibility for a total exemption. (f) When a home or CCRC no longer meets the criteria for exemption under the tax exempt bond financing portion of the statute, eligibility for exemption under  RCW 84.34.041  will be determined by the other provisions of the statute.  In other words, a home may receive a total or partial exemption depending on the number of residents who are deemed to be ""eligible residents"" or who require ""assistance with activities of daily living."" For example, if a home that previously received a total exemption due to the receipt of tax exempt bond financing has one hundred dwelling units and sixty of those dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive a total exemption. (6)  Set-aside requirements related to homes and tax exempt bond financing.   A specified number of dwelling units within a home must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for homes will be determined according to the type of dwelling units contained in the home and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to CCRCs.  The specific set-aside requirements for CCRCs are described in subsection (7) of this section.  A home must meet the following set-aside requirements to be totally exempt from property tax:   PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING   TYPE OF DWELLING UNIT   SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS     New construction  or  Rehabilitation   Complete  Separate units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   Complete  Separate units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside  for residents at or below 50% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   Complete  Separate units   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for  residents at or below 60% of local median income     Acquisition, New Construction, Refinancing,  or  Rehabilitation   Shared units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income        (7)  Set-aside requirements related to CCRCs and tax exempt bond financing.   A specified number of dwelling units of a CCRC must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for CCRCs will be determined by whether the CCRC does or does not have Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to other homes.  The specific set-aside requirements for other homes are described in subsection (6) of this section. (a) The continuing care contract between the resident and the CCRC is a contract to provide shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services to the resident for the duration of the resident's life or for a term in excess of one year.  A resident's tenancy may not be terminated due to inability of the resident to fully pay the monthly service fee when the resident establishes facts to justify a waiver or reduction of these charges.  This provision shall not apply if the resident, without the CCRC's consent, has impaired his and/or her ability to meet financial obligations required by the continuing care contract due to a transfer of assets, after signing the continuing care contract, other than to meet ordinary and customary living expenses, or by incurring unusual or unnecessary new financial obligations. (b) A CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents may not receive Medicaid funds from Washington state or the federal government during the term that the bonds are outstanding, except during the initial transition period as allowed by state law or if the regulatory agreement with the tax exempt bond financier exempts the CCRC from compliance with this requirement. (c) The following set-aside requirements must be met by CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) to receive a total exemption:   PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING   SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS     New construction  or  Rehabilitation   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income       (d) The following set-aside requirements must be met by CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds to receive a total exemption:   PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING   SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS     New construction  or  Rehabilitation   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income     Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income       (8)  Partial exemption.   If a home does not qualify for a total exemption from property tax, the home may receive a partial exemption for its real property on a unit by unit basis and a total exemption for its personal property. (a) Real property exemption.  If the real property of a home is used in the following ways, the portion of the real property so used will be exempt and the home may receive a partial exemption for: (i) Each dwelling unit occupied by a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living; (ii) Each dwelling unit occupied by an eligible resident; and  (iii) Common or shared areas of the home that are jointly used for two or more purposes that are exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW . (b) Assistance with activities of daily living.  A home may receive a partial exemption for each dwelling unit that is occupied by a resident who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and the home provides, brokers, facilitates, or contracts for the provision of this assistance.  A resident requiring assistance with the activities of daily living must be a resident who requires significant assistance with at least three of the nonexclusive list of activities set forth below and who, unless (( he or she ))  the resident  receives the assistance, would be at risk of being placed in a nursing home.  Activities of daily living include, but are not limited to: (i) Shopping; (ii) Meal and/or food preparation; (iii) Housekeeping; (iv) Transportation; (v) Dressing; (vi) Bathing; (vii) General personal hygiene; (viii) Monitoring of medication;  (ix) Ambulatory services; (x) Laundry services; (xi) Incontinence management; and (xii) Cuing for the cognitively impaired. (c) Examples of assistance with the activities of daily living: (i) If the resident of a home requires (( someone to assist him or her ))  assistance  with daily dressing, bathing, and personal hygiene, weekly housekeeping chores, and daily meal preparation, (( he or she ))  the person  is a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living and the home may receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit in which (( he or she ))  the person  resides. (ii) If the resident of a CCRC only requires someone to clean (( his or her ))  the  house weekly and to do the laundry weekly, the resident does not require significant assistance with activities of daily living and the CCRC may not receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit. (d) Common or shared areas.  Areas of a home that are jointly used for two or more purposes exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW  will be exempted under  RCW 84.36.041 . (i) The joint use of the common or shared areas must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  A kitchen, dining room, and laundry room are examples of the types of common or shared areas for which a partial property tax exemption may be granted.  (ii) Example.  A nonprofit organization uses its facility as a home for the aging and a nursing home.  The home and nursing home jointly use the kitchen and dining room.  The home may receive a property tax exemption for the common or shared areas under  RCW 84.36.041 .  The eligibility of the other areas of the facility will be determined by the appropriate statute.  The home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.040 . (e) Amount of partial exemption.  The amount of partial exemption will be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, minus/less the assessed value of any common or shared areas, by a fraction.   The numerator and denominator of the fraction will vary depending on the first assessment year the home became operational and occupied by eligible residents. (i) Numerator.  If the home becomes operational after the January 1st assessment date, the numerator is the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living on December 31st.  The December 31st date will be used only in the first year of operation.  In any other assessment year, t he numerator (( of the fraction )) is the number of the dwelling units occupied on January 1st of the assessment year by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living. (ii) Denominator.  If the home becomes operational after the January 1st assessment date, the denominator is the number of dwelling units occupied on December 31st.  The December 31st date will be used only in the first assessment year the home becomes operational.  In any other assessment year, t he denominator (( of the fraction )) is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of January 1st of the assessment year. (iii)  Example:     Assessed value of home:   $500,000       Less assessed value of common area:     - 80,000       Total   $420,000         Number of units occupied on 1/1 by  eligible residents and people requiring assistance with daily living activities  Total of occupied units on 1/1     =    6 40 or.15         $420,000 x .15 = $63,000 Amount of partial exemption       $420,000 - $63,000 = $357,000 Taxable value of home       (f) Valuation of the home.  The assessor will value a home that receives a partial exemption by considering only the current use of the property during the period in which the partial exemption is received and will not consider any potential use of the property. (9)  Income verification required from some residents.   If a home seeks a total property tax exemption because at least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents or seeks to receive a partial exemption based upon the number of units occupied by eligible residents, the residents must submit income verification forms.  The department may request income verification forms from residents of homes receiving a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing. (a) The income verification forms must be submitted to the assessor of the county in which the home is located by July 1st of the assessment year in which the application for exemption is made.   If the home becomes operational after the January 1st assessment date, these forms must be submitted to the assessor as soon as they are available but no later than December 31st of that assessment year. (b) The income verification form will be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. (c) If an eligible resident filed an income verification form for a previous year, (( he or she ))  the resident  is not required to submit a new form unless there is a change in status affecting the resident's eligibility, such as a significant increase or decrease in disposable income, or the assessor or the department requests a new income verification form to be submitted. (10)  Additional requirements.   Any nonprofit home for the aging that applies for a property tax exemption under this section must also comply with the provisions of  WAC 458-16A-020  and 458-16-165.   WAC 458-16A-020  contains information regarding the initial application and renewal procedures relating to the exemption discussed in this section.   WAC 458-16-165  sets forth additional requirements that must be complied with to obtain a property tax exemption pursuant to  RCW 84.36.041 .

(1)  Introduction.   This section explains the initial application process that must be followed (( for ))  when  a home for the aging wishes to obtain a property tax exemption under  RCW 84.36.041 .  This section also describes the annual renewal requirements that a home must follow to retain its  tax  exempt status, as well as the role of the assessor's office and the department of revenue in administering this exemption.  Throughout this section, all requirements will pertain to all types of homes for the aging including, but not limited to, adult care homes, assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities (CCRC), and independent housing. (2)  Definitions.   For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: (a) ""Assessor"" means the county assessor or any agency or person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the assessor. (b) ""Combined disposable income"" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of (( his or her ))  the persons's  spouse, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or (( his or her ))  the person's  spouse or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. (i) If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding calendar year, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person during the months the person was retired by twelve. (ii) If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding calendar year by reason of the death of the person's spouse, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person after the death of the spouse by twelve. (c) ""Continuing care retirement community"" or ""CCRC"" means an entity that provides shelter and services under continuing care contracts with its residents or includes a health care facility or health service. (d) ""Continuing care contract"" means a contract to provide a person, for the duration of that person's life or for a term in excess of one year, shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services, that is conditioned upon the transfer of property, the payment of an entrance fee to the provider of the services, and/or the payment of periodic charges in consideration for the care and services provided. A continuing care contract is not excluded from this definition because the contract is mutually terminable or because shelter and services are not provided at the same location. (e) ""Cotenant"" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident. (f) ""Department"" means the department of revenue. (g) ""Eligible resident"" means a person who: (i) Occupied the dwelling unit as (( his or her ))  their  principal place of residence as of  December 31st of the assessment year the home first became operational or in each subsequent year, occupied the dwelling unit as their principal place of residence as of  January 1st of the  assessment  year (( in which the claim for exemption is filed.  The exemption will continue if the )) .  If an  eligible resident is confined to a hospital or nursing home and the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or occupied by a spouse, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both , the dwelling will still be considered occupied by the eligible resident ; (ii) Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of physical disability.  A surviving spouse of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify for this exemption if the surviving spouse is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and (iii) Has a combined disposable income that is no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as determined by federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the county in which the person resides. (h)  ""First assessment year the home becomes operational"" or ""the assessment year the home first became operational"" means the first year the home becomes occupied by and provides services to eligible residents.  Depending upon the facts, this year will be the year during which construction of the home is completed or the year during which a nonprofit organization purchases or acquires an existing home and begins to operate it as a nonprofit home for the aging. (i)  ""Homes for the aging"" or ""home(s)"" means a residential housing facility that: (i) Provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) Has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) Provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. (( (i) ))  (j)  ""HUD"" means the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.  (( (j) ))  (k)  ""Occupied dwelling unit"" means a living unit that is occupied  either  on January 1st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed  or on December 31st of the first assessment year the home becomes operational and in which the claim for exemption is filed . (( (k) ))  (l)  ""Property that is reasonably necessary"" means all property that is: (i) Operated and used by a home; and (ii) The use of which is restricted to residents, guests, or employees of a home. (3)  Application for exemption.   The tax exemption authorized by  RCW 84.36.041  is claimed by and benefits a nonprofit home for the aging, not the residents of (( a ))  the  home.  Therefore, the claim for this exemption is submitted by a home to the department. (a) If a claim for exemption is filed on behalf of a home under  RCW 84.36.041  and the exemption is granted, no resident of that home may receive a personal exemption under  RCW 84.36.381 . (b) A listing of the varying levels of care and supervision provided or coordinated by the home must accompany all initial applications submitted for exemption.  Examples of the varying levels of care and supervision include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) Conducting routine room checks; (ii) Arranging for or providing transportation; (iii) Arranging for or providing meals; (iv) On site medical personnel; (v) Monitoring of medication; or (vi) Housekeeping services. (c) Homes having real property that is used for purposes other than as a home (for example, property used for a barber shop) must provide the department with a floor plan identifying the square footage devoted to each exempt and nonexempt use. (d) At the time an application for exemption is submitted, the home must submit proof that it is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c) organization. (e) Homes that apply for a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing must submit a copy of the regulatory agreement between the home and the entity that issues the bonds.  When only a portion of the home is financed by a program using tax exempt bonds, the home must submit a site plan of the home indicating the areas so financed. (4)  Segregation.   A nonprofit organization that provides shelter and services to elderly and disabled individuals may use the facility for more than one purpose that is exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  Property that is used for more than one exempt purpose and that qualifies for exemption under a statute other than  RCW 84.36.041  will be segregated and exempted pursuant to the applicable statute. (a) If a home includes a nursing home, the department will segregate the home and the part of the facility that is used as a nursing home.  The department will separately determine the eligibility of the home under  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home under  RCW 84.36.040  for the property tax exemption available under each statute.     Exception:   If the home does not receive Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) and is seeking a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing, the home and nursing home will be considered as a whole when the set-aside requirements are applied.        (b) Dwelling units that are occupied by residents who do not meet the age or disability requirements of  RCW 84.36.041  will be segregated and taxed. (c) Common or shared areas.  Areas of a home that are jointly used for two or more purposes exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW  will be exempted under  RCW 84.36.041 . (i) The joint use of the common or shared areas must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  A kitchen, dining room, and laundry room are examples of the types of common or shared areas for which a property tax exemption may be granted. (ii) Example.  A nonprofit organization uses its facility as a home for the aging and a nursing home.  The home and nursing home jointly use the kitchen and dining room.  The home may receive a property tax exemption for the common or shared areas under  RCW 84.36.041 .  The eligibility of the other areas of the facility will be determined by the appropriate statute.  The home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.040 . (5)  Homes subsidized by HUD.   Homes subsidized by a HUD program must initially and each March 31st thereafter provide the department with a letter of certification from HUD of continued HUD subsidy and a list of the name, age, and/or disability of all residents.   If the property is subsidized by more than one HUD contract and one of the contracts expires or is otherwise no longer in effect, the eligibility of the portion of the facility still subsidized by HUD will be conditioned on receipt of a letter of certification from HUD and a listing of all persons residing on the property.  The eligibility of the remainder of the property will be determined by the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents on January 1st following the expiration or cancellation of the HUD subsidy. (6)  Homes that are not subsidized by HUD.   If a home is not subsidized by HUD or does not meet the requirements to receive a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing, it may receive a total or partial exemption from property tax.  The extent of the exemption will be determined by the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents.  If more than fifty percent of the dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive a total exemption.  Alternatively, if less than fifty percent of the dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive partial exemption for its real property on a unit by unit basis and a total exemption for its personal property. An income verification form(( , Form REV 64-0043, )) will be used to determine if a resident of a home meets the criteria of ""eligible resident.""   During the initial application process, the residents of a home applying for exemption will be asked to submit an income verification form with the assessor of the county in which the home is located and the assessor and/or the department may request any relevant information deemed necessary to make a determination. (a) (( Between January 1st and July 1st of the year preceding the year in which the tax is due, residents must file Form REV 64-0043 with the assessor of the county in which the home is located. ))  The type of income verification form required and its due date depends upon the date the home first became operational and began to provide services to eligible residents: (i) If the home was operating and providing services to eligible residents on the January 1st assessment date, the residents are to submit Form REV 64-0043 between January 1st and July 1st of the year preceding the year in which the tax is due; or (ii) If the home started operating and providing services to eligible residents after the January 1st assessment date, the residents are to submit Form REV 64-0042 on or before December 31st of the year preceding the year in which the tax is due.  In this situation, no income verification forms will be required during the following year if the same eligible residents occupy the same dwelling units on December 31st and January 1st of the subsequent year. (b) If two or more residents occupy one unit, only one cotenant is required to file verification of combined disposable income, as defined in subsection (2) of this section, with the assessor.  (c) Form REV 64-0043 will not be accepted by the assessor if it is submitted or postmarked after July 1st  unless the assessor and/or the department has agreed to waive this deadline.  Form REV 64-0042 will not be accepted if it is submitted or postmarked after December 31st unless the assessor and/or department agrees to waive this deadline .  (d)  After the application for exemption is approved, residents will not be required to file a new income verification form unless a change in their circumstances occurs or the assessor requests it.  However, a t any time after the initial application (( for exemption )) is approved, assessors and/or the department may: (i) Request residents to complete Form REV 64-0043(( , the verification of income form )); (ii) Conduct audits; and (iii) Request other relevant information to ensure continued eligibility.  (e) (( If ))  By March 31st each year,  a home not subsidized by HUD  that  wishes to retain its exempt property tax status(( , the home )) must (( by March 31st of each year )) file with the department a list of the total number of dwelling units in (( their ))  its  complex, the number of occupied dwelling units in (( their ))  its  complex as of January 1st, the number of previously qualified dwelling units in (( their ))  its  complex that are no longer occupied by the same eligible residents, and a list of the name, age, and/or disability of all residents and the date upon which they moved into or occupied the home.   If a home's eligibility was based upon the number of units occupied on December 31st, the home must only provide the department with an amended list of additions or deletions as of the subsequent January 1st assessment date. (7)  Homes financed by tax exempt bonds.   Homes that receive a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing must initially and each March 31st thereafter provide the department with a letter of certification from the agency or organization monitoring compliance with the bond requirements.  The letter of certification must verify that the home is in full compliance with all requirements and set-asides of the underlying regulatory agreement. (a) If the set-aside requirements contained in the regulatory agreement differ from the set-aside requirements established by the department and set forth in  WAC 458-16A-010 , the department may require the residents of the home to submit income verification forms (Form REV  64-0042 or  64-0043) to the assessor of the county in which the home is located. (b) (( The ))  A  home  for the aging that is receiving a property tax exemption  must (( also )) annually submit a list of the name, age, and/or disability of all residents  in the home  to the department. (8)  Assessor's responsibilities.   Assessors will determine the age or disability and income eligibility of all residents who file Form REV  64-0042 or  64-0043, the income verification form s .  By July 15th each year  or by January 15th of the assessment year following the first assessment year a home becomes operational , the assessor will forward a copy of Form REV  64-0042 or  64-0043 to the department for each resident who meets the eligibility requirements. (9) (( Department of revenue responsibilities.   The department will make its determination by August 31st, or within thirty days of the date all required information is submitted to the department, of the exempt status of a home that applies for this exemption. (10) ))  Appeals.   An applicant who is determined not to be an ""eligible resident"" by the assessor and a home that is denied a property tax exemption by the department each have the right to appeal.  Appeals must be filed within thirty days of the date the notice of ineligibility or denial was mailed by the assessor or the department. (a) If the assessor determines that an applicant does not meet the (( criteria to be ))  definition of  an ""eligible resident"" (( of a home )), the resident may appeal this decision to the board of equalization of the county in which the home is located. (b) If the department denies, in whole or in part, an application for exemption, the home may appeal this denial to the state board of tax appeals. (( (11) ))  (10)   Additional requirements.   Any nonprofit home for the aging that applies for a property tax exemption under this section must also comply with the provisions of  WAC 458-16A-010  and 458-16-165.   WAC 458-16A-010  contains information regarding the basic eligibility requirements to receive a total or partial exemption under  RCW 84.36.041 .

The director shall, as provided in subdivision (5) of subsection 1 of this section, assess an operator points for a conviction pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection 1 of section 302.020, when the director issues such operator a license or permit pursuant to the provisions of sections 302.010 to 302.340.                  3.  An additional two points shall be assessed when personal injury or property damage results from any violation listed in subsection 1 of this section and if found to be warranted and certified by the reporting court.                  4.  When any of the acts listed in subdivision (2), (3), (4) or (8) of subsection 1 of this section constitutes both a violation of a state law and a violation of a county or municipal ordinance, points may be assessed for either violation but not for both.  Notwithstanding that an offense arising out of the same occurrence could be construed to be a violation of subdivisions (8), (9) and (10) of subsection 1 of this section, no person shall be tried or convicted for more than one offense pursuant to subdivisions (8), (9) and (10) of subsection 1 of this section for offenses arising out of the same occurrence.                  5.  The director of revenue shall put into effect a system for staying the assessment of points against an operator.  The system shall provide that the satisfactory completion of a driver-improvement program or, in the case of violations committed while operating a motorcycle, a motorcycle-rider training course approved by the director of the department of public safety, by an operator, when so ordered and verified by any court having jurisdiction over any law of this state or county or municipal ordinance, regulating motor vehicles, other than a violation committed in a commercial motor vehicle as defined in section 302.700  or a violation committed by an individual who has been issued a commercial driver's license or is required to obtain a commercial driver's license in this state or any other state , shall be accepted by the director in lieu of the assessment of points for a violation pursuant to subdivision (1), (2) or (4) of subsection 1 of this section or pursuant to subsection 3 of this section.  For the purposes of this subsection, the driver-improvement program shall meet or exceed the standards of the National Safety Council's eight-hour ""Defensive Driving Course"" or, in the case of a violation which occurred during the operation of a motorcycle, the program shall meet the standards established by the director of the department of public safety pursuant to sections 302.133 to 302.138.  The completion of a driver-improvement program or a motorcycle-rider training course shall not be accepted in lieu of points more than one time in any thirty-six-month period and shall be completed within sixty days of the date of conviction in order to be accepted in lieu of the assessment of points.  Every court having jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall, within fifteen days after completion of the driver-improvement program or motorcycle-rider training course by an operator, forward a record of the completion to the director, all other provisions of the law to the contrary notwithstanding.  The director shall establish procedures for record keeping and the administration of this subsection.                  302.309.  1.  Whenever any license is suspended pursuant to sections 302.302 to 302.309, the director of revenue shall return the license to the operator immediately upon the termination of the period of suspension and upon compliance with the requirements of chapter 303, RSMo.                2.  Any operator whose license is revoked pursuant to these sections, upon the termination of the period of revocation, shall apply for a new license in the manner prescribed by law.                  3.  (1)  All circuit courts or the director of revenue shall have jurisdiction to hear applications and make eligibility determinations granting limited driving privileges.  Any application may be made in writing to the director of revenue and the person's reasons for requesting the limited driving privilege shall be made therein.                  (2)  When any court of record having jurisdiction or the director of revenue finds that an operator is required to operate a motor vehicle in connection with any of the following:                 (a)  A business, occupation, or employment;                 (b)  Seeking medical treatment for such operator;                 (c)  Attending school or other institution of higher education;                 (d)  Attending alcohol or drug treatment programs; or                 (e)  Any other circumstance the court or director finds would create an undue hardship on the operator;        the court or director may grant such limited driving privilege as the circumstances of the case justify if the court or director finds undue hardship would result to the individual, and while so operating a motor vehicle within the restrictions and limitations of the limited driving privilege the driver shall not be guilty of operating a motor vehicle without a valid license.                  (3)  An operator may make application to the proper court in the county in which such operator resides or in the county in which is located the operator's principal place of business or employment.  Any application for a limited driving privilege made to a circuit court shall name the director as a party defendant and shall be served upon the director prior to the grant of any limited privilege, and shall be accompanied by a copy of the applicant's driving record as certified by the director.  Any applicant for a limited driving privilege shall have on file with the department of revenue proof of financial responsibility as required by chapter 303, RSMo.  Any application by a person who transports persons or property as classified in section 302.015 may be accompanied by proof of financial responsibility as required by chapter 303, RSMo, but if proof of financial responsibility does not accompany the application, or if the applicant does not have on file with the department of revenue proof of financial responsibility, the court or the director has discretion to grant the limited driving privilege to the person solely for the purpose of operating a vehicle whose owner has complied with chapter 303, RSMo, for that vehicle, and the limited driving privilege must state such restriction.  When operating such vehicle under such restriction the person shall carry proof that the owner has complied with chapter 303, RSMo, for that vehicle.                  (4)  The court order or the director's grant of the limited driving privilege shall indicate the termination date of the privilege, which shall be not later than the end of the period of suspension or revocation.  A copy of any court order shall be sent by the clerk of the court to the director, and a copy shall be given to the driver which shall be carried by the driver whenever such driver operates a motor vehicle.  The director of revenue upon granting a limited driving privilege shall give a copy of the limited driving privilege to the applicant.  The applicant shall carry a copy of the limited driving privilege while operating a motor vehicle.  A conviction which results in the assessment of points pursuant to section 302.302, other than a violation of a municipal stop sign ordinance where no accident is involved, against a driver who is operating a vehicle pursuant to a limited driving privilege terminates the privilege, as of the date the points are assessed to the person's driving record.  If the date of arrest is prior to the issuance of the limited driving privilege, the privilege shall not be terminated.  The director shall notify by ordinary mail the driver whose privilege is so terminated.                  (5)  Except as provided in subdivision (6) of this subsection, no person is eligible to receive a limited driving privilege who at the time of application for a limited driving privilege has previously been granted such a privilege within the immediately preceding five years, or whose license has been suspended or revoked for the following reasons:                 (a)  A conviction of violating the provisions of section 577.010 or 577.012, RSMo, or any similar provision of any federal or state law, or a municipal or county law where the judge in such case was an attorney and the defendant was represented by or waived the right to an attorney in writing, until the person has completed the first thirty days of a suspension or revocation imposed pursuant to this chapter;                 (b)  A conviction of any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle was used;                 (c)  Ineligibility for a license because of the provisions of subdivision (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) or (11) of section 302.060;                 (d)  Because of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of narcotic drugs, a controlled substance as defined in chapter 195, RSMo, or having left the scene of an accident as provided in section 577.060, RSMo;                 (e)  Due to a revocation for the first time for failure to submit to a chemical test pursuant to section 577.041, RSMo, or due to a refusal to submit to a chemical test in any other state, if such person has not completed the first ninety days of such revocation;                 (f)  Violation more than once of the provisions of section 577.041, RSMo, or a similar implied consent law of any other state;  or                  (g)   [ Disqualification of a commercial driver's license pursuant to sections 302.700 to 302.780, however, nothing in this subsection shall prevent a person holding a commercial driver's license who is suspended or revoked as a result of an action occurring while not driving a commercial motor vehicle or driving for pay, but while driving in an individual capacity as an operator of a personal vehicle from applying for a limited driving privilege to operate a commercial vehicle, if otherwise eligible for such limited privilege; or                 (h) ]   Due to a suspension pursuant to subsection 2 of section 302.525 and who has not completed the first thirty days of such suspension, provided the person is not otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege; or due to a revocation pursuant to subsection 2 of section 302.525 if such person has not completed such revocation.                  (6)   No person who possesses a commercial driver's license shall receive a limited driving privilege issued for the purpose of operating a commercial motor vehicle if such person's driving privilege is suspended, revoked, canceled, denied, or disqualified.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the issuance of a limited driving privilege for the purpose of operating a noncommercial motor vehicle provided that pursuant to the provisions of this section, the applicant is not otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege.                (7)  (a)  Provided that pursuant to the provisions of this section, the applicant is not otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege, a circuit court or the director may, in the manner prescribed in this subsection, allow a person who has had such person's license to operate a motor vehicle revoked where that person cannot obtain a new license for a period of ten years, as prescribed in subdivision (9) of section 302.060, to apply for a limited driving privilege pursuant to this subsection if such person has served at least three years of such disqualification or revocation.  Such person shall present evidence satisfactory to the court or the director that such person has not been convicted of any offense related to alcohol, controlled substances or drugs during the preceding three years and that the person's habits and conduct show that the person no longer poses a threat to the public safety of this state.                  (b)  Provided that pursuant to the provisions of this section, the applicant is not otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege or convicted of involuntary manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle in an intoxicated condition, a circuit court or the director may, in the manner prescribed in this subsection, allow a person who has had such person's license to operate a motor vehicle revoked where that person cannot obtain a new license for a period of five years because of two convictions of driving while intoxicated, as prescribed in subdivision (10) of section 302.060, to apply for a limited driving privilege pursuant to this subsection if such person has served at least two years of such disqualification or revocation.  Such person shall present evidence satisfactory to the court or the director that such person has not been convicted of any offense related to alcohol, controlled substances or drugs during the preceding two years and that the person's habits and conduct show that the person no longer poses a threat to the public safety of this state.  Any person who is denied a license permanently in this state because of an alcohol-related conviction subsequent to a restoration of such person's driving privileges pursuant to subdivision (9) of section 302.060 shall not be eligible for limited driving privilege pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.                  4.  Any person who has received notice of denial of a request of limited driving privilege by the director of revenue may make a request for a review of the director's determination in the circuit court of the county in which the person resides or the county in which is located the person's principal place of business or employment within thirty days of the date of mailing of the notice of denial.  Such review shall be based upon the records of the department of revenue and other competent evidence and shall be limited to a review of whether the applicant was statutorily entitled to the limited driving privilege.                  5.  The director of revenue shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.  Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, RSMo, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536, RSMo, and, if applicable, section 536.028, RSMo.  This section and chapter 536, RSMo, are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536, RSMo, to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2001, shall be invalid and void.                 302.700.  1.

GX124-46-4355573	"WSR 99-04-016 PERMANENT RULES DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE [ Filed January 22, 1999,  3:03 p.m. ] Date of Adoption:  January 22, 1999. Purpose:  This rule explains the basis and requirements for the property tax exemption, both partial and total, available to homes for the aging under  RCW 84.36.041 .

The amendments to this rule establish that a home initially financed by and granted exemption because of tax exempt bond financing will retain the same set-aside requirements for low-income residents if they refinance the original bond issue.

(1)  Introduction.   Under  RCW 84.36.041 , a nonprofit home for the aging may be totally or partially exempt from property tax.  This section explains the exemptions allowed and the criteria that must be met in order to receive an exemption under this statute.  Throughout this section, all requirements will pertain to all types of homes for the aging including, but not limited to, adult care homes, assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities (CCRC), and independent housing, unless a particular type of home is separately identified. (2)  Definitions.   For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: (a) ""Acquisition"" means that an existing home for the aging (or home) currently in operation is acquired by a nonprofit organization and the ownership of the facility will change as a result of a purchase, gift, foreclosure, or other method. (b) ""Assistance with activities of daily living"" means the home provides, brokers, or contracts for the provision of auxiliary services to residents, such as meal and housekeeping service, transportation, ambulatory service, and attendant care including, but not limited to, bathing and other acts related to personal hygiene, dressing, shopping, food preparation, monitoring of medication, and laundry services. (c) ""Combined disposable income"" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of his or her spouse, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or his or her spouse or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. (i) If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding calendar year, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person during the months the person was retired by twelve. (ii) If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding calendar year (( by reason ))  because  of the death of the person's spouse, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person after the death of the spouse by twelve. (d) ""Complete and separate dwelling units"" means that the individual units of a home contain complete facilities for living, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation. (e) ""Construction"" means the actual construction or building of all or a portion of a home that did not exist prior to the construction.

(g) ""Continuing care contract"" means a contract to provide a person, for the duration of that person's life or for a term in excess of one year, shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services, that is conditioned upon the transfer of property, the payment of an entrance fee to the provider of the services, and/or the payment of periodic charges in consideration for the care and services provided.  A continuing care contract is not excluded from this definition because the contract is mutually terminable or because shelter and services are not provided at the same location. (h) ""Cotenant"" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident. (i) ""Disposable income"" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended prior to January 1, 1994, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income: (i) Capital gains, other than nonrecognized gain on the sale of a principal residence under section 1034 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, or gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal Internal Revenue Code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence; (ii) Amounts deducted for loss; (iii) Amounts deducted for depreciation; (iv) Pension and annuity receipts; (v) Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vi) Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vii) Federal Social Security Act and railroad retirement benefits; (viii) Dividend receipts; and (ix) Interest received on state and municipal bonds. (j) ""Eligible resident"" means a person who: (i) Occupied the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of January 1st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed.  The exemption will not be nullified if the eligible resident is confined to a hospital or nursing home and the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or occupied by a spouse, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both; (ii) Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of physical disability.  A surviving spouse of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify for this exemption if the surviving spouse is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and (iii) Has a combined disposable income that is no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as determined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the county in which the person resides and in effect as of January 1 of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (k) ""Home for the aging"" or ""home"" means a residential housing facility that: (i) Provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) Has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) Provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. (l) ""HUD"" means the federal Department of Housing and Urban  Development. (m) ""Local median income"" means the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect on January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (n) ""Low income"" means that the combined disposable income of a resident is eighty percent or less of the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect as of January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (o) ""Occupied dwelling unit"" means a living unit that is occupied on January 1st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed. (p) ""Property that is reasonably necessary"" means all property that is: (i) Operated and used by a home; and (ii) The use of which is restricted to residents, guests, or employees of a home. (q) ""Refinancing"" means the discharge of an existing debt with funds obtained through the creation of new debt.  For purposes of this section, even if the application for tax exempt bond financing to refinance existing debt is treated by the financing agent as something other than refinancing, an application for a property tax exemption because of refinancing by tax exempt bonds will be treated as refinancing and the set-asides specific to refinancing will be applied.  ""Refinancing"" shall include tax exempt bond financing in excess of the amount of existing debt that is obtained to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge a facility currently being operated as a home. (r) ""Rehabilitation"" means that an existing building or structure, not currently used as a home, will be modified, improved, restored, extended, or enlarged so that it will be used as a home for elderly and disabled individuals.  A project will be considered a rehabilitation if the costs of rehabilitation exceed five thousand dollars.  If a home has acquired tax exempt bond financing and does not meet the definition of ""rehabilitation"" contained in this subsection, the home may be eligible for a total exemption under the ""refinancing"" definition and if it meets the ""refinancing"" set-aside requirements.  If such a home is not eligible for a total exemption, the department will determine the home's eligibility for a partial exemption in accordance with the pertinent parts of  RCW 84.36.041  and this section. (s) ""Set-aside(s)"" means the percentage of dwelling units reserved for low-income residents when the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a financing program using tax exempt bonds. (t) ""Shared dwelling units"" or ""shared units"" means individual dwelling units of a home that do not contain complete facilities for living, eating, cooking, and sanitation. (u) ""Taxable value"" means the value of the home upon which the tax rate is applied in order to determine the amount of property taxes due. (v) ""Total amount financed"" means the total amount of financing required by the home to fund construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, or refinancing.  Seventy-five percent of this amount must be supplied by tax exempt bonds to receive the total exemption from property tax available under the tax exempt bond financing provision of  RCW 84.36.041 . (3)  General requirements.   To be exempt under this section, a home for the aging must be: (a) Exclusively used for the purposes for which exemption is granted, except as provided in  RCW 84.36.805 ; (b) Operated by an organization that is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code; and (c) The benefit of the exemption must inure to the home. (4)  Total exemption.   There are three ways in which a home may be totally exempt from property tax.  All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt if it meets the general requirements listed in subsection (3) of this section and: (a) At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents; (b) The home is subsidized under a HUD program; or (c) The construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents.  See subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this section for tax exempt bond requirements and the percentage of units that must be set-aside for low-income residents in order for the home to be totally exempt. (5)  Homes or CCRCs financed by tax exempt bonds--Generally.   All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home or CCRC may be totally exempt from property tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed for construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home or CCRC to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents. (a) The percentage of set-aside units required will vary depending on whether the home is a CCRC, the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained, the type of dwelling unit, and the receipt of Medicaid funds.  The set-aside requirements for homes are set forth in subsection (6) of this section and for CCRCs are set forth in subsection (7) of this section. (b) The exemption will be granted in direct correlation between the total amount financed by tax exempt bonds and the portion of the home or CCRC that is constructed, acquired, rehabilitated, or refinanced by tax exempt bonds. (c) If tax exempt bonds are used for refinancing, the set-aside requirements set forth in subsections (6) and (7) of this section will be applied to the actual area or portion of the home or CCRC to which the bonds correspond. (i) Example 1.  A CCRC (that accepts Medicaid funds) is composed of a multistory building, six duplexes, and two independent homes and the CCRC has secured tax exempt bonds to satisfy an existing mortgage on the multistory building.  Only the multistory building will be considered eligible for a total exemption from property tax because of tax exempt bond financing. To receive the exemption, at least twenty percent of the dwelling units of the multistory building must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income or at least forty percent of the dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. (ii) Example 2.  A home obtains tax exempt bonds to refinance a portion of the home and to fund construction.  The department will separately consider the area of the home that corresponds to the purpose for which the tax exempt bonds were obtained.  The set-aside requirements related to refinancing will be applied to the portion of the home that corresponds to the mortgage being refinanced and the set-aside requirements related to construction will be applied to the area of the home to be newly constructed.  The department will determine the eligibility for partial exemption of the remainder of the home that is not being refinanced or constructed. (d) If a total exemption is granted under the tax exempt bond financing provision, the total exemption will remain in effect as long as: (i) The home or CCRC remains in compliance with the requirements under which it received the tax exempt bonds; (ii) The tax exempt bonds are outstanding; and (iii) The set-aside requirements are met. (e) If a home or CCRC has obtained tax exempt bond financing to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge its existing facility and the project does not meet the definition of rehabilitation contained in subsection (2) of this section, the project will not be considered a rehabilitation and the set-aside requirements related to refinancing or acquisition will be applied in determining eligibility for a total exemption. (f) When a home or CCRC no longer meets the criteria for exemption under the tax exempt bond financing portion of the statute, eligibility for exemption under  RCW 84.34.041  will be determined by the other provisions of the statute.  In other words, a home may receive a total or partial exemption depending on the number of residents who are deemed to be ""eligible residents"" or who require ""assistance with activities of daily living.""  For example, if a home that previously received a total exemption due to the receipt of tax exempt bond financing has one hundred dwelling units and sixty of those dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive a total exemption. (6)  Set-aside requirements related to homes and tax exempt bond financing.   A specified number of dwelling units within a home must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for homes will be determined according to the type of dwelling units contained in the home and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to CCRCs.  The specific set-aside requirements for CCRCs are described in subsection (7) of this section. (( (a) Complete and separate dwelling units - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a home with any complete and separate units, the following set-asides will apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. (b) Complete and separate dwelling units - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire or refinance a home with any complete and separate units, the following set-asides will apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. (c) Shared dwelling units - construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing.  If financing was obtained for the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home with only shared units, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. ))  A home must meet the following set-aside requirements to be totally exempt from property tax: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING TYPE OF DWELLING UNIT SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation Complete  Separate units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units   currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements Complete  Separate units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements Complete  Separate units 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income Acquisition, New Construction, Refinancing,  or  Rehabilitation Shared units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income (7)  Set-aside requirements related to CCRCs and tax exempt bond financing.    A specified number of dwelling units of a CCRC must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for CCRCs will be determined by whether the CCRC does or does not have Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to other homes.  The specific set-aside requirements for other homes are described in subsection (6) of this section. (a) The continuing care contract between the resident and the CCRC is a contract to provide shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services to the resident for the duration of the resident's life or for a term in excess of one year.  A resident's tenancy may not be terminated due to inability of the resident to fully pay the monthly service fee when the resident establishes facts to justify a waiver or reduction of these charges.  This provision shall not apply if the resident, without the CCRC's consent, has impaired his and/or her ability to meet financial obligations required by the continuing care contract due to a transfer of assets, after signing the continuing care contract, other than to meet ordinary and customary living expenses, or by incurring unusual or unnecessary new financial obligations. (b) A CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents may not receive Medicaid funds from Washington state or the federal government during the term that the bonds are outstanding, except during the initial transition period as allowed by state law or if the regulatory agreement with the tax exempt bond financier exempts the CCRC from compliance with this requirement. (c)  The following set-aside requirements must be met by  CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) (( - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Fifteen percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below one hundred percent of the local median income. (d) CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire a CCRC or to refinance a CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. ))  to receive a total exemption: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income (( (e) ))  (d) The following set-aside requirements must be met by  CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds((  - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a CCRC with Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. (f) CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire a CCRC or to refinance a CCRC with Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. ))  to receive a total exemption: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income (8)  Partial exemption.   If a home does not qualify for a total exemption from property tax, the home may receive a partial exemption for its real property on a unit by unit basis and a total exemption for its personal property. (a) Real property exemption.  If the real property of a home is used in the following ways, the portion of the real property so used will be exempt and the home may receive a partial exemption for: (i) Each dwelling unit occupied by a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living; (ii) Each dwelling unit occupied by an eligible resident; and  (iii) Common or shared areas of the home that are jointly used for two or more purposes that are exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW . (b) Assistance with activities of daily living.  A home may receive a partial exemption for each dwelling unit that is occupied by a resident who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and the home provides, brokers, facilitates, or contracts for the provision of this assistance.  A resident requiring assistance with the activities of daily living must be a resident who requires significant assistance with at least three of the nonexclusive list of activities set forth below and who, unless he or she receives the assistance, would be at risk of being placed in a nursing home.  Activities of daily living include, but are not limited to: (i) Shopping; (ii) Meal and/or food preparation; (iii) Housekeeping; (iv) Transportation; (v) Dressing; (vi) Bathing; (vii) General personal hygiene; (viii) Monitoring of medication;  (ix) Ambulatory services; (x) Laundry services; (xi) Incontinence management; and (xii) Cuing for the cognitively impaired. (c) Examples of assistance with the activities of daily living: (i) If the resident of a home requires someone to assist him or her with daily dressing, bathing, and personal hygiene, weekly housekeeping chores, and daily meal preparation, he or she is a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living and the home may receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit in which he or she resides. (ii) If the resident of a CCRC only requires someone to clean his or her house weekly and to do the laundry weekly, the resident does not require significant assistance with activities of daily living and the CCRC may not receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit. (d) Common or shared areas.  Areas of a home that are jointly used for two or more purposes exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW  will be exempted under  RCW 84.36.041 . (i) The joint use of the common or shared areas must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  A kitchen, dining room, and laundry room are examples of the types of common or shared areas for which a partial property tax exemption may be granted.  (ii) Example.  A nonprofit organization uses its facility as a home for the aging and a nursing home.  The home and nursing home jointly use the kitchen and dining room.  The home may receive a property tax exemption for the common or shared areas under  RCW 84.36.041 .  The eligibility of the other areas of the facility will be determined by the appropriate statute.  The home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.040 . (e) Amount of partial exemption.  The amount of partial exemption will be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, minus/less the assessed value of any common or shared areas, by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction is the number of the dwelling units occupied on January 1st of the assessment year by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living.  The denominator of the fraction is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of January 1st of the assessment year.  Example: Assessed value of home: $500,000 Less assessed value of common area:   - 80,000 Total $420,000 Number of units occupied on 1/1 by  eligible residents and people requiring assistance with daily living activities =  Total of occupied units on 1/1  6 40 or .15 $420,000 x .15= $63,000  Amount of partial exemption $420,000 - $63,000= $357,000  Taxable value of home (f) Valuation of the home.  The assessor will value a home that receives a partial exemption by considering only the current use of the property during the period in which the partial exemption is received and will not consider any potential use of the property. (9)  Income verification required from some residents.   If a home seeks a total property tax exemption because at least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents or seeks to receive a partial exemption based upon the number of units occupied by eligible residents, the residents must submit income verification forms.  The department may request income verification forms from residents of homes receiving a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing. (a) The income verification forms must be submitted to the assessor of the county in which the home is located by July 1st of the assessment year in which the application for exemption is made. (b) The income verification form will be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. (c) If an eligible resident filed an income verification form for a previous year, he or she is not required to submit a new form unless there is a change in status affecting the resident's eligibility, such as a significant increase or decrease in disposable income, or the assessor or the department requests a new income verification form to be submitted. (10) (( Three-year phase in for a home with increased taxable value.   If the taxable value of a home is increased because of the change in the method of calculating the amount of partial exemption, the increased taxable value shall be phased in over a period of three years. (a) Eligibility requirements for phase in.  If the home meets the following conditions the increased taxable value may be phased in: (i) The home was exempt or partially exempt for taxes levied in 1993 for collection in 1994; (ii) The home is partially exempt for taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995; and (iii) The taxable value of the home increased for taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995 due to the change prescribed by chapter 151, Laws of 1993 with respect to the numerator of the fraction used to determine the amount of partial exemption. (b) Method of phase in.  The increase in taxable value shall be phased in as follows: Column 1 Year Column 2 Value after partial exemption Column 3 Increase in Value (Col. 2 minus TV from Prior Year) Column 4 Annual % of Increase  to be Paid Column 5 Amount of Increase to be Paid (Col. 3 x Col 4) Column 6 Taxable Value (""TV"") (Col. 5 +TV from Prior Year) 1993 $292,300      $292,300 1994 $357,000*  $64,700 33.00% $21,351 $313,651 1995 $336,000** $22,349 50.00% $11,175 $324,826 1996 $325,500   $674    100.00%  $674     $325,500 1997 $367,500      $367,500 * This value is a continuation of the example in subsection (8)(e) of this section. ** For the purposes of this example, we are assuming that the home is located in a county on a four year revaluation cycle and that value of this home after the partial exemption will fluctuate each year because the number of eligible residents and residents who require assistance with the activities of daily living will change each year.  In this example, the number of units exempt from property tax within the home used in the example in subsection (8)(e) are as follows:  Eight in 1995, nine in 1996, and five in 1997. (i) For taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995, the home will pay taxes based on the taxable value in 1993 plus one-third of the increase in the taxable value from 1993 to the taxable value calculated under subsection (8)(e) of this section. (ii) For taxes levied in 1995 for collection in 1996, the home will pay taxes based on the taxable value in 1994 plus one-half of the increase in the taxable value from 1994 to the taxable value calculated under subsection (8)(e) of this section. (iii) For taxes levied in 1996 for collection in 1997 and for taxes levied thereafter, this subsection does not apply and the home will pay taxes on the taxable value without reference to this subsection. (c) Example:  Assume, for the purposes of this example, in 1993 the assessed value of a home was $475,000, the value of the shared area was $80,000, and twenty-six percent of the units were exempt.  Therefore, the assessed value minus the value of the shared area or $395,000 multiplied by .74= a taxable value of $292,300. (11) ))  Additional requirements.   Any nonprofit home for the aging that applies for a property tax exemption under this section must also comply with the provisions of  WAC 458-16A-020  and 458-16-165.   WAC 458-16A-020  contains information regarding the initial application and renewal procedures relating to the exemption discussed in this section.   WAC 458-16-165  sets forth additional requirements that must be complied with to obtain a property tax exemption pursuant to  RCW 84.36.041 .

Citation of Existing Rules Affected by this Order:  Amending  WAC 458-16A-010  Nonprofit homes for the aging. Statutory Authority for Adoption:   RCW 84.36.041  and 84.36.865. Under  RCW 34.05.350  the agency for good cause finds that immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest. Reasons for this Finding:  The amendments address the concerns of the Washington Association of Housing and Services for the Aging and the unintended results of the current set-aside requirements in the current rule.  When the current rule was adopted in 1995, the participants in the rule-making process failed to consider that a brand new facility financed with exempt bonds, which initially met the low income set-aside requirements, might need to refinance these bonds because of interest rate changes or market growth.  If such a facility is required to meet the higher set-aside requirements for low-income residents regarding refinancing contained in the current rule, the facility may lose its capacity to serve low-income residents because it may either lose its tax exempt status or ability to refinance.  The amendments to this rule will establish that a home initially financed by and granted exemption because of tax exempt bond financing will retain the same set-aside requirements for low-income residents if they refinance the original bond issue.  The rule must take effect on January 1, 1999, the date upon which 1999 tax assessments are made, to ensure that no further unintended consequences result from the current rule.

December 30, 1998 Claire Hesselholt Rules Manager Legislation and Policy Division OTS-2632.1 AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 95-06-041, filed 2/24/95, effective 3/27/95) WAC 458-16A-010 Nonprofit homes for the aging. (1)  Introduction.   Under  RCW 84.36.041 , a nonprofit home for the aging may be totally or partially exempt from property tax.  This section explains the exemptions allowed and the criteria that must be met in order to receive an exemption under this statute.  Throughout this section, all requirements will pertain to all types of homes for the aging including, but not limited to, adult care homes, assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities (CCRC), and independent housing, unless a particular type of home is separately identified. (2)  Definitions.   For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: (a) ""Acquisition"" means that an existing home for the aging (or home) currently in operation is acquired by a nonprofit organization and the ownership of the facility will change as a result of a purchase, gift, foreclosure, or other method. (b) ""Assistance with activities of daily living"" means the home provides, brokers, or contracts for the provision of auxiliary services to residents, such as meal and housekeeping service, transportation, ambulatory service, and attendant care including, but not limited to, bathing and other acts related to personal hygiene, dressing, shopping, food preparation, monitoring of medication, and laundry services. (c) ""Combined disposable income"" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of his or her spouse, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or his or her spouse or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. (i) If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding calendar year, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person during the months the person was retired by twelve. (ii) If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding calendar year (( by reason ))  because  of the death of the person's spouse, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person after the death of the spouse by twelve. (d) ""Complete and separate dwelling units"" means that the individual units of a home contain complete facilities for living, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation. (e) ""Construction"" means the actual construction or building of all or a portion of a home that did not exist prior to the construction.

(g) ""Continuing care contract"" means a contract to provide a person, for the duration of that person's life or for a term in excess of one year, shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services, that is conditioned upon the transfer of property, the payment of an entrance fee to the provider of the services, and/or the payment of periodic charges in consideration for the care and services provided.  A continuing care contract is not excluded from this definition because the contract is mutually terminable or because shelter and services are not provided at the same location. (h) ""Cotenant"" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident. (i) ""Disposable income"" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended prior to January 1, 1994, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income: (i) Capital gains, other than nonrecognized gain on the sale of a principal residence under section 1034 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, or gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal Internal Revenue Code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence; (ii) Amounts deducted for loss; (iii) Amounts deducted for depreciation; (iv) Pension and annuity receipts; (v) Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vi) Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vii) Federal Social Security Act and railroad retirement benefits; (viii) Dividend receipts; and (ix) Interest received on state and municipal bonds. (j) ""Eligible resident"" means a person who: (i) Occupied the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of January 1st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed.  The exemption will not be nullified if the eligible resident is confined to a hospital or nursing home and the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or occupied by a spouse, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both; (ii) Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of physical disability.  A surviving spouse of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify for this exemption if the surviving spouse is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and (iii) Has a combined disposable income that is no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as determined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the county in which the person resides and in effect as of January 1 of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (k) ""Home for the aging"" or ""home"" means a residential housing facility that: (i) Provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) Has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) Provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. (l) ""HUD"" means the federal Department of Housing and Urban  Development. (m) ""Local median income"" means the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect on January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (n) ""Low income"" means that the combined disposable income of a resident is eighty percent or less of the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect as of January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted. (o) ""Occupied dwelling unit"" means a living unit that is occupied on January 1st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed. (p) ""Property that is reasonably necessary"" means all property that is: (i) Operated and used by a home; and (ii) The use of which is restricted to residents, guests, or employees of a home. (q) ""Refinancing"" means the discharge of an existing debt with funds obtained through the creation of new debt.  For purposes of this section, even if the application for tax exempt bond financing to refinance existing debt is treated by the financing agent as something other than refinancing, an application for a property tax exemption because of refinancing by tax exempt bonds will be treated as refinancing and the set-asides specific to refinancing will be applied.  ""Refinancing"" shall include tax exempt bond financing in excess of the amount of existing debt that is obtained to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge a facility currently being operated as a home. (r) ""Rehabilitation"" means that an existing building or structure, not currently used as a home, will be modified, improved, restored, extended, or enlarged so that it will be used as a home for elderly and disabled individuals.  A project will be considered a rehabilitation if the costs of rehabilitation exceed five thousand dollars.  If a home has acquired tax exempt bond financing and does not meet the definition of ""rehabilitation"" contained in this subsection, the home may be eligible for a total exemption under the ""refinancing"" definition and if it meets the ""refinancing"" set-aside requirements.  If such a home is not eligible for a total exemption, the department will determine the home's eligibility for a partial exemption in accordance with the pertinent parts of  RCW 84.36.041  and this section. (s) ""Set-aside(s)"" means the percentage of dwelling units reserved for low-income residents when the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a financing program using tax exempt bonds. (t) ""Shared dwelling units"" or ""shared units"" means individual dwelling units of a home that do not contain complete facilities for living, eating, cooking, and sanitation. (u) ""Taxable value"" means the value of the home upon which the tax rate is applied in order to determine the amount of property taxes due. (v) ""Total amount financed"" means the total amount of financing required by the home to fund construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, or refinancing.  Seventy-five percent of this amount must be supplied by tax exempt bonds to receive the total exemption from property tax available under the tax exempt bond financing provision of  RCW 84.36.041 . (3)  General requirements.   To be exempt under this section, a home for the aging must be: (a) Exclusively used for the purposes for which exemption is granted, except as provided in  RCW 84.36.805 ; (b) Operated by an organization that is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code; and (c) The benefit of the exemption must inure to the home. (4)  Total exemption.   There are three ways in which a home may be totally exempt from property tax.  All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt if it meets the general requirements listed in subsection (3) of this section and: (a) At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents; (b) The home is subsidized under a HUD program; or (c) The construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents.  See subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this section for tax exempt bond requirements and the percentage of units that must be set-aside for low-income residents in order for the home to be totally exempt. (5)  Homes or CCRCs financed by tax exempt bonds--Generally.   All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home or CCRC may be totally exempt from property tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed for construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home or CCRC to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents. (a) The percentage of set-aside units required will vary depending on whether the home is a CCRC, the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained, the type of dwelling unit, and the receipt of Medicaid funds.  The set-aside requirements for homes are set forth in subsection (6) of this section and for CCRCs are set forth in subsection (7) of this section. (b) The exemption will be granted in direct correlation between the total amount financed by tax exempt bonds and the portion of the home or CCRC that is constructed, acquired, rehabilitated, or refinanced by tax exempt bonds. (c) If tax exempt bonds are used for refinancing, the set-aside requirements set forth in subsections (6) and (7) of this section will be applied to the actual area or portion of the home or CCRC to which the bonds correspond. (i) Example 1.  A CCRC (that accepts Medicaid funds) is composed of a multistory building, six duplexes, and two independent homes and the CCRC has secured tax exempt bonds to satisfy an existing mortgage on the multistory building.  Only the multistory building will be considered eligible for a total exemption from property tax because of tax exempt bond financing. To receive the exemption, at least twenty percent of the dwelling units of the multistory building must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income or at least forty percent of the dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. (ii) Example 2.  A home obtains tax exempt bonds to refinance a portion of the home and to fund construction.  The department will separately consider the area of the home that corresponds to the purpose for which the tax exempt bonds were obtained.  The set-aside requirements related to refinancing will be applied to the portion of the home that corresponds to the mortgage being refinanced and the set-aside requirements related to construction will be applied to the area of the home to be newly constructed.  The department will determine the eligibility for partial exemption of the remainder of the home that is not being refinanced or constructed. (d) If a total exemption is granted under the tax exempt bond financing provision, the total exemption will remain in effect as long as: (i) The home or CCRC remains in compliance with the requirements under which it received the tax exempt bonds; (ii) The tax exempt bonds are outstanding; and (iii) The set-aside requirements are met. (e) If a home or CCRC has obtained tax exempt bond financing to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge its existing facility and the project does not meet the definition of rehabilitation contained in subsection (2) of this section, the project will not be considered a rehabilitation and the set-aside requirements related to refinancing or acquisition will be applied in determining eligibility for a total exemption. (f) When a home or CCRC no longer meets the criteria for exemption under the tax exempt bond financing portion of the statute, eligibility for exemption under  RCW 84.34.041  will be determined by the other provisions of the statute.  In other words, a home may receive a total or partial exemption depending on the number of residents who are deemed to be ""eligible residents"" or who require ""assistance with activities of daily living.""  For example, if a home that previously received a total exemption due to the receipt of tax exempt bond financing has one hundred dwelling units and sixty of those dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive a total exemption. (6)  Set-aside requirements related to homes and tax exempt bond financing.   A specified number of dwelling units within a home must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for homes will be determined according to the type of dwelling units contained in the home and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to CCRCs.  The specific set-aside requirements for CCRCs are described in subsection (7) of this section. (( (a) Complete and separate dwelling units - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a home with any complete and separate units, the following set-asides will apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. (b) Complete and separate dwelling units - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire or refinance a home with any complete and separate units, the following set-asides will apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. (c) Shared dwelling units - construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing.  If financing was obtained for the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home with only shared units, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. ))  A home must meet the following set-aside requirements to be totally exempt from property tax: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING TYPE OF DWELLING UNIT SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation Complete  Separate units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units   currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements Complete  Separate units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements Complete  Separate units 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income Acquisition, New Construction, Refinancing,  or  Rehabilitation Shared units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income (7)  Set-aside requirements related to CCRCs and tax exempt bond financing.    A specified number of dwelling units of a CCRC must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for CCRCs will be determined by whether the CCRC does or does not have Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to other homes.  The specific set-aside requirements for other homes are described in subsection (6) of this section. (a) The continuing care contract between the resident and the CCRC is a contract to provide shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services to the resident for the duration of the resident's life or for a term in excess of one year.  A resident's tenancy may not be terminated due to inability of the resident to fully pay the monthly service fee when the resident establishes facts to justify a waiver or reduction of these charges.  This provision shall not apply if the resident, without the CCRC's consent, has impaired his and/or her ability to meet financial obligations required by the continuing care contract due to a transfer of assets, after signing the continuing care contract, other than to meet ordinary and customary living expenses, or by incurring unusual or unnecessary new financial obligations. (b) A CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents may not receive Medicaid funds from Washington state or the federal government during the term that the bonds are outstanding, except during the initial transition period as allowed by state law or if the regulatory agreement with the tax exempt bond financier exempts the CCRC from compliance with this requirement. (c)  The following set-aside requirements must be met by  CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) (( - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Fifteen percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below one hundred percent of the local median income. (d) CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire a CCRC or to refinance a CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. ))  to receive a total exemption: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income (( (e) ))  (d) The following set-aside requirements must be met by  CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds((  - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a CCRC with Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. (f) CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire a CCRC or to refinance a CCRC with Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. ))  to receive a total exemption: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income  (8)  Partial exemption.   If a home does not qualify for a total exemption from property tax, the home may receive a partial exemption for its real property on a unit by unit basis and a total exemption for its personal property. (a) Real property exemption.  If the real property of a home is used in the following ways, the portion of the real property so used will be exempt and the home may receive a partial exemption for: (i) Each dwelling unit occupied by a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living; (ii) Each dwelling unit occupied by an eligible resident; and  (iii) Common or shared areas of the home that are jointly used for two or more purposes that are exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW . (b) Assistance with activities of daily living.  A home may receive a partial exemption for each dwelling unit that is occupied by a resident who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and the home provides, brokers, facilitates, or contracts for the provision of this assistance.  A resident requiring assistance with the activities of daily living must be a resident who requires significant assistance with at least three of the nonexclusive list of activities set forth below and who, unless he or she receives the assistance, would be at risk of being placed in a nursing home.  Activities of daily living include, but are not limited to: (i) Shopping; (ii) Meal and/or food preparation; (iii) Housekeeping; (iv) Transportation; (v) Dressing; (vi) Bathing; (vii) General personal hygiene; (viii) Monitoring of medication;  (ix) Ambulatory services; (x) Laundry services; (xi) Incontinence management; and (xii) Cuing for the cognitively impaired. (c) Examples of assistance with the activities of daily living: (i) If the resident of a home requires someone to assist him or her with daily dressing, bathing, and personal hygiene, weekly housekeeping chores, and daily meal preparation, he or she is a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living and the home may receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit in which he or she resides. (ii) If the resident of a CCRC only requires someone to clean his or her house weekly and to do the laundry weekly, the resident does not require significant assistance with activities of daily living and the CCRC may not receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit. (d) Common or shared areas.  Areas of a home that are jointly used for two or more purposes exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW  will be exempted under  RCW 84.36.041 . (i) The joint use of the common or shared areas must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  A kitchen, dining room, and laundry room are examples of the types of common or shared areas for which a partial property tax exemption may be granted.  (ii) Example.  A nonprofit organization uses its facility as a home for the aging and a nursing home.  The home and nursing home jointly use the kitchen and dining room.  The home may receive a property tax exemption for the common or shared areas under  RCW 84.36.041 .  The eligibility of the other areas of the facility will be determined by the appropriate statute.  The home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.040 . (e) Amount of partial exemption.  The amount of partial exemption will be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, minus/less the assessed value of any common or shared areas, by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction is the number of the dwelling units occupied on January 1st of the assessment year by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living.  The denominator of the fraction is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of January 1st of the assessment year.  Example: Assessed value of home: $500,000 Less assessed value of common area:   - 80,000 Total $420,000 Number of units occupied on 1/1 by  eligible residents and people requiring assistance with daily living activities =  Total of occupied units on 1/1  6 40 or .15 $420,000 x .15= $63,000  Amount of partial exemption $420,000 - $63,000= $357,000  Taxable value of home (f) Valuation of the home.  The assessor will value a home that receives a partial exemption by considering only the current use of the property during the period in which the partial exemption is received and will not consider any potential use of the property. (9)  Income verification required from some residents.   If a home seeks a total property tax exemption because at least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents or seeks to receive a partial exemption based upon the number of units occupied by eligible residents, the residents must submit income verification forms.  The department may request income verification forms from residents of homes receiving a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing. (a) The income verification forms must be submitted to the assessor of the county in which the home is located by July 1st of the assessment year in which the application for exemption is made. (b) The income verification form will be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. (c) If an eligible resident filed an income verification form for a previous year, he or she is not required to submit a new form unless there is a change in status affecting the resident's eligibility, such as a significant increase or decrease in disposable income, or the assessor or the department requests a new income verification form to be submitted. (10) (( Three-year phase in for a home with increased taxable value.   If the taxable value of a home is increased because of the change in the method of calculating the amount of partial exemption, the increased taxable value shall be phased in over a period of three years. (a) Eligibility requirements for phase in.  If the home meets the following conditions the increased taxable value may be phased in: (i) The home was exempt or partially exempt for taxes levied in 1993 for collection in 1994; (ii) The home is partially exempt for taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995; and (iii) The taxable value of the home increased for taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995 due to the change prescribed by chapter 151, Laws of 1993 with respect to the numerator of the fraction used to determine the amount of partial exemption. (b) Method of phase in.  The increase in taxable value shall be phased in as follows: Column 1 Year Column 2 Value after partial exemption Column 3 Increase in Value (Col. 2 minus TV from Prior Year) Column 4 Annual % of Increase  to be Paid Column 5 Amount of Increase to be Paid (Col. 3 x Col 4) Column 6 Taxable Value (""TV"") (Col. 5 +TV from Prior Year) 1993 $292,300      $292,300 1994 $357,000*  $64,700 33.00% $21,351 $313,651 1995 $336,000** $22,349 50.00% $11,175 $324,826 1996 $325,500   $674    100.00%  $674     $325,500 1997 $367,500      $367,500 * This value is a continuation of the example in subsection (8)(e) of this section. ** For the purposes of this example, we are assuming that the home is located in a county on a four year revaluation cycle and that value of this home after the partial exemption will fluctuate each year because the number of eligible residents and residents who require assistance with the activities of daily living will change each year.  In this example, the number of units exempt from property tax within the home used in the example in subsection (8)(e) are as follows:  Eight in 1995, nine in 1996, and five in 1997. (i) For taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995, the home will pay taxes based on the taxable value in 1993 plus one-third of the increase in the taxable value from 1993 to the taxable value calculated under subsection (8)(e) of this section. (ii) For taxes levied in 1995 for collection in 1996, the home will pay taxes based on the taxable value in 1994 plus one-half of the increase in the taxable value from 1994 to the taxable value calculated under subsection (8)(e) of this section. (iii) For taxes levied in 1996 for collection in 1997 and for taxes levied thereafter, this subsection does not apply and the home will pay taxes on the taxable value without reference to this subsection. (c) Example:  Assume, for the purposes of this example, in 1993 the assessed value of a home was $475,000, the value of the shared area was $80,000, and twenty-six percent of the units were exempt.  Therefore, the assessed value minus the value of the shared area or $395,000 multiplied by .74= a taxable value of $292,300. (11) ))  Additional requirements.   Any nonprofit home for the aging that applies for a property tax exemption under this section must also comply with the provisions of  WAC 458-16A-020  and 458-16-165.   WAC 458-16A-020  contains information regarding the initial application and renewal procedures relating to the exemption discussed in this section.   WAC 458-16-165  sets forth additional requirements that must be complied with to obtain a property tax exemption pursuant to  RCW 84.36.041 .

Purpose:  This rule explains the basis and requirements for the property tax exemption, both partial and total, available to homes for the aging under RCW 84.36.041.     Citation of Existing Rules Affected by this Order:  Amending WAC 458-16A-010 Nonprofit homes for the aging.     Statutory Authority for Adoption:  RCW 84.36.041 and 84.36.865.     Under RCW 34.05.350 the agency for good cause finds that immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest.     Reasons for this Finding:  The amendments address the concerns of the Washington Association of Housing and Services for the Aging and the unintended results of the current set-aside requirements in the current rule.  When the current rule was adopted in 1995, the participants in the rule-making process failed to consider that a brand new facility financed with exempt bonds, which initially met the low income set-aside requirements, might need to refinance these bonds because of interest rate changes or market growth.  If such a facility is required to meet the higher set-aside requirements for low-income residents regarding refinancing contained in the current rule, the facility may lose its capacity to serve low-income residents because it may either lose its tax exempt status or ability to refinance.  The amendments to this rule will establish that a home initially financed by and granted exemption because of tax exempt bond financing will retain the same set-aside requirements for low-income residents if they refinance the original bond issue.  The rule must take effect on January 1, 1999, the date upon which 1999 tax assessments are made, to ensure that no further unintended consequences result from the current rule.

(1)  Introduction.   Under RCW 84.36.041, a nonprofit home for the aging may be totally or partially exempt from property tax.  This section explains the exemptions allowed and the criteria that must be met in order to receive an exemption under this statute.  Throughout this section, all requirements will pertain to all types of homes for the aging including, but not limited to, adult care homes, assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities (CCRC), and independent housing, unless a particular type of home is separately identified.     (2)  Definitions.   For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:     (a) ""Acquisition"" means that an existing home for the aging (or home) currently in operation is acquired by a nonprofit organization and the ownership of the facility will change as a result of a purchase, gift, foreclosure, or other method.     (b) ""Assistance with activities of daily living"" means the home provides, brokers, or contracts for the provision of auxiliary services to residents, such as meal and housekeeping service, transportation, ambulatory service, and attendant care including, but not limited to, bathing and other acts related to personal hygiene, dressing, shopping, food preparation, monitoring of medication, and laundry services.     (c) ""Combined disposable income"" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of his or her spouse, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or his or her spouse or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home.     (i) If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding calendar year, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person during the months the person was retired by twelve.     (ii) If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding calendar year (( by reason ))  because  of the death of the person's spouse, the combined disposable income of the person will be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of the person after the death of the spouse by twelve.     (d) ""Complete and separate dwelling units"" means that the individual units of a home contain complete facilities for living, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation.     (e) ""Construction"" means the actual construction or building of all or a portion of a home that did not exist prior to the construction.     (f) ""Continuing care retirement community"" or ""CCRC"" means an entity that provides shelter and services under continuing care contracts with its residents or includes a health care facility or health service.     (g) ""Continuing care contract"" means a contract to provide a person, for the duration of that person's life or for a term in excess of one year, shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services, that is conditioned upon the transfer of property, the payment of an entrance fee to the provider of the services, and/or the payment of periodic charges in consideration for the care and services provided.  A continuing care contract is not excluded from this definition because the contract is mutually terminable or because shelter and services are not provided at the same location.     (h) ""Cotenant"" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident.     (i) ""Disposable income"" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended prior to January 1, 1994, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income:     (i) Capital gains, other than nonrecognized gain on the sale of a principal residence under section 1034 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, or gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal Internal Revenue Code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence;     (ii) Amounts deducted for loss;     (iii) Amounts deducted for depreciation;     (iv) Pension and annuity receipts;     (v) Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments;     (vi) Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments;     (vii) Federal Social Security Act and railroad retirement benefits;     (viii) Dividend receipts; and     (ix) Interest received on state and municipal bonds.      (j) ""Eligible resident"" means a person who:     (i) Occupied the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of January 1st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed.  The exemption will not be nullified if the eligible resident is confined to a hospital or nursing home and the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or occupied by a spouse, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both;     (ii) Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of physical disability.  A surviving spouse of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify for this exemption if the surviving spouse is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and     (iii) Has a combined disposable income that is no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as determined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the county in which the person resides and in effect as of January 1 of the year the application for exemption is submitted.     (k) ""Home for the aging"" or ""home"" means a residential housing facility that:     (i) Provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person;     (ii) Has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and     (iii) Provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal.     (l) ""HUD"" means the federal Department of Housing and Urban  Development.     (m) ""Local median income"" means the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect on January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted.     (n) ""Low income"" means that the combined disposable income of a resident is eighty percent or less of the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by HUD for the county in which the home is located and in effect as of January 1st of the year the application for exemption is submitted.     (o) ""Occupied dwelling unit"" means a living unit that is occupied on January 1st of the year in which the claim for exemption is filed.     (p) ""Property that is reasonably necessary"" means all property that is:     (i) Operated and used by a home; and     (ii) The use of which is restricted to residents, guests, or employees of a home.     (q) ""Refinancing"" means the discharge of an existing debt with funds obtained through the creation of new debt.  For purposes of this section, even if the application for tax exempt bond financing to refinance existing debt is treated by the financing agent as something other than refinancing, an application for a property tax exemption because of refinancing by tax exempt bonds will be treated as refinancing and the set-asides specific to refinancing will be applied.  ""Refinancing"" shall include tax exempt bond financing in excess of the amount of existing debt that is obtained to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge a facility currently being operated as a home.     (r) ""Rehabilitation"" means that an existing building or structure, not currently used as a home, will be modified, improved, restored, extended, or enlarged so that it will be used as a home for elderly and disabled individuals.  A project will be considered a rehabilitation if the costs of rehabilitation exceed five thousand dollars.  If a home has acquired tax exempt bond financing and does not meet the definition of ""rehabilitation"" contained in this subsection, the home may be eligible for a total exemption under the ""refinancing"" definition and if it meets the ""refinancing"" set-aside requirements.  If such a home is not eligible for a total exemption, the department will determine the home's eligibility for a partial exemption in accordance with the pertinent parts of RCW 84.36.041 and this section.     (s) ""Set-aside(s)"" means the percentage of dwelling units reserved for low-income residents when the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a financing program using tax exempt bonds.     (t) ""Shared dwelling units"" or ""shared units"" means individual dwelling units of a home that do not contain complete facilities for living, eating, cooking, and sanitation.     (u) ""Taxable value"" means the value of the home upon which the tax rate is applied in order to determine the amount of property taxes due.     (v) ""Total amount financed"" means the total amount of financing required by the home to fund construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, or refinancing.  Seventy-five percent of this amount must be supplied by tax exempt bonds to receive the total exemption from property tax available under the tax exempt bond financing provision of RCW 84.36.041.     (3)  General requirements.   To be exempt under this section, a home for the aging must be:     (a) Exclusively used for the purposes for which exemption is granted, except as provided in RCW 84.36.805;     (b) Operated by an organization that is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code; and     (c) The benefit of the exemption must inure to the home.     (4)  Total exemption.   There are three ways in which a home may be totally exempt from property tax.  All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt if it meets the general requirements listed in subsection (3) of this section and:     (a) At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents;     (b) The home is subsidized under a HUD program; or     (c) The construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents.  See subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this section for tax exempt bond requirements and the percentage of units that must be set-aside for low-income residents in order for the home to be totally exempt.     (5)  Homes or CCRCs financed by tax exempt bonds--Generally.   All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home or CCRC may be totally exempt from property tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed for construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home or CCRC to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents.     (a) The percentage of set-aside units required will vary depending on whether the home is a CCRC, the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained, the type of dwelling unit, and the receipt of Medicaid funds.  The set-aside requirements for homes are set forth in subsection (6) of this section and for CCRCs are set forth in subsection (7) of this section.     (b) The exemption will be granted in direct correlation between the total amount financed by tax exempt bonds and the portion of the home or CCRC that is constructed, acquired, rehabilitated, or refinanced by tax exempt bonds.     (c) If tax exempt bonds are used for refinancing, the set-aside requirements set forth in subsections (6) and (7) of this section will be applied to the actual area or portion of the home or CCRC to which the bonds correspond.     (i) Example 1.  A CCRC (that accepts Medicaid funds) is composed of a multistory building, six duplexes, and two independent homes and the CCRC has secured tax exempt bonds to satisfy an existing mortgage on the multistory building.  Only the multistory building will be considered eligible for a total exemption from property tax because of tax exempt bond financing. To receive the exemption, at least twenty percent of the dwelling units of the multistory building must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income or at least forty percent of the dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income.     (ii) Example 2.  A home obtains tax exempt bonds to refinance a portion of the home and to fund construction.  The department will separately consider the area of the home that corresponds to the purpose for which the tax exempt bonds were obtained.  The set-aside requirements related to refinancing will be applied to the portion of the home that corresponds to the mortgage being refinanced and the set-aside requirements related to construction will be applied to the area of the home to be newly constructed.  The department will determine the eligibility for partial exemption of the remainder of the home that is not being refinanced or constructed.     (d) If a total exemption is granted under the tax exempt bond financing provision, the total exemption will remain in effect as long as:     (i) The home or CCRC remains in compliance with the requirements under which it received the tax exempt bonds;     (ii) The tax exempt bonds are outstanding; and     (iii) The set-aside requirements are met.     (e) If a home or CCRC has obtained tax exempt bond financing to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge its existing facility and the project does not meet the definition of rehabilitation contained in subsection (2) of this section, the project will not be considered a rehabilitation and the set-aside requirements related to refinancing or acquisition will be applied in determining eligibility for a total exemption.     (f) When a home or CCRC no longer meets the criteria for exemption under the tax exempt bond financing portion of the statute, eligibility for exemption under RCW 84.34.041 will be determined by the other provisions of the statute.  In other words, a home may receive a total or partial exemption depending on the number of residents who are deemed to be ""eligible residents"" or who require ""assistance with activities of daily living.""  For example, if a home that previously received a total exemption due to the receipt of tax exempt bond financing has one hundred dwelling units and sixty of those dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive a total exemption.     (6)  Set-aside requirements related to homes and tax exempt bond financing.   A specified number of dwelling units within a home must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for homes will be determined according to the type of dwelling units contained in the home and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to CCRCs.  The specific set-aside requirements for CCRCs are described in subsection (7) of this section.     (( (a) Complete and separate dwelling units - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a home with any complete and separate units, the following set-asides will apply:      (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and      (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income.      (b) Complete and separate dwelling units - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire or refinance a home with any complete and separate units, the following set-asides will apply:      (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or      (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income.      (c) Shared dwelling units - construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing.  If financing was obtained for the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home with only shared units, the following set-asides apply:      (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and      (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. ))  A home must meet the following set-aside requirements to be totally exempt from property tax:        purpose of bond financing   type of dwelling unit   set-aside requirements   New construction  or  Rehabilitation   Complete & Separate units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income   Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units   currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   Complete & Separate units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income   Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   Complete & Separate units   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income   Acquisition, New Construction, Refinancing,  or  Rehabilitation   Shared units   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income       (7)  Set-aside requirements related to CCRCs and tax exempt bond financing.    A specified number of dwelling units of a CCRC must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for CCRCs will be determined by whether the CCRC does or does not have Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to other homes.  The specific set-aside requirements for other homes are described in subsection (6) of this section.     (a) The continuing care contract between the resident and the CCRC is a contract to provide shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services to the resident for the duration of the resident's life or for a term in excess of one year.  A resident's tenancy may not be terminated due to inability of the resident to fully pay the monthly service fee when the resident establishes facts to justify a waiver or reduction of these charges.  This provision shall not apply if the resident, without the CCRC's consent, has impaired his and/or her ability to meet financial obligations required by the continuing care contract due to a transfer of assets, after signing the continuing care contract, other than to meet ordinary and customary living expenses, or by incurring unusual or unnecessary new financial obligations.     (b) A CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents may not receive Medicaid funds from Washington state or the federal government during the term that the bonds are outstanding, except during the initial transition period as allowed by state law or if the regulatory agreement with the tax exempt bond financier exempts the CCRC from compliance with this requirement.     (c)  The following set-aside requirements must be met by  CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) (( - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply:      (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and      (ii) Fifteen percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below one hundred percent of the local median income.      (d) CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire a CCRC or to refinance a CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply:      (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or      (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. ))  to receive a total exemption:        purpose of bond financing   set-aside requirements   New construction  or  Rehabilitation     10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income   Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income   Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income       (( (e) ))  (d) The following set-aside requirements must be met by  CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds((  - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a CCRC with Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply:      (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and      (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income.      (f) CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire a CCRC or to refinance a CCRC with Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply:      (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or      (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. ))  to receive a total exemption:        purpose of bond financing   set-aside requirements   New construction  or  Rehabilitation   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income   Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income   Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements   20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income        (8)  Partial exemption.   If a home does not qualify for a total exemption from property tax, the home may receive a partial exemption for its real property on a unit by unit basis and a total exemption for its personal property.     (a) Real property exemption.  If the real property of a home is used in the following ways, the portion of the real property so used will be exempt and the home may receive a partial exemption for:     (i) Each dwelling unit occupied by a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living;     (ii) Each dwelling unit occupied by an eligible resident; and      (iii) Common or shared areas of the home that are jointly used for two or more purposes that are exempt from property tax under chapter 84.36 RCW.     (b) Assistance with activities of daily living.  A home may receive a partial exemption for each dwelling unit that is occupied by a resident who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and the home provides, brokers, facilitates, or contracts for the provision of this assistance.  A resident requiring assistance with the activities of daily living must be a resident who requires significant assistance with at least three of the nonexclusive list of activities set forth below and who, unless he or she receives the assistance, would be at risk of being placed in a nursing home.  Activities of daily living include, but are not limited to:     (i) Shopping;     (ii) Meal and/or food preparation;     (iii) Housekeeping;     (iv) Transportation;     (v) Dressing;     (vi) Bathing;     (vii) General personal hygiene;     (viii) Monitoring of medication;      (ix) Ambulatory services;     (x) Laundry services;     (xi) Incontinence management; and     (xii) Cuing for the cognitively impaired.     (c) Examples of assistance with the activities of daily living:     (i) If the resident of a home requires someone to assist him or her with daily dressing, bathing, and personal hygiene, weekly housekeeping chores, and daily meal preparation, he or she is a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living and the home may receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit in which he or she resides.     (ii) If the resident of a CCRC only requires someone to clean his or her house weekly and to do the laundry weekly, the resident does not require significant assistance with activities of daily living and the CCRC may not receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit.     (d) Common or shared areas.  Areas of a home that are jointly used for two or more purposes exempt from property tax under chapter 84.36 RCW will be exempted under RCW 84.36.041.     (i) The joint use of the common or shared areas must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property tax under chapter 84.36 RCW.  A kitchen, dining room, and laundry room are examples of the types of common or shared areas for which a partial property tax exemption may be granted.      (ii) Example.  A nonprofit organization uses its facility as a home for the aging and a nursing home.  The home and nursing home jointly use the kitchen and dining room.  The home may receive a property tax exemption for the common or shared areas under RCW 84.36.041.  The eligibility of the other areas of the facility will be determined by the appropriate statute.  The home's eligibility will be determined by RCW 84.36.041 and the nursing home's eligibility will be determined by RCW 84.36.040.     (e) Amount of partial exemption.  The amount of partial exemption will be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, minus/less the assessed value of any common or shared areas, by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction is the number of the dwelling units occupied on January 1st of the assessment year by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living.  The denominator of the fraction is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of January 1st of the assessment year.  Example:          Assessed value of home:   $500,000     Less assessed value of common area:     - 80,000     Total   $420,000       Number of units occupied on 1/1 by     eligible residents and people requiring    assistance with daily living activities  . =     Total of occupied units on 1/1      6    40 or .15       $420,000 x .15 . = $63,000  Amount of partial exemption     $420,000 - $63,000 . = $357,000  Taxable value of home       (f) Valuation of the home.  The assessor will value a home that receives a partial exemption by considering only the current use of the property during the period in which the partial exemption is received and will not consider any potential use of the property.     (9)  Income verification required from some residents.   If a home seeks a total property tax exemption because at least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents or seeks to receive a partial exemption based upon the number of units occupied by eligible residents, the residents must submit income verification forms.  The department may request income verification forms from residents of homes receiving a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.     (a) The income verification forms must be submitted to the assessor of the county in which the home is located by July 1st of the assessment year in which the application for exemption is made.     (b) The income verification form will be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue.     (c) If an eligible resident filed an income verification form for a previous year, he or she is not required to submit a new form unless there is a change in status affecting the resident's eligibility, such as a significant increase or decrease in disposable income, or the assessor or the department requests a new income verification form to be submitted.     (10) (( Three-year phase in for a home with increased taxable value.   If the taxable value of a home is increased because of the change in the method of calculating the amount of partial exemption, the increased taxable value shall be phased in over a period of three years.      (a) Eligibility requirements for phase in.  If the home meets the following conditions the increased taxable value may be phased in:      (i) The home was exempt or partially exempt for taxes levied in 1993 for collection in 1994;      (ii) The home is partially exempt for taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995; and      (iii) The taxable value of the home increased for taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995 due to the change prescribed by chapter 151, Laws of 1993 with respect to the numerator of the fraction used to determine the amount of partial exemption.      (b) Method of phase in.  The increase in taxable value shall be phased in as follows:          Column 1    Year   Column 2    Value after    partial    exemption   Column 3    Increase in    Value (Col. 2    minus TV from    Prior Year)   Column 4    Annual % of    Increase     to be    Paid   Column 5    Amount of    Increase to be    Paid (Col. 3 x    Col 4)   Column 6    Taxable Value    (""TV"") (Col. 5    . +TV from    Prior Year)                       1993   $292,300     --   --   --   $292,300       1994   $357,000 . *    $64,700   33.00%   $21,351   $313,651       1995   $336,000 . * . *   $22,349   50.00%   $11,175   $324,826       1996   $325,500     $674      100.00%    $674       $325,500       1997   $367,500     --   --   --   $367,500           . *   This value is a continuation of the example in subsection (8)(e) of this section.        . * . *   For the purposes of this example, we are assuming that the home is located in a county on a four year revaluation cycle and that value of this home after the partial exemption will fluctuate each year because the number of eligible residents and residents who require assistance with the activities of daily living will change each year.  In this example, the number of units exempt from property tax within the home used in the example in subsection (8)(e) are as follows:  Eight in 1995, nine in 1996, and five in 1997.        (i) For taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995, the home will pay taxes based on the taxable value in 1993 plus one-third of the increase in the taxable value from 1993 to the taxable value calculated under subsection (8)(e) of this section.      (ii) For taxes levied in 1995 for collection in 1996, the home will pay taxes based on the taxable value in 1994 plus one-half of the increase in the taxable value from 1994 to the taxable value calculated under subsection (8)(e) of this section.      (iii) For taxes levied in 1996 for collection in 1997 and for taxes levied thereafter, this subsection does not apply and the home will pay taxes on the taxable value without reference to this subsection.      (c) Example:  Assume, for the purposes of this example, in 1993 the assessed value of a home was $475,000, the value of the shared area was $80,000, and twenty-six percent of the units were exempt.  Therefore, the assessed value minus the value of the shared area or $395,000 multiplied by .74 . = a taxable value of $292,300.      (11) ))  Additional requirements.   Any nonprofit home for the aging that applies for a property tax exemption under this section must also comply with the provisions of WAC 458-16A-020 and 458-16-165.  WAC 458-16A-020 contains information regarding the initial application and renewal procedures relating to the exemption discussed in this section.  WAC 458-16-165 sets forth additional requirements that must be complied with to obtain a property tax exemption pursuant to RCW 84.36.041.

(1) The Department of Safety's driver point system is designed to identify those drivers whose records reflect a continuous disrespect for traffic laws, and a disregard for the safety of other persons on the highways. To administer this program, a point value will be assessed for each accident and moving violation conviction. Upon receipt of a moving traffic conviction notice from any court, or the receipt, by the Department, of an accident report indicating the person contributed to the occurrence of the accident, the Department shall charge the driver's record points as set out herein. Convictions of moving traffic violations which occurred more than one (1) year prior to the Department's receipt shall not be used within this program.  (2) (3)  Authority: T.C.A. 55-50-505.

Repeal and new rule filed August 5, 1996; effective December 27, 1996. 1340-1-4-.04 SUSPENSION OF LICENSE FOR MOVING VIOLATION CONVICTIONS OR CONTRIBUTING TO THE OCCURRENCE OF AN ACCIDENT. (1) An advisory letter shall be mailed to each driver that accumulates six (6) or more, but less than twelve (12) points within a one (1) year period. The letter shall inform the driver of the point system and advise the driver of the points that he has accumulated and the consequences of accumulating more points. A driver shall receive only one (1) advisory letter of caution within a five (5) year period. When a driver has accumulated twelve (12) or more points within a one (1) year period, the Department of Safety shall issue a notice of proposed suspension stating the grounds for such suspension and provide the driver with notice of his or her right to request an administrative hearing, provided the driver's request for the hearing is received within twenty (20) days from the date of notice in writing and stating why the proposed action should not occur. Upon receipt of a timely request for a hearing, the Department shall afford the driver a hearing before a hearing officer. Proposed suspension action may also be initiated toward those drivers who are deemed to be accident prone. A driver is deemed to be accident prone when a periodic review of his or her driving record reveals three (3) or more avoidable accidents within a one (1) year period. The determination of whether an accident is avoidable or unavoidable rests with the Department. Failure to request a hearing in writing pursuant to this chapter shall result in a six (6) month suspension unless the driver is currently undergoing, or has previously undergone within a five (5) year period, driver improvement suspension action, in which case the suspension period shall be for twelve (12) months.  (2)  (3)  (4)  November, 2001 (Revised)  4   TENNESSEE DRIVER IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (Rule 1340-1-4-.04, continued) (5)  CHAPTER 1340-1-4  When a driver offers valid proof that an error in record keeping has occurred, and when the correction of this error would lower his or her point accumulation to less than twelve (12), then the suspension action shall be withdrawn. When a driver requesting a hearing fails to establish proof that an error in the record keeping has occurred, then the suspension action shall stand. Calculation of Points - Each time a violation is posted to the driver's record, the computer shall scan back for a period of twelve (12) months from the posted date to determine whether sufficient points have been accumulated to warrant a proposed suspension notice. Any violations with an event date prior to the date of completion of the defensive driving course shall be included in the first entry into the Driver Improvement Program. Any violations with an event date subsequent to the date of completion of the defensive driving course shall be calculated as violation of probation. Violations posted subsequent to the date of completion of the course but which occurred prior to the date of completion of the course shall not be grounds for violation of probation. First Offenders (a) (b) Any driver not suspended entering the Driver Improvement Program who has not been involved in the program within a five (5) year period shall be treated as a first offender. A notice of proposed suspension shall be issued to first offender drivers who accumulate between twelve (12) and twenty-four (24) points within a twelve (12) month period. The twelve (12) month period shall be calculated retroactively from the date each violation is posted. This notice shall advise the driver that he/she has accumulated sufficient points in a twelve (12) month period to placed in the Driver Improvement Program; that he/she has the right to request an administrative hearing in writing to contest the proposed suspension if such hearing is requested within (20) days from the date of the notice; and that he/she is eligible as a first offender to elect to waive their right to request a hearing and to be assigned directly into a defensive driving course in lieu of suspension. Upon receipt of a timely request for an Administrative hearing, the Department shall afford the driver a hearing before a hearing officer. Persons entering the Driver Improvement Program for the first time with more than twelve (12) accumulated points, but less than twenty-five (25) points, who choose to be assigned directly into a defensive driving course in lieu of a six (6) month suspension will expressly waive their right to an administrative hearing by making this selection. They shall be sent a letter advising them of the location, address and telephone number of approved schools, and instructions for compliance. First offenders who accumulate more than twenty-four (24) points within a twelve (12) month period shall not be offered the option to waive their right to an administrative hearing and be assigned directly into a defensive driving course. In the event such offenders request an administrative hearing in writing, they may be assigned to attend a defensive driving course in lieu of suspension at the hearing officer's discretion. Upon receipt of a request for an administrative hearing, the Department shall afford the driver a hearing before a hearing officer. Following completion of the course and notification to the Department, the offender shall be placed on probation for a period of twelve (12) months. Any violations with an event date subsequent to the date of completion of the defensive driving course shall be considered a violation of probation.  (6)  (7)  (c)  (d)  (e)  November, 2001 (Revised)  5   TENNESSEE DRIVER IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (Rule 1340-1-4-.04, continued) (f)  CHAPTER 1340-1-4  Violation of Probation - The first offense posted to the record of a driver on probation shall not trigger any departmental action for violation of probation, but a warning letter shall be generated to the driver which advises him/her that an offense or accident has been posted to the record of the driver during the probation period and any further violations within the probationary period shall constitute a violation of probation and revocation of probation and suspension for six (6) months shall occur. A second offense posted to the record of a driver on probation will trigger violation of probation and suspension action. If revocation of probation and suspension is proposed by the Department, the driver shall be advised in writing that he/she has the right to request an administrative hearing within twenty (20) days from the date of the notice before a safety hearing officer to contest the probation violation and suspension. Upon receipt of a request for an administrative hearing, the Department shall afford the driver a hearing before a hearing officer. At the discretion of the Department, an offender under driver improvement suspension may be issued a restricted license. The Department may place conditions on the license as the Department may determine to be appropriate to insure the safe operation of a motor vehicle by the person. To obtain a restricted license, the driver must complete an application, furnish proof of liability insurance, pay the restricted driver license fee and pass the driver license examination. A driver may be issued only one (1) restricted license in a five (5) year period. Administrative Probation - For good cause or in extreme circumstances, the Department may place a first offender driver on administrative probation in lieu of suspension. In this event, no suspension of the license shall occur, the probation period shall be for twelve (12) months, and the driver shall carry his or her points during this time. Good cause or extreme circumstances may include, but not be limited to, drivers temporarily out of the state or country due to military, employment, educational reasons, or serious illness. Violation of administrative probation shall follow the same procedure as violation of probation subsequent to the completion of a defensive driving school. Placement on administrative probation is a substitute for completion of a defensive driving course and a driver who violates administrative probation shall not be eligible to attend a defensive driving course.  (g)  (h)  (i)  (8)  Second or Subsequent Offenders (a) A notice of proposed suspension shall be issued to second or subsequent offenders who accumulate twelve (12) points within a twelve (12) month period. The notice shall advise those offenders that they have accumulated sufficient points in a twelve (12) month period to have their license suspended for a period of six (6) months and are entitled to request an administrative hearing in writing in order to contest the proposed suspension if such hearing is requested within twenty (20) days of the date of the notice. Upon receipt of a request for an administrative hearing, the Department shall afford the driver a hearing before a hearing officer. Persons who accumulate twelve (12) points within a twelve (12) month period and have attended a defensive driving course in lieu of suspension within the previous five (5) year period shall have their license suspended for a period of six (6) months. A driver entering the Driver Improvement Program for a second or subsequent time who has previously attended a defensive driving course in lieu of suspension within the previous five (5) period, and who is currently undergoing, or has previously undergone within the five (5) year period, driver improvement suspension action, shall have his/her driving privileges suspended for twelve (12) months.  (b)  (c)  November, 2001 (Revised)  6   TENNESSEE DRIVER IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (Rule 1340-1-4-.04, continued) (d)  CHAPTER 1340-1-4  A driver entering the Driver Improvement program for a second or subsequent time, but has not attended a defensive driving course previously within the five (5) year period may be offered the option to attend such course in lieu of suspension at the hearing officer's discretion. An eligible driver who elects to attend a defensive driving course in lieu of suspension shall be given ninety (90) days from the date of the letter assigning them to attend a course, or ninety (90) days from the date of their hearing to complete a defensive driving course. Failure to complete the defensive driving course as assigned shall result in the suspension of the driver's license for six (6) months. Request for an extension of time to attend the course made in writing within ten (10) days of the running of the ninety (90) day period may be considered by the Department on a case-by-case basis for good cause. The Department shall notify the driver of the decision in writing. If no certificate of completion has been received by the Department of Safety within seventyfive (75) days from the date of being assigned to attend a course, a warning letter shall be issued to the driver advising them that they were assigned to complete the defensive driving course to avoid suspension action, that no proof of completion has been received, and that failure to comply immediately shall result in the suspension of their driving privileges for six (6) months.  (e)  (f)  (g)  (9)  An administrative hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer upon request of a driver. The hearing officer will explain the Driver Improvement Program, review the driving record in question, and advise the driver of his options, i.e., whether he/she is eligible to attend a defensive driving course in lieu of suspension.  (10) Any driver whose license is suspended under this program by the hearing officer is eligible to appeal this action through the appeals process contained in the Administrative Procedures Act. (T.C.A. 45-101 et seq.) (11) Reinstatement (a) Provided there is no other revocation, suspension, or cancellation action in effect, a driver will be eligible to regain his driving privileges once he has served the period of suspension, paid a restoration fee, filed evidence with the Department of financial responsibility for the future and passed the driver license examination. A suspended driver who failed to attend the defensive driving school as assigned may be permitted to reinstate prior to his/her eligibility date upon furnishing proof to the Department of attendance and completion of a departmentally-approved defensive driving course provided for above. A list of all Departmentally approved defensive driving courses shall be provided to the driver. Said driver shall be required to comply with all reinstatement requirements provided in this chapter. In this event, upon furnishing documentation of completion of the defensive driving course, the driver shall be placed on probation for twelve (12) months and all conditions of probation shall apply.  (b)  Authority: T.C.A. 55-50-502, 55-50-505, 55-50-331, 55-50-322, 55-12-119, and 55-12-129. Administrative History: Repeal and new rule filed March 12, 1986; effective June 14, 1986.

(1) Mental Standards (a) Any person who has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction or has been evaluated by a psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health facility and found to be afflicted with or suffering from any mental disease or disease including substance abuse, may have his/her driving privileges suspended until such time as they have been restored to competency by court order, order from the superintendent of the mental facility, or other such method provided by law, and must apply through the Driver Improvement Unit to receive a clearance/reinstatement order in order to recover, retain or obtain their driving privileges. If the applicant claims to have been restored to competency, a certified copy of the court order or written statement from a psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health facility must first be mailed directly to the Driver Improvement Unit for approval. On approval, the applicant will receive a clearance/reinstatement order from the Driver Improvement Unit. Court orders from persons who say they have been, or who are reported to have been, afflicted with mental illness or chronic substance abuse, regardless of whether evidence of cures are presented, must be forwarded to the Driver Improvement Unit with particulars for approval.  (b)  (c) (d)  (2)  Physical Standards (a) In all cases where medical statements are needed, the complaint/data must first be reviewed by the Department. Drivers who may be physically unfit to operate a motor vehicle upon the streets or highways of Tennessee may be identified in the following manner, and the review process invoked: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

No action will be taken until the conclusion of the investigation or hearing, and any action at such time will be determined by the results of the investigation or hearing. (c) There the review process is invoked, persons reported to have a medical problem shall be notified in writing and the Department shall provide the appropriate medical statement forms and instructions to each person for the review process. The medical statements must be completed by a licensed physician and should contain sufficient information regarding the person's medical condition as to enable the Department to determine whether the person should be permitted to retain or obtain his/her driving privileges. The physician shall be requested to provide an opinion about the person's ability to drive. Said opinion will be given consideration in conjunction with other available information, and is not binding on the Department in making a decision. Those medical forms completed by the physician will be reviewed and one or more of the following actions will apply: 1. If the physician documents that the person does not have a medical problem relating to the operation of a motor vehicle, the case may be closed. If the case is not closed it may be referred to the Medical Review Board, to reconcile differences in complaint and doctor's statement. If the physician cannot positively document that the person does not have a medical condition relating to the operation of a motor vehicle, or if the physician feels that the person should not be allowed to drive for medical reasons, or if the Department so chooses, the medical papers may be forwarded to a Medical Review Board. The Medical Review Board may recommend the suspension of the drivers license and the conditions for the suspension. The Commissioner of Safety is empowered to implement the recommendation of the Medical Review Board, subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act.  (d)  (e)  2.  3.  (f) (g)  The Department may require the driver to submit to a special driver license examination in lieu of, or in addition to, the medical review process. Persons who fail to furnish the Department with the required medical information will have their driving privileges suspended until such time as a favorable medical report is received and restoration of driving privileges is approved. The Department may utilize independent medical review boards to review and makes recommendations in cases of persons with mental or physical conditions. The review boards will be made up of licensed physicians, in fields of specialized or generalized medicine. Physicians may serve on the medical review board in a voluntary capacity, may be reimbursed as deemed appropriate by the Department on a per-case basis. The recommendations of the review board shall not be binding upon the Department. It is the policy of the Department not to license anyone who suffers from uncontrolled epilepsy (also known as a seizure disorder), momentary lapses of consciousness or control due to epilepsy, cardiac syncope, diabetes, or other conditions, until he/she has remained seizure-free or lapse free for a period of one (1) year, and then only upon receipt of a favorable medical statement from his physician. Provided, however, the person may be approved for driving privileges after having been controlled for six (6) months, upon receipt of such a favorable  (h)  (i)  November, 2001 (Revised)  10   TENNESSEE DRIVER IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (Rule 1340-1-4-.06, continued)  CHAPTER 1340-1-4  recommendation from his/her physician, approval of the Medical Review Board, and approval of the Department. (j) The medical statement must contain the following information: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. (k) The cause of the seizures, lapses, blackouts, or loss of consciousness or control; The frequency of the seizures, lapses, blackouts, or loss of consciousness or control; The medication taken, if any and effects the medication will have on the person's ability to drive; The person's compliance with treatment and/or medication; The physician's recommendation toward licensing.  In the following cases, the person may be immediately suspended until he submits the medical statement containing the information mentioned above: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. A history of seizures is admitted by the person; Information is submitted by a medical authority; Information is submitted by someone of a reputable nature who has witnessed a seizure; Information from relatives or friends who know the condition. Data obtained from courts, individuals, or information that would appear to be reliably obtained through other sources.  (l)  The policy outlined above also applies to other physical or mental disabilities where the Department has good cause to believe the subject would not be able to operate a motor vehicle with safety upon Tennessee highways because of lapses of consciousness of control. Persons who have physical disabilities that can be compensated for by the use of physical controls or mechanical devices which enable the applicant to safely operate a motor vehicle may be approved for licensing if they meet all other appropriate eligibility criteria. Applicants who are hearing impaired shall be restricted to the operation of vehicles equipped with left and right outside rear-view mirrors. Vision standards, including telescopic/bioptic lens use by drivers with low vision, are located in the rules of the Driver License Issuance Division of the Department of Safety. Any person may request an administrative hearing before a hearing officer within twenty (20) days from the date of notification of the proposed suspension action. Any aggrieved party who has their driving privileges suspended as a result of a physical or mental disability may appeal the decision of the Department by filing a petition pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act.

Such notice shall also inform the driver that he/she may request an administrative hearing within twenty (20) days from the date of the notice. The Department shall take action as may be appropriate and may suspend the license of such person or permit such driver to retain such license. Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to such re-examination shall be grounds for suspension of the driver's license. Period re-examinations may be required, such as once a year, in the case or physical or mental conditions, or where there is a deterioration of the visual acuity or motor nerve response. A driver required to undergo re-examination by the Department may undertake the written and/or vision portion of the driver examination test without limitation. A driver required to undergo re-examination by the Department may take the on-the-road skills portion of the driver examination test three times at thirty day intervals. If successful, their driving privileges shall be reinstated. If unable to pass a road test in three attempts, the driver shall not be eligible to re-test for six (6) months from the date of the third test. Drivers with a commercial drivers license may be required to submit to re-examination in their commercial vehicle or school bus. If the driver fails the re-examination in their commercial vehicle or school bus but wishes to downgrade to a Class D license, they may do so after successfully passing a complete examination in their personal vehicle. Drivers who fail to submit to re-examination as required, or who fail to pass the re-examination, or who do not ask for an administrative hearing shall have their driving privileges suspended until such time as they comply with the re-examination requirement. Any driver required by the Department to undergo re-examination shall be notified that he/she may request an administrative hearing before a representative of the Department, provided such request is submitted within twenty (20) days after date of notice. Upon receipt of a request for an administrative hearing, the Department shall afford the driver a hearing before a hearing officer.

Subd. 2.  [IMMUNITY FROM  LIABILITY.]  The receiver and the receiver's employees  shall have official immunity and shall be immune from suit and liability, both  personally and in their official capacities, for a claim for damage to or loss  of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or resulting  from an alleged act, error, or omission of the receiver or an employee arising  out of or by reason of their duties or employment. Nothing in this subdivision  shall be construed to hold the receiver or an employee immune from suit or  liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or  willful and wanton misconduct of the receiver or an employee.    Subd. 3.  [INDEMNIFICATION.]  If a legal action is commenced against the receiver or any  employee, whether against the receiver or employee personally or in their  official capacity, alleging property damage, property loss, personal injury, or  other civil liability caused by or resulting from an alleged act, error, or  omission of the receiver or an employee arising out of or by reason of their  duties or employment, the receiver and employee must be indemnified from the  assets of the insurer for all expenses, attorneys' fees, judgments, settlements,  decrees, or amounts due and owing or paid in satisfaction or incurred in the  defense of the legal action unless it is determined upon a final adjudication on  the merits that the alleged act, error, or omission of the receiver or employee  giving rise to the claim did not arise out of or by reason of the receiver's or  employee's duties or employment, or was caused by intentional or willful and  wanton misconduct.    (a) Attorney's fees and related  expenses incurred in defending a legal action for which immunity or indemnity is  available under this section must be paid from the assets of the insurer, as  they are incurred, in advance of the final disposition of the action upon  receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the receiver or employee to repay  the attorneys' fees and expenses if it is ultimately determined upon a final  adjudication on the merits that the receiver or employee is not entitled to  immunity or indemnity under this section.    (b) Indemnification for expense  payments, judgments, settlements, decrees, attorneys' fees, surety bond  premiums, or other amounts paid or to be paid from the insurer's assets  according to this section is an administrative expense of the insurer.    (c) In the event of an actual or  threatened litigation against a receiver or an employee for which immunity or  indemnity may be available under this section, a reasonable amount of funds  which in the judgment of the commissioner may be needed to provide immunity or  indemnity must be segregated and reserved from the assets of the insurer as  security for the payment       Journal of the House - 22nd  Day - Top of Page 624      of indemnity until all applicable statutes of limitation  have run and all actual or threatened actions against the receiver or an  employee have been completely and finally resolved, and all obligations of the  insurer and the commissioner under this section have been satisfied.    (d) In lieu of segregation and  reserving of funds, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion,  obtain a surety bond or make other arrangements that will enable the  commissioner to fully secure the payment of all obligations under this  section.    Subd. 4.  [SETTLEMENT  COVERAGE.]  If a legal action against an employee for  which indemnity may be available under this section is settled before final  adjudication on the merits, the insurer must pay the settlement amount on behalf  of the employee, or indemnify the employee for the settlement amount, unless the  commissioner determines:    (1) that the claim did not arise  out of or by reason of the employee's duties or employment; or    (2) that the claim was caused by  the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of the employee.    Subd. 5.  [SETTLEMENT  APPROVAL.]  In a legal action in which the receiver is a  defendant, that portion of a settlement relating to the alleged act, error, or  omission of the receiver is subject to the approval of the court before which  the delinquency proceeding is pending. The court shall not approve that portion  of the settlement if it determines:    (1) that the claim did not arise  out of or by reason of the receiver's duties or employment; or    (2) that the claim was caused by  the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of the receiver.    Subd. 6.  [CONSTRUCTION.]  Nothing contained or implied in this section operates, or  shall be construed or applied, to deprive the receiver or an employee of  immunity, indemnity, benefits of law, rights, or any defense otherwise  available.    Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 60B.21,  subdivision 2, is amended to read:   Subd. 2. [FIXING OF RIGHTS.] Upon issuance of the order,  the rights and liabilities of any such insurer and of its creditors,  policyholders, shareholders, members, and all other persons interested in its  estate are fixed as of the date of filing of the petition for liquidation,  except as provided in sections 60B.22 , 60B.25, clause  (22),  and 60B.39.

Subject to the court's  control, the liquidator may:   (1) Appoint a special deputy to act under sections 60B.01  to 60B.61 and determine the deputy's compensation.

(4) Defray all expenses of taking possession of,  conserving, conducting, liquidating, disposing of, or otherwise dealing with the  business and property of the insurer.

Any amounts so paid shall be deemed expense of  administration and shall be repaid for the credit of the department of commerce  out of the first available money of the insurer.       Journal of the House - 22nd  Day - Top of Page 625      (5) Hold hearings, subpoena witnesses and compel their  attendance, administer oaths, examine any person under oath and compel any  person to subscribe to testimony after it has been correctly reduced to writing,  and in connection therewith require the production of any books, papers,  records, or other documents which the liquidator deems relevant to the inquiry.   (6) Collect all debts and money due and claims belonging  to the insurer, wherever located, and for this purpose institute timely action  in other jurisdictions, in order to forestall garnishment and attachment  proceedings against such debts; do such other acts as are necessary or expedient  to collect, conserve, or protect its assets or property, including sell,  compound, compromise, or assign for purposes of collection, upon such terms and  conditions as the liquidator deems best, any bad or doubtful debts; and pursue  any creditor's remedies available to enforce claims.   (7) Conduct public and private sales of the property of  the insurer in a manner prescribed by the court.

(9) Acquire, hypothecate, encumber, lease, improve, sell,  transfer, abandon, or otherwise dispose of or deal with any property of the  insurer at its market value or upon such terms and conditions as are fair and  reasonable, except that no transaction involving property the market value of  which exceeds $10,000 shall be concluded without express permission of the  court. The liquidator may also execute, acknowledge, and deliver any deeds,  assignments, releases, and other instruments necessary or proper to effectuate  any sale of property or other transaction in connection with the liquidation. In  cases where real property sold by the liquidator is located other than in the  county where the liquidation is pending, the liquidator shall cause to be filed  with the county recorder for the county in which the property is located a  certified copy of the order of appointment.   (10) Borrow money on the security of the insurer's assets  or without security and execute and deliver all documents necessary to that  transaction for the purpose of facilitating the liquidation.

If the insurer is dissolved  under section 60B.23, the liquidator may apply to any court in this state or  elsewhere for leave to be substituted for the insurer as plaintiff.   (13) Prosecute any action which may exist in behalf of  the creditors, members, policyholders, or shareholders of the insurer against  any officer of the insurer, or any other person.   (14) Remove any records and property of the insurer to  the offices of the commissioner or to such other place as is convenient for the  purposes of efficient and orderly execution of the liquidation.

(18) Assert all defenses available to the insurer as  against third persons, including statutes of limitations, statutes of frauds,  and the defense of usury. A waiver of any defense by the insurer after a  petition for liquidation has been filed shall not bind the liquidator.   (19) Exercise and enforce all the rights, remedies, and  powers of any creditor, shareholder, policyholder, or member, including any  power to avoid any transfer or lien that may be given by law and that is not  included within sections 60B.30 and 60B.32.

(22)   (23)  Exercise all powers now held or hereafter conferred  upon receivers by the laws of this state not inconsistent with sections 60B.01  to 60B.61.

Transferees of coverage obligations or provider contracts shall  have no liability to creditors or obligees of the health maintenance  organization except those liabilities expressly assumed.   Sec. 30. [60B.365] [REINSURER'S LIABILITY.]   Subdivision 1.  [GENERALLY.]  The amount recoverable by the liquidator from reinsurers  must not be reduced as a result of the delinquency proceedings, regardless of  any provision in the reinsurance contract or other agreement.    Subd. 2.  [REQUIRED CONTRACT  PROVISIONS.]  All reinsurance contracts to which an  insurer domiciled in this state is a ceding party that do not contain the  following provisions required with respect to the obligation of reinsurers in  the event of insolvency of the reinsured in order to obtain credit for  reinsurance or other applicable statutes, must be construed to contain the  following provisions:    (1) in the event of insolvency and  the appointment of a receiver, the reinsurance obligation is payable to the  receiver, with reasonable provision for verification, without diminution because  of the insolvency or because the receiver has failed to pay all or a portion of  any claims. Payments by the reinsurer must be made directly to the ceding  insurer or to its receiver; and    (2) the receiver of a reinsured  company shall give written notice of the pendency of a claim against the  reinsured company indicating the policy or bond reinsured, within a reasonable  time after the claim is filed. The receiver of a reinsured company may arrange  for the giving of notice of the pendency of claims on reinsured policies by  guaranty funds or by other persons responsible for the adjustment and settlement  of the reinsured company's claims. Failure to give notice does not excuse the  obligation of the reinsurer unless it is substantially prejudiced by the failure  of the receiver to give notice. The reinsurer may interpose, at its own expense,  in the proceeding where the claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses  that it may consider available to the reinsured company or its receiver.    Subd. 3.  [PAYMENTS.]  Payments by the reinsurer must be made directly to the  ceding insurer or its receiver, except where the contract of insurance or  reinsurance specifically provides for another payee for the reinsurance in the  event of insolvency of the ceding insurer according to the applicable  requirements of statutes, rules, or orders of the domiciliary state of the  ceding insurer. The receiver and the reinsurer are entitled to recover from a  person who unsuccessfully makes a claim directly against the reinsurer the  receiver's attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in preventing any collection by  the person.

[LOSS CLAIMS; INCLUDING CLAIMS NOT COVERED BY A  GUARANTY ASSOCIATION.] All claims under policies or contracts of coverage for  losses incurred including third party claims, and all claims against the insurer  for liability for bodily injury or for injury to or destruction of tangible  property which are not under policies or contracts. All claims under life  insurance and annuity policies, whether for death proceeds, annuity proceeds, or  investment values, shall be treated as loss claims. That portion of any loss for  which indemnification is provided by other benefits or advantages recovered or  recoverable by the claimant shall not be included in this class, other than  benefits or advantages recovered or recoverable in discharge of familial  obligations of support or by way of succession at death or as proceeds of life  insurance, or as gratuities. No payment made by an employer to an employee shall  be treated as a gratuity. Claims not covered by a guaranty association are loss  claims.  If any portion of a claim is covered by a  reinsurance treaty or similar contractual obligation, that claim shall be  entitled to a pro rata share, based upon the relationship the claim amount bears  to all claims payable under the treaty or contract, of the proceeds received  under that treaty or contractual obligation.    Claims receiving pro rata payments  shall not, as to any remaining unpaid portion of their claim, be treated in a  different manner than if no such payment had been received.    Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 60B.44, is  amended by adding a subdivision to read:   Subd. 4a.  [FEDERAL CLAIMS.]  Claims of the federal government.    Sec. 34.

Officers are not entitled to the benefit of this priority. In cases  where there are no claims and no potential claims of the federal government in  the estate, these claims will have priority over claims in subdivision 4.    (b) The priority in paragraph (a)  is in lieu of any other similar priority authorized by law as to wages or  compensation of employees.    Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 60B.44,  subdivision 6, is amended to read:   Subd. 6. [RESIDUAL CLASSIFICATION.] All other claims  including claims of  the federal or  any state or local  government, not falling within other classes under this section. Claims,  including those of any governmental body for a penalty or forfeiture, shall be  allowed in this class only to the extent of the pecuniary loss sustained from  the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture  arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby.

(b) The insurer shall notify the commissioner within five  business days following declaration of a dividend declared pursuant to paragraph  (a) and at least ten days prior to its payment. The commissioner shall promptly  consider the notification filed pursuant to this paragraph, taking into  consideration the factors described in subdivision 4.   (c) The commissioner shall review at least annually the  dividends paid by an insurer pursuant to paragraph (a) for the purpose of  determining if the dividends are reasonable based upon (1) the adequacy of the  level of surplus as regards policyholders remaining after the dividend payments,  and (2) the quality of the insurer's earnings and extent to which the reported  earnings include extraordinary items, such as surplus relief reinsurance  transactions and reserve destrengthening.   (d) No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary  dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:  (1) 30 days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration of it  and has not within the period disapproved the payment; or (2) the commissioner  has approved the payment within the 30-day period.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an  insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is  conditional upon the commissioner's approval, and the declaration shall confer  no rights upon shareholders until: (1) the commissioner has approved the payment  of such a dividend or distribution; or (2) the commissioner has not disapproved  the payment within the 30-day period referred to above.   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 60K.02,  subdivision 1, is amended to read:   Subdivision 1. [REQUIREMENT.] No person shall act or  assume to act as an insurance agent in the solicitation or procurement of  applications for insurance, nor in the sale of insurance or policies of  insurance, nor in any manner aid as an insurance agent in the negotiation of  insurance by or with an insurer, including resident agents or reciprocal or  interinsurance exchanges and fraternal benefit societies, until that person  obtains from the commissioner a license for that purpose.

(b) The commissioner shall subject each applicant who is  a natural person to a written examination as to the applicant's competence to  act as an insurance agent. The examination must be held at a reasonable time and  place designated by the commissioner.   (c) The examination shall be approved for use by the  commissioner and shall test the applicant's knowledge of the lines of insurance,  policies, and transactions to be handled under the class of license applied for,  of the duties and responsibilities of the licensee, and pertinent insurance laws  of this state.   (d) The examination shall be given only after the  applicant has completed a program of classroom studies in a school, which shall  not include a school sponsored by, offered by, or affiliated with an insurance  company or its agents; except that this limitation does not preclude a bona fide  professional association of agents, not acting on behalf of an insurer, from  offering courses. The course of study shall consist of 30 hours of classroom  study devoted to the basic fundamentals of insurance for those seeking a  Minnesota license for the first time , ; three hours devoted to state laws, regulations, and rules  applicable to the line or lines of insurance for which licensure is being  applied;  15 hours devoted to specific life and health topics for those  seeking a life and health license , ;  and 15 hours devoted to specific property and casualty  topics for those seeking a property and casualty license. The program of studies  or study course shall have been approved by the commissioner in order to qualify  under this paragraph. If the applicant has been previously licensed for the  particular line of insurance in the state of Minnesota, the requirement of a  program of studies or a study course shall be waived. A certification of  compliance by the organization offering the course shall accompany the  applicant's license application. This program of studies in a school or a study  course shall not apply to farm property perils and farm liability applicants, or  to agents writing such other lines of insurance as the commissioner may exempt  from examination by order.   (e) The applicant must pass the examination with a grade  determined by the commissioner to indicate satisfactory knowledge and  understanding of the class or classes of insurance for which the applicant seeks  qualification. The commissioner shall inform the applicant as to whether or not  the applicant has passed.  Examination results are valid  for a period of three years from the date of the examination.

Examination fees for subsequent examinations  shall not be waived.   (g) Any applicant for a license covering the same class  or classes of insurance for which the applicant was licensed under a similar  license in this state, other than a temporary license, within the three years  preceding the date of the application shall be exempt from the requirement of a  written examination, unless the previous license was revoked or suspended by the  commissioner. An applicant whose license is not renewed under section 60K.12 is  exempt from the requirement of a written examination.   Sec. 39.

[NONRESIDENT AGENT.] The commissioner shall  issue a nonresident insurance agent's license to a qualified person who is a  resident of another state or country as follows:   (a) A person may qualify for a license under this section  as a nonresident only if that person holds a license in another state, province  of Canada, or other foreign country which, in the opinion of the commissioner,  qualifies that person for the same activity as that for which a license is  sought.   (b) The commissioner shall not issue a license to a  nonresident applicant until that person files with the commissioner a  designation of the commissioner and the commissioner's successors in office as  the applicant's true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful  process in an action, suit, or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of an  interested person arising out of the applicant's insurance business in this  state. This designation constitutes an agreement that this service of process is  of the same legal force and validity as personal service of process in this  state upon that applicant.       Journal of the House - 22nd  Day - Top of Page 630      Service of process upon a licensee in an action or  proceeding begun in a court of competent jurisdiction of this state may be made  in compliance with section 45.028, subdivision 2.

[CRITERIA FOR COURSE ACCREDITATION.] (a) The  commissioner may accredit a course only to the extent it is designed to impart  substantive and procedural knowledge of the insurance field. The burden of  demonstrating that the course satisfies this requirement is on the individual or  organization seeking accreditation. The commissioner shall approve any  educational program approved by Minnesota Continuing Legal Education relating to  the insurance field. The commissioner is authorized to establish a procedure for  renewal of course accreditation.   (b) The commissioner shall approve or disapprove  professional designation examinations that are recommended for approval by the  advisory task force.

[OPTIONAL PROVISIONS.] Except as provided in  subdivision 4, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in  this state shall contain provisions respecting the matters set forth below  unless such provisions are in the words in which the same appear in this  section. The insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of any such provision a       Journal of the House - 22nd  Day - Top of Page 637      corresponding provision of different wording approved by  the commissioner which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or  the beneficiary. Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded  individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this subdivision or, at the  option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or  subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.   (1) A provision as follows:   CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or  contract sickness after having changed occupations to one classified by the  insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for  compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer  will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the  premiums paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by  the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes  occupations to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated  in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation  will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro rata  unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy  anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the  more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk  and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior  to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date  of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of  insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was  issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of  occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by  the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the  date of proof of change of occupation.   (2) A provision as follows:   MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been  misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium  paid would have purchased at the correct age.   (3) A provision as follows:   OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or  sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the  insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate  indemnity for ..... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $.....  (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be  void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned to the insured or  to the insured's estate, or, in lieu thereof:   Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under  a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy  elected by the insured, or the insured's beneficiary or estate, as the case may  be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.   (4) A provision as follows:   INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid  coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a  provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this  insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or  commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage of  this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which would  otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under  all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had  notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss,  and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro  rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of applying this  provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the ""like  amount"" of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services  rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.   If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy  which also contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to  the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase ""EXPENSE INCURRED BENEFITS.""  The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of ""other  valid coverage,"" approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall  be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to  regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other  state of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical        Journal of the House - 22nd  Day - Top of Page 638      service organizations, and to any other coverage the  inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner. In the absence of such  definition such term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical  payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service  organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit  organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with  respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant  to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or  employer's liability statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or  otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be ""other valid coverage"" of which the  insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third  party liability coverage shall be included as ""other valid coverage.""   (5) A provision as follows:   INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid  coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other  than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given  written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only  liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of  the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like  indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under  this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and  for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata  portion for the indemnities thus determined.   If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy  which also contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to  the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase -- ""OTHER BENEFITS."" The  insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of ""other  valid coverage,"" approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall  be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to  regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other  state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage  the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner. In the absence of  such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits  provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit  organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with  respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant  to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or  employer's liability statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or  otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be ""other valid coverage"" of which the  insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third  party liability coverage shall be included as ""other valid coverage.""   (6) A provision as follows:   RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly  amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss  of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis,  shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability  commenced or the insured's average monthly earnings for the period of two years  immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the  greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such  benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such  average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly  benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time  such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid  during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for  the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the  total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the  insured below the sum of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in  such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits  other than those payable for loss of time.   The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a  policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms  by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or, (2) in the case  of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.

In the event  of cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any  premium paid.

[ SUPPLEMENT TO ANNUAL  STATEMENTS   SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS .] Each insurer  that has fixed indemnity policies in force in this state shall,  as a supplement to the annual statement required by section  60A.13   upon request by the commissioner , submit,  in a form prescribed by the commissioner,  the   experience data  for the calendar year  showing its  incurred claims, earned premiums, incurred to earned loss ratio, and the ratio  of the actual loss ratio to the expected loss ratio for each fixed indemnity  policy form in force in Minnesota. The experience data must be provided on both  a Minnesota only and a national basis. If in the opinion of the company's  actuary, the deviation of the actual loss ratio from the expected loss ratio for  a policy form is due to unusual reserve fluctuations, economic conditions, or  other nonrecurring conditions, the insurer should also file that opinion with  appropriate justification.   If the data submitted does not confirm that the insurer  has satisfied the loss ratio requirements of this section, the commissioner  shall notify the insurer in writing of the deficiency. The insurer shall have 30  days from the date of receipt of the commissioner's notice to file amended rates  that comply with this section or a request for an exemption with appropriate  justification. If the insurer fails to file amended rates within the prescribed  time and the commissioner does not exempt the policy form from the need for a  rate revision, the commissioner shall order that the insurer's filed rates for  the nonconforming policy be reduced to an amount that would have resulted in a  loss ratio that complied with this section had it been in effect for the  reporting period of the supplement. The insurer's failure to file amended rates  within the specified time of the issuance of the commissioner's order amending  the rates does not preclude the insurer from filing an amendment of its rates at  a later time.

Virginia Water Protection Permit Regulation. The purpose of the proposed action is to amend the regulation to incorporate changes to  62.1-44.3, 62.1-44.5, 62.1-44.15, 62.1-44.15:5 and 62.1-44.29 of the Code of Virginia relating to wetlands as mandated by the 2000 General Assembly in Senate Bill 648 and House Bill 1170 and other changes that the department or the public deems necessary and are warranted. These changes are designed to clarify and streamline the permitting process and to establish and implement policies and programs to protect and enhance the Commonwealth's wetland resources, using a regulatory approach to achieve no net loss of wetlands and a voluntary approach to achieve a net resource gain. The board is seeking comments on the intended regulatory action, including ideas to assist in the revisions to the regulation. An informational public meeting will be held and notice of the meeting will be posted in the Calendar of Events section of the Virginia Register of Regulations. In addition, a Technical Advisory Committee has been formed to assist in the development of the regulation; notice of the meeting dates will be posted in the Calendar of Events section of the Virginia Register of Regulations.

General Virginia Water Permit for Wetland Impacts from Development Activities; 5. 9 VAC 25-700-10 et seq. General Virginia Water Permit for Wetland Impacts from Mining Activities; and 6. 9 VAC 25-710-10 et seq. General Virginia Water Permit for Wetland Restoration and Creation Activities. The purpose of the proposed action is to develop general permits for activities in wetlands as specified in changes to  62.1-44.15:5 of the Code of Virginia relating to wetlands as mandated by the General Assembly in Senate Bill 648 and House Bill 1170. The new regulations are needed to expedite and streamline the wetland permitting process in Virginia. Need: Pursuant to the actions of the 2000 General Assembly, Virginia Water Protection Permit General Permits are to be developed in accordance with changes to  62.1-44.15:5 of the Code of Virginia relating to wetlands. General permits are to be developed for such activities in wetlands as the board deems appropriate, and are to include such terms and conditions as the board deems necessary to protect state Monday, July 3, 2000   Notices of Intended Regulatory Action resources and fish and wildlife resources from significant impairment. The adoption of general permits for wetland impacts is essential to protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens because they will streamline the permitting process, allowing agencies and applicants to save time and money. Substance: The proposed regulatory action is to develop a series of Virginia Water Protection Permit General Permits in response to the requirements of new legislation. These general permits are for classes of similar activities with minimal environmental consequence. The board shall develop general permits for: 1. Activities causing wetland impacts of less than onehalf of an acre; 2. Facilities and activities of utilities and public service companies regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or State Corporation Commission; 3. Coal, natural gas, and coal bed methane gas mining activities authorized by the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, and for sand mining activities; 4. Virginia Department of Transportation or other linear transportation projects; and 5. Activities governed by nationwide or regional permits approved by the board and issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Conditions contained in the general permits shall include, but not be limited to, filing with the board copies of any preconstruction notification, postconstruction report and certificate of compliance required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The permits will contain specific thresholds for use and mitigation ratios for compensation for unavoidable wetland impacts. Alternatives: The alternative of not developing these general permits is not feasible as the proposed changes are mandated by action of the General Assembly. The alternative of developing these permits will clarify and streamline the permitting process and help alleviate duplicative requirements of state and federal programs. Public Participation: The board is seeking comments on the intended regulatory action, including ideas to assist in the development of general permits. An informational public meeting will be held and notice of the meeting posted in the Calendar of Events section of the Virginia Register of Regulations. In addition, a Technical Advisory Committee has been formed to assist in the development of the general permits; notice of the meeting dates will be posted in the Calendar of Events section of the Virginia Register of Regulations.

No. R00-211; Filed June 15, 2000, 12:01 p.m.  (See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: Section 58.1-439.9 of the Code of Virginia mandates the board to promulgate regulations for (i) establishing procedures for claiming the tax credit and (ii) providing for the allocation of tax credits among taxpayers requesting credits and employers claiming grants under the Virginia Targeted Tax Grant Program. The Virginia Employer Tax Credit is currently operating under the provisions of an emergency regulation. Purpose: The purpose of the regulation is to set forth procedures for employers to claim tax credits when they hire qualified TANF recipients. The purpose of the tax credit is to provide incentives to employers to hire TANF recipients who otherwise may not be considered for a position, thereby, maximizing employment opportunities that will lead to selfsufficiency. Substance: The regulation will set forth time frames for the submission of applications for the Virginia Employer Tax Credit (VETC) and the Virginia Targeted Job Grant (VTJG). Additionally, requirements for submission of applications for the respective programs as well as details on how funds will be allocated for the programs will be addressed. As set forth in the enacting legislation, the regulation must address the allocation of the funding between the VTJG and the VETC. The funding issue was created by the enacting legislation which tied funding for both programs to the appropriation for the VTJG. The regulation must describe how the appropriation will be allocated between the two programs. Issues: The primary advantage of implementing this regulation is the provision of a tax credit that will provide employers with incentives to hire recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. This regulation will benefit both the employer and the recipient. The advantages of this regulation to the public and the agency will be a reduction in the TANF caseload. Because of the block grant and maintenance of effort spending requirements, there will not be a direct impact on public assistance spending; however, the Commonwealth's TANF surplus may be indirectly impacted. Further, the public will benefit by the fact the former recipients will be productive, taxpaying citizens. The disadvantage to the agency is additional costs associated with administering the program. Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with  9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 13 (94). Section 9-6.14:7.1 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property. The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts.  w   w TITLE 22. SOCIAL SERVICES STATE BOARD OF SOCIAL SERVICES  Title of Regulation: 22 VAC 40-35-5 et seq.

Volume 16, Issue 21  Monday, July 3, 2000 2615   Proposed Regulations Summary of the proposed regulation. This amendment to the Virginia Independence Program (VIP) permanently implements the Virginia Employer Tax Credit, which was originally implemented through an emergency regulation on May 19, 1999. The Virginia Employer Tax Credit offers a tax credit not to exceed $750 to employers who hire qualified Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients. The Employer Tax Credit program, along with the Virginia Targeted Jobs Grant (VTJG), has been appropriated $375,000 each year through fiscal year 2000 for its implementation. Money not spent for tax credits or job grants reverts back to the general VIEW fund for use in other programs. Estimated economic impact. Current Literature The majority of recent literature on welfare-to-work strategies concentrates on overall initiatives rather than specific components, such as tax credit or job grant programs. One recent study of four state welfare-to-work strategies showed clear positive results in terms of employment and earnings gains for program participants.1 In addition, the resulting reductions in public assistance payments were large enough to offset program costs in two of the four programs, and in a third when impacts on other transfer payments (i.e., Medicaid payments, food stamps) were factored in. The programs that included more generous education and training components were more likely to have longer lasting impacts on recipient's self-sufficiency and income, although these programs generally cost more and, therefore, do not provide the same amount of short-run savings to government. Recent literature on tax credits and wage subsidies presents evidence that such policies often have low utilization rates.2 Data from the 1970s Work Incentive Tax Credit (WINTC) program indicates that no more than 20% of the workincentive program enrollees who were known to have entered employment during the year were claimed by firms as a tax credit.3 During the Job Opportunities in the Business Sector (JOBS) program in the late 1960s-early 1970s, the federal government offered contracts that would reimburse businesses an average of $3,200 per placement. Despite this relatively large hiring subsidy and much publicity, only one third of all businesses hiring JOBS eligible employees took advantage of the grant. Review of Employer Tax Credit Program to Date Implemented on May 19, 1999, as an emergency regulation, the Employer Tax Credit program has been in place for almost seven months [this analysis is dated December 21, 1999]. Although some businesses have expressed interest, no one has been placed through the Employer Tax Credit program to date.4 One possible reason why the Employer Tax Credit program is not currently being utilized may be that availability of a tax credit has not been aggressively marketed. Another possible explanation could be that the tax credit is not large enough to generate firm interest. Although the Employer Tax Credit program is not currently being used, it is still possible to evaluate its potential cost effectiveness. In spite of minimal administrative costs, the average cost per new job created may be greater than the tax credit amount of $750. There are two reasons for this. First, certain participants hired might have found jobs without the Employer Tax Credit program and, therefore, do not represent a net increase in employment. This is especially relevant since the tax credit program is open to all TANF recipients and a significant portion of that population has historically been able to return to the workforce without state assistance. The second reason the average cost per new job created may exceed the tax credit amount of $750 is that the program provides a subsidy for qualifying welfare recipients. The effect of such a subsidy will be to increase the demand for tax credit-eligible workers relative to other comparably skilled workers since the cost of hiring them is lower. If a tax crediteligible individual is hired in place of a noneligible worker then there is (again) no net gain in employment. The extent of such job displacement among nonqualifying workers will depend on the state of the labor market. In a tight labor market where jobs are plentiful and workers are scarce, a wage subsidy is more likely to create new jobs, although the possibility that the participants hired would have found work without the grant is higher. In a slack labor market where jobs are few and workers are plentiful, a wage subsidy will most likely result in substantial job displacement for nonqualifying workers as firms turn to ""cheaper"" labor. The most obvious benefits of successful placements resulting from the tax credits will be the savings in Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF) assistance and other related transfer payments. These savings will result from the increased incomes of participants and their earlier departure from the welfare rolls. Some individuals may also gain employment that provides health insurance benefits, decreasing state Medicaid expenditures. The community will benefit from the increase in productivity that results from the movement of individuals from the welfare rolls to the workforce. On the other hand, there are some potential costs associated with an individual's transition to the workforce. While the belief that most people prefer to be productive members of society is probably well-grounded, a single mother that must work long hours at a low-paying job while having to put her children in day care may believe that she was better off on welfare, especially if the available day care is perceived to be of a lower quality. A precise estimate of the cost effectiveness of this program would require the following information: 1  Friedlander, Daniel and Gary Burtless. 1995.

Did individuals hired with tax credit leave the TANF program earlier than they otherwise would have? 4. How many individuals hired with the tax credit subsequently returned to the welfare system? 5. What is the increased productivity to society of the employed worker (i.e., the value gained by society)? Because there is little data on any of these important factors, it is not possible to draw a conclusion about whether the benefits resulting from the tax credit program will outweigh the costs. Businesses and entities affected. The Virginia Employer Tax Credit (VTEC) offers a tax credit not to exceed $750 to employers who hire qualified Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients. In FY 1999, there was an average of 37,798 TANF recipients per month. This regulation will also positively affect businesses that take advantage of the wage subsidy. A firm will not hire additional workers unless there is some marginal benefit, however small it may be. This benefit to the firm may come in the form of higher profits or it may be derived from the contribution to the community or an enhanced reputation, but, in any case, the firm will expect to be better off. Localities particularly affected. This regulation is not expected to disproportionately affect any particular localities. Projected impact on employment. This program could potentially result in a net increase in employment for Virginia. As discussed previously, the extent of the increase would depend on the state of the labor market and whether the placements would have found jobs otherwise. In a slack labor market the potential for job displacements of noneligible workers is strong. Effects on the use and value of private property. This regulation is not expected to have any effect on the use and value of private property. Agency's Response to the Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Social Services concurs with the findings of the Department of Planning and Budget. Summary: The regulation sets forth procedures for employers to claim tax credits when they hire Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients as authorized by the passage of HB 696 during the 1998 session of the Virginia General Assembly. The tax credit provides incentives to employers to hire TANF recipients who otherwise may not be considered for an employment opportunity. 22 VAC 40-35-10. Definitions.

If the commissioner grants the waiver, the waterworks owner is not required to monitor. (c) The commissioner may grant a waiver based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) Potential asbestos contamination of the water source, and (ii) The use of asbestos-cement pipe for finished water distribution and the corrosive nature of the water. (d) A waiver remains in effect until the completion of the three-year compliance period. Waterworks not receiving a waiver shall monitor in accordance with the provisions of subdivision B 1 d (1)(a) of this section. (e) The owner of a waterworks vulnerable to asbestos contamination due solely to corrosion of asbestos-cement pipe shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe and under conditions where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur. (f) The owner of a waterworks vulnerable to asbestos contamination due solely to source water shall monitor sampling points in accordance with subdivision B 1 of this section. (g) The owner of a waterworks vulnerable to asbestos contamination due both to its source water supply and corrosion of asbestos-cement pipe shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe and under conditions where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur. (h) The owner of a waterworks which exceeds the PMCL as determined in 12 VAC 5-590-410 B 1 shall monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the violation occurred. (i) The commissioner may decrease the quarterly monitoring requirement to the frequency specified in subdivision B 1 d (1)(a) of this section provided the commissioner has determined that the waterworks is reliably and consistently below the PMCL. In no case can the commissioner make this determination unless the owner of a groundwater source waterworks takes a minimum of two quarterly samples or the owner of a waterworks which uses a surface water source in whole or in part takes a minimum of four quarterly samples. (j) If monitoring data collected after January 1, 1990, are generally consistent with the requirements of subdivision B 1 d (1) of this section, then the commissioner may allow waterworks owner to use that data to satisfy the Volume 16, Issue 21 2649 monitoring requirement for the initial compliance period beginning January 1, 1993. (2) The frequency of monitoring conducted to determine compliance with the PMCLs MCLs in Table 2.2 for barium, cadmium, chromium, fluoride, mercury, and selenium shall be as follows: (a) The owner of a groundwater source waterworks shall take one sample at each sampling point during each compliance period beginning in the compliance period starting January 1, 1993. (b) The owner of a waterworks which uses a surface water source in whole or in part shall take one sample annually at each sampling point beginning January 1, 1993. (c) A waterworks owner may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies specified in subdivision B 1 d (2) (a) or (b) of this section. (d) A condition of the waiver shall require that the waterworks owner shall take a minimum of one sample while the waiver is effective. The term during which the waiver is effective shall not exceed one compliance cycle (i.e., nine years). (e) The commissioner may grant a waiver provided the owner of a waterworks which uses a surface water source in whole or in part has monitored annually for at least three years and groundwater waterworks have conducted a minimum of three rounds of monitoring. (At least one sample shall have been taken since January 1, 1990.) The owner of any waterworks which uses a surface water source in whole or in part or a groundwater source waterworks shall demonstrate that all previous analytical results were less than the PMCL. Waterworks that use a new water source are not eligible for a waiver until three rounds of monitoring from the new source have been completed. (f) In determining the appropriate reduced monitoring frequency, the commissioner shall consider: (i) Reported concentrations from all previous monitoring; (ii) The degree of concentrations; and variation in reported  (iii) Other factors which may affect contaminant concentrations such as changes in groundwater pumping rates, changes in the waterworks configuration, changes in the waterworks operating procedures, or changes in stream flows or characteristics. (g) A decision by the commissioner to grant a waiver shall be made in writing and shall set forth the basis for the determination. The request for a Monday, July 3, 2000   Final Regulations waiver may be initiated by the commissioner or upon an application by the waterworks owner. The owner shall specify the basis for the request.

Virginia Register of Regulations 2650   Final Regulations (4) All community, nontransient noncommunity and noncommunity waterworks owners shall monitor to determine compliance with the PMCL for nitrate in Table 2.2. (a) Owners of community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks which use a groundwater source shall monitor annually beginning January 1, 1993. (b) Owners of community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks which use a surface water source in whole or in part shall monitor quarterly beginning January 1, 1993. (c) For community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks which use groundwater, the repeat monitoring frequency shall be quarterly for at least one year following any one sample in which the concentration is wE50% of the PMCL. The commissioner may allow the owner of a waterworks, which uses groundwater, to reduce the sampling frequency to annually after four consecutive quarterly samples are reliably and consistently less than the PMCL. (d) For community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks, the commissioner may allow the owner of a waterworks which uses a surface water source in whole or in part, to reduce the sampling frequency to annually if all analytical results from four consecutive quarters are <50% of the PMCL. Such waterworks shall return to quarterly monitoring if any one sample is >=50% of the PMCL. (e) The owners of all other noncommunity waterworks shall monitor annually beginning January 1, 1993. (f) After the initial round of quarterly sampling is completed, the owner of each community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks which is monitoring annually shall take subsequent samples during the quarter(s) which previously resulted in the highest analytical result. (5) All community, nontransient noncommunity and noncommunity waterworks owners shall monitor to determine compliance with the PMCL for nitrite in Table 2.2.

(c) Owners of waterworks which exceed the PMCL listed in Table 2.2 shall report to the commissioner within seven days and initiate three additional samples at the same sampling point within one month. (d) For initial analyses required by subdivision B 1 d (6)(a) or (b) of this section, data for waterworks which use surface water source in whole or in part acquired within one year prior to the effective date for arsenic monitoring and data for groundwater waterworks acquired within three years prior to the effective date for arsenic monitoring may be substituted at the discretion of the commissioner. 2. Organic chemicals. Owners of all community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks shall sample for organic chemical in accordance with their water source. Where two or more sources are combined before distribution, the waterworks owner shall sample at the entry point for the combined sources during periods of normal operating conditions. a. Owners of waterworks which use groundwater shall take a minimum of one sample at each entry point to the distribution system which is representative of each source, after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point). b. Owners of waterworks which use a surface water source in whole or in part shall take a minimum of one sample at points in the distribution system that are representative of each source or at each entry point to the distribution system, after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point). c. The owner of each community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks shall take four consecutive quarterly samples for each contaminant listed in Table 2.3 - VOC 2 through 21 and SOC during each compliance period, beginning in the compliance period starting January 1, 1993.  Monday, July 3, 2000   Final Regulations d. Reduced monitoring. (1) VOC. (a) If the initial monitoring for contaminants listed in Table 2.3 - VOC 1 through 8 and the monitoring for the contaminants listed in Table 2.3 - VOC 9 through 21 as allowed in subdivision 2 (1)(c) of this subsection has been completed by December 31, 1992, and the waterworks did not detect any contaminant listed in Table 2.3 - VOC 1 through 21, then the owner of each groundwater waterworks and waterworks which use a surface water source in whole or in part shall take one sample annually beginning January 1, 1993. (b) After a minimum of three years of annual sampling, the commissioner may allow the owner of a groundwater waterworks with no previous detection of any contaminant listed in Table 2.3 VOC 2 through 21 to take one sample during each compliance period. (c) The commissioner may allow the use of monitoring data collected after January 1, 1988, for purposes of initial monitoring compliance. If the data are generally consistent with the other requirements in this section, the commissioner may use these data (i.e., a single sample rather than four quarterly samples) to satisfy the initial monitoring requirement of subdivision B 2 c of this section. Waterworks which use grandfathered samples and did not detect any contaminants listed in Table 2.3 - VOC, 2 through 21, shall begin monitoring annually in accordance with subdivision 2 (1) (a) of this subsection beginning January 1, 1993. (2) SOC. (a) Waterworks serving more than 3,300 persons which do not detect a contaminant listed in Table 2.3 - SOC in the initial compliance period, may reduce the sampling frequency to a minimum of two quarterly samples in one year during each repeat compliance period. (b) Waterworks serving less than or equal to 3,300 persons which do not detect a contaminant listed in Table 2.3 - SOC in the initial compliance period may reduce the sampling frequency to a minimum of one sample during each repeat compliance period. e. Waiver application. (1) For VOCs. The owner of any community and nontransient noncommunity groundwater waterworks which does not detect a contaminant listed in Table 2.3 - VOC may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of subdivisions B 2 d (1) (a) and (b) of this section after completing the initial monitoring. A waiver shall be effective for no more than six years (two compliance periods). The commissioner may also issue waivers to small systems for the initial round of monitoring for 1,2,4trichlorobenzene. (2) For SOCs. The owner of any community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirement of subdivisions B 2 c and d (2) of this section. The waterworks owner shall reapply for a waiver for each compliance period. f. A commissioner may grant a waiver after evaluating the following factors: Knowledge of previous use (including transport, storage, or disposal) of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence of the source. If a determination by the commissioner reveals no previous use of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence, a waiver may be granted. If previous use of the contaminant is unknown or it has been used previously, then the following factors shall be used to determine whether a waiver is granted. (1) Previous analytical results. (2) The proximity of the waterworks to a potential point or nonpoint source of contamination. Point sources include spills and leaks of chemicals at or near a waterworks or at manufacturing, distribution, or storage facilities, or from hazardous and municipal waste landfills and other waste handling or treatment facilities. Nonpoint sources for SOCs include the use of pesticides to control insect and weed pests on agricultural areas, forest lands, home and gardens, and other land application uses. (3) The environmental persistence and transport of the contaminants listed in Table 2.3 VOC and SOC. (4) How well the water source is protected against contamination, such as whether it is a waterworks which uses a surface water source in whole or in part or whether it is a groundwater source waterworks. Groundwater source waterworks shall consider factors such as depth of the well, the type of soil, wellhead protection, and well structure integrity. Waterworks which use surface water in whole or in part shall consider watershed protection. (5) Special factors. (a) For VOCs. The number of persons served by the waterworks and the proximity of a smaller waterworks to a larger waterworks. (b) For SOCs. Elevated nitrate levels at the waterworks supply source. (c) For SOCs. Use of PCBs in equipment used in the production, storage, or distribution of water (i.e., PCBs used in pumps, transformers, etc.). g. Condition for waivers. (1) As a condition of the VOC waiver the owner of a groundwater waterworks shall take one sample at each sampling point during the time the waiver is effective (i.e., one sample during two compliance  Virginia Register of Regulations 2652   Final Regulations periods or six years) and update its vulnerability assessment considering the factors listed in subdivision B 2 f of this section. Based on this vulnerability assessment the commissioner shall reconfirm that the waterworks owner is nonvulnerable. If the commissioner does not make this reconfirmation within three years of the initial determination, then the waiver is invalidated and the waterworks is required to sample annually as specified in subdivision B 2 d (1)(a) of this sectio"

Indexes are published quarterly, and the last index of the year is cumulative. THE VIRGINIA REGISTER has several functions. The new and amended sections of regulations, both as proposed and as finally adopted, are required by law to be published in THE VIRGINIA REGISTER OF REGULATIONS. In addition, THE VIRGINIA REGISTER is a source of other information about state government, including all emergency regulations and executive orders issued by the Governor, the Virginia Tax Bulletin issued periodically by the Department of Taxation, and notices of public hearings and open meetings of state agencies. the agency to provide for additional public comment, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the period for which the Governor has provided for additional public comment; (iii) the Governor and the General Assembly exercise their authority to suspend the effective date of a regulation until the end of the next regular legislative session; or (iv) the agency suspends the regulatory process, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the 30-day public comment period. Proposed regulatory action may be withdrawn by the promulgating agency at any time before the regulation becomes final.  ADOPTION, AMENDMENT, AND REPEAL OF REGULATIONS An agency wishing to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations must first publish in the Virginia Register a notice of intended regulatory action; a basis, purpose, substance and issues statement; an economic impact analysis prepared by the Department of Planning and Budget; the agency's response to the economic impact analysis; a summary; a notice giving the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal; and the text of the proposed regulation. Following publication of the proposal in the Virginia Register, the promulgating agency receives public comments for a minimum of 60 days. The Governor reviews the proposed regulation to determine if it is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and if it is clearly written and easily understandable. If the Governor chooses to comment on the proposed regulation, his comments must be transmitted to the agency and the Registrar no later than 15 days following the completion of the 60-day public comment period. The Governor's comments, if any, will be published in the Virginia Register. Not less than 15 days following the completion of the 60day public comment period, the agency may adopt the proposed regulation. The appropriate standing committee of each branch of the General Assembly may meet during the promulgation or final adoption process and file an objection with the Registrar and the promulgating agency. The objection will be published in the Virginia Register. Within 21 days after receipt by the agency of a legislative objection, the agency shall file a response with the Registrar, the objecting legislative committee, and the Governor. When final action is taken, the agency again publishes the the regulation as adopted, highlighting all changes made proposed regulation and explaining any substantial changes since publication of the proposal. A 30-day final adoption begins upon final publication in the Virginia Register. text of to the made period  EMERGENCY REGULATIONS If an agency demonstrates that (i) there is an immediate threat to the public's health or safety; or (ii) Virginia statutory law, the appropriation act, federal law, or federal regulation requires a regulation to take effect no later than (a) 280 days from the enactment in the case of Virginia or federal law or the appropriation act, or (b) 280 days from the effective date of a federal regulation, it then requests the Governor's approval to adopt an emergency regulation. The emergency regulation becomes operative upon its adoption and filing with the Registrar of Regulations, unless a later date is specified. Emergency regulations are limited to addressing specifically defined situations and may not exceed 12 months in duration. Emergency regulations are published as soon as possible in the Register. During the time the emergency status is in effect, the agency may proceed with the adoption of permanent regulations through the usual procedures. To begin promulgating the replacement regulation, the agency must (i) file the Notice of Intended Regulatory Action with the Registrar within 60 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation; and (ii) file the proposed regulation with the Registrar within 180 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation. If the agency chooses not to adopt the regulations, the emergency status ends when the prescribed time limit expires.  STATEMENT The foregoing constitutes a generalized statement of the procedures to be followed. For specific statutory language, it is suggested that Article 2 ( 9-6.14:7.1 et seq.) of Chapter 1.1:1 of the Code of Virginia be examined carefully.

The notice will be published once at the same time the proposed regulation is published in the Proposed Regulations section of the Virginia Register. The notice will continue to be carried in the Calendar of Events section of the Virginia Register until the public comment period and public hearing date have passed. Notice is given in compliance with  9-6.14:7.1 of the Code of Virginia that the following public hearings and public comment periods regarding proposed state agency regulations are set to afford the public an opportunity to express their views.  PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS - PROPOSED REGULATIONS  TITLE 9. ENVIRONMENT STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD October 27, 1999  7 p.m.  Public Hearing Shenandoah County Brick Building, 112 South Main Street, 3rd Floor Conference Room, Woodstock, Virginia. November 29, 1999 - Public comments may be submitted until this date. Notice is hereby given in accordance with  9-6.14:7.1 of the Code of Virginia that the State Water Control Board intends to amend regulations entitled: 9 VAC 25-260-5 et seq. Water Quality Standards. Water Quality Standards consist of designated uses of the water body and narrative and numeric criteria that protect those uses by describing water quality in general terms and specifically as numerical limits for physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water. The State Water Control Board proposes to amend the State Water Control Board's Water Quality Standards at 9 VAC 25-260-350 and 9 VAC 25-260-400 to designate Stony Creek and its tributaries in Shenandoah County as a nutrient enriched water. If the water is designated nutrient enriched, a companion regulation, the Board's Policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters, 9 VAC 25-40-10 et seq., requires certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentration of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less. Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a design flow of 1.3 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus. Question and Answer Period: A question and answer period will be held one-half hour prior to the beginning of the public hearing at the same location. Department of Environmental Quality staff will be present to answer questions regarding the proposed action. Accessibility to Person with Disabilities: The hearing will be held at a public facility believed to be accessible to persons with disabilities. Any persons with questions on the accessibility of the facilities should contact Jean Gregory at Volume 16, Issue 1 15  the address or phone numbers in the contact information given below. Comments: The agency requests comments on any aspect of the proposal and also on the costs and benefits of the proposal. Alternatives: In compliance with the State Water Control Board's Public Participation Guidelines, 9 VAC 25-10-10 et seq., the department will consider all alternatives which are considered to be less burdensome and less intrusive for achieving the essential purpose of the proposed regulation and any other alternatives presented during the proposed rulemaking. Several alternatives have already been considered. One alternative was to leave the regulation unchanged. This may appear to be the least intrusive approach; however, such an alternative would not provide a control strategy for the potential water quality degradation in Stony Creek from an already documented excess of phosphorus. There may be other less intrusive alternatives to consider. For example, other alternatives would be to designate only the mainstem or a portion of the mainstem of Stony Creek as a nutrient enriched water. Other Pertinent Information: The department has conducted analyses on the proposed action related to basis, substance, issues, need, estimated impacts, applicable federal requirements and alternative approaches and schedule for reevaluation. These analyses as well as copies of the amendments may be viewed at the Department of Environmental Quality, Valley Regional Office, 4411 Early Road, Harrisonburg, VA 22801 or obtained from Jean Gregory.

PROPOSED REGULATIONS  TITLE 9. ENVIRONMENT STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD Title of Regulation: 9 VAC 25-260-5 et seq. Water Quality Standards (amending 9 VAC 25-260-350 and 9 VAC 25260-400). Statutory Authority:  62.1-44.15(3a) of the Code of Virginia. Public Hearing Date: October 27, 1999 - 7 p.m. Public comments may be submitted until November 29, 1999. (See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: Section 62.1-44.15(3a) of the Code of Virginia authorizes the State Water Control Board to establish water quality standards and policies for any state waters consistent with the purpose and general policy of the State Water Control Law, and to modify, amend or cancel any such standards or policies established. Such standards shall be adopted only after a hearing is held and the board takes into consideration the economic and social costs and benefits which can reasonably be expected to be obtained as a result of the standards as adopted, modified or canceled. Purpose: Amendments to the Water Quality Standards (9 VAC 25-260-350 and 9 VAC 25-260-400 section 6) are proposed to designate Stony Creek and its tributaries as nutrient enriched waters in order to hold the line on nutrient enrichment in these waters via the point source total phosphorus control requirements in the board's Policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters (9 VAC 25-40-10 et seq.). The proposed regulation is essential in protecting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. It will enhance the department's ability to protect the water quality and living resources of Stony Creek for consumption of fish, recreation uses and conservation in general. Although nutrients such as phosphorus are necessary for the growth of algae which are an essential part of the food chain, problems occur when an overabundance of these nutrients cause excessive growths of algae. Excessive amounts of aquatic plants, particularly algae, can discolor the water, create taste and odor problems for water supply managers, reduce water clarity and block sunlight from submerged aquatic vegetation. Another side effect of excessive algal blooms is impairment of primary contact recreation due to the aesthetically displeasing appearance of the water. The most serious problem resulting from algal growth occurs when the plants die and decay; at that time they can deplete the oxygen level of the water to the point where fish and other aquatic organisms cannot survive. It is important, therefore, that there are nutrient controls so that the symptoms of nutrient  enrichment, i.e., the excessive growth of plants and fluctuating levels of dissolved oxygen, be avoided. The proposed regulation is also essential for the efficient and economical performance of an important governmental function. The amendment will establish the appropriate standards for use in calculating permit limits for point source discharges under the Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System Permit program. Substance: The department's evaluation of agency in-stream nutrient monitoring data for Stony Creek for the period of July 6, 1994, through May 6, 1997, indicates nutrient enriched conditions. Consequently, the department proposes that the watershed (Stony Creek and its tributaries) qualifies for regulatory designation as a nutrient enriched water. The basis for this determination was monitoring data for total phosphorus, which is one of three indicators of nutrient enrichment used for regulatory designation of waters as nutrient enriched. If the water is designated nutrient enriched a companion regulation, the board's policy for Nutrient Enriched waters (9 VAC 25-40-10), requires certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentrations of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less. Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a design flow of 1.3 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus. Issues: Total phosphorus is one of three indicators of nutrient enrichment used for regulatory designation of waters as nutrient enriched. The department's monitoring data indicate that total phosphorus levels in this creek are above the nutrient enrichment trigger for this parameter. Several citizens at the public meeting were concerned that we were not basing the designation on nitrogen levels in the creek, but the technical advisory committee report which we use to evaluate whether a waterbody is nutrient enriched does not consider nitrogen to be an appropriate indicator of nutrient enrichment in flowing waters. Several citizens have inquired whether designation of Stony Creek as a nutrient enriched water will automatically place it on the 303(d) list. 303(d) refers to a section of the federal Clean Water Act that, in conjunction with a 1992 federal regulation, requires the states to notify the public and submit a list to the Environmental Protection Agency of those waters which are not meeting water quality standards or are indicating declining quality and potential problems. There are five parts to the list and Total Maximum Daily Loads (which are usually called TMDLs) are to be developed for waters placed on parts 1 and 2 which are those waters identified through monitoring or modeling to not meet water quality standards. Waters designated as nutrient enriched in the standards regulation are both identified in the 305(b) report  Virginia Register of Regulations 18   Proposed Regulations and listed in part IV of the 303(d) list as ""fully supported but threatened"" for nutrients. A threatened listing does not result in the development of TMDLs, which is Total Maximum Daily Loads, but its listing does draw careful attention to the waterbody and biological and chemical monitoring will continue in these waters to determine the impact. The above may be perceived as disadvantages to the public. There are no disadvantages to the department for the implementation or enforcement of the proposed amendment. Impact: If these waters are designated as nutrient enriched, a companion regulation, the board's Policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters (9 VAC 25-40-10 et seq.), would require certain point source dischargers to these waters with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentration of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less. Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a flow of 1.3 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus. The other three point source dischargers in the watershed, Stony Creek Sanitary District, Shrine Mont, and Edinburg Sewage Treatment Plant, have design flows below that covered in the Policy and thus would not be required to install phosphorus controls. New dischargers with flows greater than or equal to 50,000 gallons per day who propose to discharge to these nutrient enriched waters would be required to meet the monthly average total phosphorus effluent limitation of 2 mg/l. Because the amendment is specific to that area and not statewide in nature, Shenandoah County could be considered ""particularly affected."" Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with  9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98). Section 9-6.14:7.1 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property. The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts. Summary of the proposed regulation. The proposed regulation amends the Commonwealth's Water Quality Standards Regulation to designate Stony Creek and its tributaries in Shenandoah County as a nutrient enriched water. When a water body is designated as nutrient enriched, a companion regulation (the board's policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters (9 VAC 25-40-10)) requires that certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater, and whose effluents contain phosphorus, maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentrations of two milligrams per liter or less. The only point source discharger impacted by this requirement would be Rocco Farm Foods, near Edinburg, which has a design flow of 1.3 MGD. Estimated economic impact. As discussed above, a consequence of this regulation is that dischargers into Stony Creek with a design flow of 1.0 MGD must install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorous. Currently, Rocco Farm Foods would be the only point source discharger that would be subject to this requirement. There are two sets of economic impacts that may arise because of this requirement. One result of this requirement could be that Rocco Farm Foods could redesign its flow operations so that the design flow would be less than 1.0 MGD. Another set of impacts result if Rocco Farm Foods keeps its current design flow and installs a phosphorus removal system. The requirement to install phosphorus removal systems only applies to sources with design flow greater than 1.0 MGD. Rocco Farm Foods currently has a design flow of 1.3 MGD. It might be possible for Rocco to redesign its processes to reduce its design flow to below 1.0 MGD. If Rocco could do this, it would no longer be subject to the requirement to install phosphorus removal systems. However, while this is theoretically possible, discussions with Tim Moppin, in charge of environmental permitting for Rocco Farm Foods, suggest that it would be very difficult for Rocco to reduce its design flow to under 1.0 MGD, and therefore that it would not be likely that they would do so (Conversation with Moppin, 4-1699). This implies that Rocco expects that the cost of reducing its design flow to exceed the cost of the installation of the phosphorus removal systems. Instead of reducing its design flow to under 1.0 MGD, it is likely that, due to the requirements arising because of this regulation, Rocco Farm Foods will install a phosphorus removal system. We therefore need to examine the costs and benefits arising from this installation. The costs associated with this installation are somewhat uncertain, because very little phosphorus-specific removal systems have been developed. Rocco Farm Foods is working with Professor Clifford Randall of Virginia Tech to develop this system. The exact cost of this system is uncertain, because it is early in its development. However, one rough estimate is that installation of this system will cost two million dollars, according to Tim Moppin (Conversation with Moppin, 4-1699). Another rough estimate from John Reid, a consulting engineer located in Fredericksburg, given to Bob Wolfe of Rocco, was two and a half million dollars (Email from Clifford Randall). Other costs could include the continuing costs of operating this system, and the cost of enforcing the permit. Rocco does not expect there to be substantial continuing costs of operation (Conversation with Bob Wolfe, Rocco Farms, 4-26-99). Also, the Department of Environmental quality does not expect that any extra resources will be necessary to enforce this permit (Conversation with Jean Gregory, 4-16-99). Thus, the costs of this regulation appear to be primarily the costs of installing the phosphorus removal system. On the other hand, there will be many benefits from this installation, but these benefits are very difficult to quantify. After installation of the removal system, Rocco Farm Foods expects discharges of phosphorus to be significantly reduced Monday, September 27, 1999 19  Volume 16, Issue 1   Proposed Regulations (Conversation with Moppin, 4-16-99). This improvement in water quality will have several beneficial effects. There are many fish and wildlife affected by the water quality of Stony Creek. The wood turtle, which is listed as threatened by the Commonwealth of Virginia, has been documented near Stony Creek. Improvements in water quality are expected to be beneficial to this species (Comment by Department of Conservation and Recreation, from Public Comments on this Regulation, 11-20-98). Also, a trout fishery is located near the discharge point of Rocco Farm Foods. Reducing the level of phosphorus in Stony Creek will lead to higher levels of dissolved oxygen which will greatly benefit this trout fishery. There are also aesthetic and recreational benefits from reducing phosphorus discharges. Stony Creek itself has aesthetically pleasing clear water. To keep this water clear, reductions in phosphorus levels are necessary to prevent significant increases in algae. Also, this region offers opportunities for ecotourism. Maintenance of the water quality of Stony Creek is important to these opportunities. Additionally, Stony Creek flows into the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, and much rafting activities take place on the Shenandoah River. These rafting activities also will be benefited by maintenance of the water quality of Stony Creek. A further advantage arises because the waters from Stony Creek eventually reach the Chesapeake Bay. Reducing phosphorus discharges into Stony Creek can therefore reduce the amount of phosphorus entering the Bay. While all of these are advantages to the installation of the phosphorus removal system by Rocco Farm Foods, it is difficult to determine the monetary value of these advantages. Doing so is beyond the scope of this review. However, such an investigation would examine the following: the value of improving the likelihood of survival of the wood turtle in this region; the value of improved trout size and yield at the trout fishery; the value placed on the cleanliness of Stony Creek by residents of the Commonwealth; additional profits for rafting and ecotourism operators, arising due to the improvement of the water quality of Stony Creek; and the cost of the next best alternative to reducing the same amount of phosphorus discharges into the Chesapeake Bay. These are all significant values, but they are also difficult to quantify. The sum of these values could then be compared to the cost of installing the removal system, along with the costs of operating this system. Businesses and entities affected. This regulation will directly affect Rocco Farm Foods. Businesses indirectly affected include a trout fishery located nearby the Rocco discharge point, and operators of ecotourism and rafting in the area, and along the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. Localities particularly affected. The Rocco Farm Foods facility is near the town of Edinburg. This locality will be principally affected by this regulation. Projected impact on employment. The proposed regulation is not expected to have any affect on employment (Conversation with Bob Wolfe, Rocco Farms, 4-26-99). Effects on the use and value of private property. This regulation will lead to the installation of a costly phosphorus *  removal system. However, once this is installed, it is not expected to have any substantial negative effect on private property. Summary of analysis. The proposed regulation designates Stony Creek and its tributaries in Shenandoah County as nutrient enriched water. A consequence of this regulation is that municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater must maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentrations of two milligrams per liter or less. Because of this, Rocco Farm Foods, which has a design flow of 1.3 MGD, must either reduce its design flow below 1.0 MGD or install a phosphorus removal system. It is expected that Rocco will install a phosphorus removal system. While it is currently unclear exactly what phosphorus removal system will be installed, it is expected that the cost of whatever system is installed will be approximately two million dollars. There will be many benefits resulting from the decreased discharges of phosphorus. These benefits include protection of fish and wildlife nearby, improvement of the aesthetic quality of the river, maintenance of recreational opportunities including rafting, and a reduction of phosphorus discharges into the Chesapeake Bay. It is difficult to assess a monetary value to any of these benefits, but it is expected that these benefits will be substantial. Agency's Response to the Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The department has reviewed the economic impact analysis prepared by the Department of Planning and Budget and has no comment. Summary: The proposed amendments designate Stony Creek and its tributaries in Shenandoah County as a nutrient enriched water. If the water is designated nutrient enriched a companion regulation, the board's policy for Nutrient Enriched waters (9 VAC 25-40-10), requires certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentration of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less. Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a design flow of 1.3 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus. 9 VAC 25-260-350. waters.

GAMING VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION REPROPOSED  6f  IV  PWS pH-6.5-9.5  6g  IV  pH-6.5-9.5  Title of Regulation: 11 VAC 10-60-10 et seq. Regulations Pertaining to Horse Racing with Pari-Mutuel Wagering: Participants (amending 11 VAC 10-60-10, 11 VAC 10-6020, 11 VAC 10-60-40, 11 VAC 10-60-70, 11 VAC 10-60-120, 11 VAC 10-60-130, 11 VAC 10-60-140, and 11 VAC 10-60150; adding 11 VAC 10-60-15, 11 VAC 10-60-290, 11 VAC 10-60-300, 11 VAC 10-60-310, and 11 VAC 10-60-320; repealing 11 VAC 10-60-30 and 11 VAC 10-60-60). Statutory Authority:  59.1-369 of the Code of Virginia. Public Hearing Date: N/A -- Public comments may be submitted until November 29, 1999. (See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: The Virginia Racing Commission derives its statutory authority to promulgate regulations from the provisions of  59.1-369 of the Code of Virginia. The section states, in part in subdivision 3, ""The Commission shall promulgate regulations and conditions under which horse racing with parimutuel wagering shall be conducted in the Commonwealth, and all such other regulations it deems necessary and appropriate to effect the purposes of the chapter."" The proposed regulation was published in its proposed version in the October 12, 1998, issue of the Register of Regulations. A public hearing was held on the regulation on November 18, 1998. After receiving written and oral comment on the proposed action, staff met with interested parties to revise the proposed version. On advice from counsel from the Attorney General's Office, the commission at its August 18, 1999, meeting voted to put the revisions in the proposed regulation out for an additional 60-day period of public comment. Purpose: The commission has promulgated this regulation to achieve its statutory purpose of maintaining horse racing in the Commonwealth of the highest quality. The proposed regulation reflects more closely the intent of the statute regarding the consideration of applications for participation in horse racing thereby eliminating the provisional permit. Furthermore, the regulation takes into account changes in standard operating procedures found at most racetracks in the mid-Atlantic region since the current regulation was promulgated eight years ago. The proposed regulation  V ***  pH-6.5-9.5  VI iv  iv  6h  IV  6i  IV  PWS pH-6.5-9.5  Virginia Register of Regulations 30   Proposed Regulations amends the existing regulation pertaining to participants in horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering to promote the public health, safety and welfare. Substance: The proposed regulation repeals the sections pertaining to provisional permits and clarifies the procedures under which applications for permits shall be considered by the commission. The regulation also clarifies the responsibilities of participants regarding alcohol and drug testing, provision of workers' compensation insurance coverage for employees, disorderly conduct and unwarranted objections. The regulation also specifies that permit holders shall provide a current mailing address. Further, the regulation incorporates the practices of other jurisdictions, primarily Maryland, regarding the responsibilities placed upon owners of racehorses. These amendments were necessitated by the demise of the thoroughbred ownership registry of The Jockey Club. The proposed regulation incorporates the practices of other jurisdictions as to the responsibilities placed upon jockeys and apprentice jockeys. It also introduces an apprentice certificate that has been instituted among the racing states in the midAtlantic region. It also establishes a multiple engagement regulation for a jockey that parallels regulations in other jurisdictions. The proposed action more appropriately shifts four categories of permit holders from the chapter pertaining to racing officials to the chapter pertaining to participants. Following the public hearing and the close of the period of public comment, commission staff held extensive meetings with racing officials, representatives of the Jockeys' Guild and the Maryland Jockey Club. As a result, the following sections were revised after the regulation was published in its proposed version. The revisions are: 11 VAC 10-60-10: In subsection H, the felonies considered detrimental to horse racing in the Commonwealth are specified, and in subsection V, the original language is restored but the levels of alcohol content are reduced. 11 VAC 10-60-40: In subsection C, the original language is restored and the proposed language is stricken. In subsection D, the age limitation is stricken from the proposed version. In subsection H, the term of leases is stricken. In subsection I, the word ""written"" is substituted for the word ""notarized"" and the requirement of a legal name accompanying a stable name is stricken. The registration requirements, notification of a change of trainer, and prohibitions on owners in subsections K, L and M are stricken. 11 VAC 10-60-70: In subsection D, the revision allows a trainer to participate as a jockey but the jockey may only ride horses he trains. In subsection F, the provision for workers' compensation insurance is eliminated as unnecessary. In subsection G, the wording ""or a permit in Virginia"" is added to conform to other similar provisions. 11 VAC 10-60-120: In subsection T, the revised language clarifies the weighing in procedures and the amount of overweight carried by the jockey during the running of a race. 11 VAC 10-60-320: The revised language eliminates the requirement upon the track superintendent of having the Volume 16, Issue 1 31 necessary personnel and equipment available. It has been determined that this is the responsibility of the licensee and not one of its employees. Issues: The proposed regulation was promulgated with the input of counsel from the Attorney General's Office as well as the commission's experience in operating the first five race meetings at Colonial Downs. Furthermore, representatives of the horse industry, primarily the Jockeys' Guild and racing officials from Colonial Downs and the Maryland Jockey Club were intensely involved in the revision of the proposed regulation. The proposed regulation essentially updates the previous regulation by eliminating outmoded procedures. The proposed regulation further creates the advantage of providing uniformity among neighboring jurisdictions while not creating a disadvantage for the Commonwealth or the public. Summary: The proposed amendments incorporate the changes in standard operating procedures for racetracks in the midAtlantic region; allow licensees reciprocity if licensed in another state with similar regulatory requirements; and clarify sections with permit application procedures, including the repeal of provisional permits. The proposed version of the regulation has been revised to reflect the public comment received during the public hearing and the period of public comment. 11 VAC 10-60-10. Generally. No person shall participate in any horse racing subject to the jurisdiction of the commission or in the conduct of a race meeting or pari-mutuel wagering of the race meeting unless the person possesses a permit from the commission and complies with the provisions of the Act and the regulations of the commission. Permits issued by the commission are not transferable. A. Application for permit. A person desiring to obtain a permit to participate in horse racing, with pari-mutuel wagering, shall make an application for a permit on a form prescribed by the commission. The application shall be accompanied by a fee prescribed by the commission and the cost of fingerprinting. The applicant shall be photographed. The applicant shall also be fingerprinted upon making his initial application in the Commonwealth and at least once every five years thereafter. The application shall be verified by the oath or affirmation of the applicant. B. Fee schedule. Before submitting an application for a permit as a participant, the applicant shall consult the fee schedule (11 VAC 10-60-15) of the Virginia Racing Commission to ascertain the applicable fee, make out a check or money order payable to the Virginia Racing Commission or pay in cash the full amount of the fee, and submit the fee with the application. C. Provisional permit. Pending the completion of a background investigation into the qualifications and fitness of an applicant for a permit, the commission shall grant a provisional permit in accordance with the following provisions: 1. The applicant shall be permitted to participate in horse racing to the extent allowed by the permit for which application was made; Monday, September 27, 1999   Proposed Regulations 2. The applicant, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, could not have made application in time for a decision to be made on the applicant's qualifications and fitness; and 3. The commission has no reason to believe that the applicant is ineligible for the permit for which application was made. D. Termination of provisional permit. A provisional permit shall terminate upon a decision of the commission to approve or deny the application for a permit, or 120 days after the grant of the provisional permit, whichever occurs first. A provisional permit shall carry no presumption of qualifications or fitness, and may be terminated summarily by the commission for cause. E. Recommendation by stewards. The stewards, employed as racing officials by the commission, shall promptly consider an application, and shall approve or deny the application based on the information in the application and all other information before them, including any investigation they deem appropriate. If an application is approved by the stewards, the permit shall be valid for one year. F. Denial of application. The stewards shall deny the application, if they find that the approval of a permit for the person would not be in the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth, or the horse racing industry of the Commonwealth, or would reflect adversely on the honesty and integrity of the horse racing industry in the Commonwealth, or that the applicant: 1. Has knowingly made a false statement of a material fact in the application, or has deliberately failed to disclose any information requested by the commission; 2. Is or has been guilty of any corrupt or fraudulent practice or conduct in connection with any horse race meeting in this or any other state; 3. Has knowingly failed to comply with the provisions of the Act or the regulations of the commission; 4. Has had a permit to engage in activity related to horse racing denied for just cause, suspended or revoked in any other jurisdiction, and such denial, suspension or revocation is still in effect; 5. Is not qualified to perform the duties required for the permit sought; or 6. Has been convicted in any jurisdiction of a misdemeanor or felony involving unlawful conduct or wagering, fraudulent use of a credential, unlawful transmission of information, touting, bribery, administration or possession of drugs or any misdemeanor or felony considered by the commission to be detrimental to horse racing in the Commonwealth. G. Denial is final. The denial of an application by the stewards as a participant in horse racing shall be final unless an appeal is made by the applicant under the provisions of these regulations. C. Reciprocity. The commission shall conduct a review of the statutes of other jurisdictions pertaining to horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering to ascertain which jurisdictions have substantially the same standards as those of Virginia. Upon submission of an application and payment of the prescribed fee by a holder of a permit, license or other similar document from those jurisdictions whose standards for permits, licenses or similar documents are substantially the same, the commission may, in its discretion, grant reciprocity to the applicant provided that the applicant has not been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony. D. Fingerprinting. The applicant shall be fingerprinted upon making his initial application in the Commonwealth and at least once every five years thereafter. The commission may waive this requirement in connection with an application for a permit by reciprocity with another jurisdiction provided that the applicant was fingerprinted and was subjected to a criminal history record information check in a jurisdiction whose laws governing fingerprinting and background investigations are substantially the same as required by Virginia and that he has not been convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony. However, the commission, in its discretion, may require fingerprints from any applicant or holder of a permit at any time. E. Consideration of application. The commission, acting through its executive secretary or other designee, shall promptly consider any application for a permit and issue the permit based on the information contained in the application and all other information before it, including any investigation it deems appropriate. If an application for a permit is approved, the commission shall issue the permit. F. Denial of application. If from the face of the application, an applicant appears ineligible because of the requirements specified in  59.1-389 B of the Code of Virginia, his application shall be denied by the commission, acting through its executive secretary or other designee. The commission may deny an application for a permit for the reason specified in  59.1-389 C of the Code of Virginia. Absent mitigating circumstances, the application for a permit shall be denied if the applicant has [ been convicted for solicitation/prostitution within five years next preceding the application date or has ] three or more misdemeanor convictions, regardless of offense, within five years preceding the application date. If the applicant has multiple convictions of the same offense on the same day, it shall not constitute three or more misdemeanor convictions for purposes of this regulation. The applicant may withdraw his application prior to denial. G. Ineligible applicant. If it appears that the applicant may be ineligible because he has committed a felony or misdemeanor that may be detrimental to horse racing in the Commonwealth, he shall be afforded the opportunity to withdraw his application or request a hearing before a steward regarding his application. However, the commission, in its discretion, may issue a permit to an applicant providing the felony or misdemeanor is not one of those listed in  59.1389 B 6 of the Code of Virginia. [ H. Felonies considered detrimental. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the following felonies are considered detrimental to horse racing in Virginia and the commission, acting through its executive secretary or other designee, shall deny the application and refuse to issue the permit if the applicant has been convicted of any of them:  Virginia Register of Regulations 32   Proposed Regulations 1.

But in no event may a weight allowance be claimed for more than two years from the date of the fifth winning mount, unless an extension has been granted under the provisions of this regulation. 5. An apprentice who possesses a contractual agreement may claim an allowance of three pounds for an additional one year when riding horses owned or trained by the original contract employer. I. H. Extension of apprentice allowance. The stewards, in their discretion, may extend the apprentice allowance because of time lost by disability arising out of an accident and injury incurred while plying his trade or by military service, disabling illness or restrictions on horse racing. In order to qualify for the extension, he shall have been rendered unable to ride for a period of not less than 14 consecutive days during the period in which he was entitled to an apprentice allowance. The commission or its designee may extend the weight allowance of an apprentice jockey when an apprentice jockey is unable to continue riding due to (i) physical disablement or illness, (ii) military service, (iii) attendance in an institution of secondary or higher education, (iv) restriction on racing, or (v) other valid reasons. 1. In order to qualify for an extension, an apprentice jockey shall have been rendered unable to ride for a period of not less than seven consecutive days during the period in which the apprentice was entitled to an apprentice weight allowance. Under exceptional circumstances, the commission or its designee will give consideration to the total days lost collectively. 2. The commission or its designee shall authority to grant an extension to an eligible but only after the apprentice jockey has documentation to them verifying the days lost by this regulation. have the applicant, submitted as defined  3. An apprentice jockey may petition the commission or its designee for an extension of time for claiming apprentice weight allowances, and the apprentice jockey shall be bound by the decision of the commission or its designee.

If any owner, or his trainer or authorized agent, engages two or more jockeys after scratch time to ride the same horse in the same race after the time designated by the racing secretary to name jockeys, the owner shall pay the unplaced fee to the jockey not riding his horse in the race jockey taken off the horse a matching fee equal to that earned by the jockey who rode the horse. No owner shall be held liable for multiple engagements where such engagements are the results of actions taken by jockeys or their agents. An owner or trainer who elects to remove a jockey from his mount after the time designated by the racing secretary for naming jockeys may be subject to disciplinary action by the stewards. Q. P. Duty to fulfill engagements. A jockey shall fulfill his duly scheduled riding engagements, unless excused by the stewards. No jockey shall be forced to ride a horse he believes to be unsound or over a racing surface that he believes to be unsafe.

Statutory Authority:  32.1-12 and 32.1-64.1 of the Code of Virginia. Public Hearing Date: N/A -- Public comments may be submitted until November 26, 1999. (See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: The existing Virginia Hearing Impairment Identification and Monitoring System was adopted in 1987 under the authority of  32.1-64.1 and 32.1-64.2 of the Code of Virginia. Section 32.1-64.1 of the Code requires the State Health Commissioner to establish and maintain the Virginia Hearing Impairment Identification and Monitoring System and requires the State Board of Health to promulgate regulations for implementing this system. In addition, SB 591 (1998 Acts of Assembly, Chapter 506) amended  32.1-64.1 to require the State Board of Health to ""provide by regulation for the giving of hearing screening tests for all infants born in all hospitals,"" thereby requiring the proposed amendments. Purpose: The purpose of the regulations and the intended amendments is to provide consistent guidance for the implementation and administration of a system designed to ensure that all infants born in Virginia with hearing loss are identified and receive appropriate intervention at the earliest possible age after birth. This system promotes early intervention that is crucial in preventing learning problems, social problems and costly remedial education activities for children with hearing loss. The amendments are needed to improve and hone the system and allow it to comport with the changes in the law. Substance: The proposed regulations will specify the responsibilities of hospitals with neonatal intensive care services, hospitals with newborn nurseries, the Virginia Department of Health, and persons providing audiological services to children following discharge from the hospital after birth. These responsibilities are identified as beginning July 1, 1999, and July 1, 2000. As required by SB 591, on July 1, 1999, hospitals with neonatal intensive care services will be responsible for screening the hearing of all infants prior to discharge after birth, providing test results and other pertinent information to the parent and the child's primary medical care provider, and reporting those results and other data to the Virginia Department of Health. Hospitals with newborn nurseries and no neonatal intensive care services will be responsible for identifying infants who are at risk for hearing loss, as they are required to do under the current regulations; providing specific Volume 16, Issue 1 49 information and recommendations for follow-up to the parent and to the child's primary medical care provider; and reporting those infants who are at risk to the Virginia Department of Health. Hospitals that are not required to screen the hearing of all infants before July 1, 2000, but elect to do so will not be required to report infants who are at risk for hearing loss. They will be given the same responsibilities as hospitals with neonatal intensive care services. As of July 1, 2000, all hospitals with newborn nurseries and all hospitals with neonatal intensive care services will be responsible for screening the hearing of all infants prior to discharge after birth, providing test results and other pertinent information to the child's parent and to the child's primary medical care provider, and reporting those results and other data to the Virginia Department of Health. The Virginia Department of Health will be responsible for (i) collecting, maintaining and evaluating the data reported by hospitals, reports from audiological follow-up and information regarding intervention referrals in a database; (ii) providing follow-up for reported infants that includes letters and information to parents; (iii) supplying the reporting format, written information, as well as training and technical assistance on the program to hospitals; (iv) conducting a yearly review and evaluation of the program; and (v) communicating performance data to hospitals on a yearly basis. Persons who provide audiological services to a child once that child is discharged from the hospital after birth will be responsible for providing screening or evaluation results to the parent and the child's primary medical care provider; sending a complete report to the Virginia Department of Health; advising the parent about and offering referral to early intervention and education programs; and providing the parent of any child found to have a hearing loss with information about hearing loss, such as communication and amplification options and resource agencies and services. Issues: The primary advantages of these amendments for the public are for parents, children who are born with hearing loss, hospitals and local education agencies. Parents will be informed of results of the hearing screening and need for further testing before their newborn is discharged from the hospital after birth. With the early identification of a child's hearing loss, parents can make informed choices regarding early intervention and education methods that will benefit both the child and the family. Recent research suggests that when hearing loss is identified by three months of age and intervention is offered before six months of age, children with hearing loss stay competitive with hearing peers in language and social skills. Further, the advantages remain regardless of the level of hearing loss, the child's cognitive skills or the method of intervention. The amount of information that hospitals will be required to report to the Virginia Department of Health is reduced, as they are currently submitting a report form on every infant discharged after birth. With the early identification of hearing loss, there will be a savings to local education agencies. Research suggests that Monday, September 27, 1999   Proposed Regulations costs of special education services are reduced when hearing loss is identified and intervention initiated within the first year of life. There are no disadvantages to the public or to the agency. Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with  9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98). Section 96.14:7.1 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property. The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts. Summary of the proposed regulation. Section 32.1-64.1 of the Code of Virginia requires the State Health Commissioner to establish and maintain the Virginia Hearing Impairment Identification and Monitoring System and requires the State Board of Health to promulgate regulations for implementing this system. The 1998 General Assembly (Chapter 506) amended  32.1-64.1 to require the State Board of Health to ""provide by regulation for the giving of hearing screening tests for all infants born in all hospitals."" The proposed changes to this regulation are designed to comply with this mandate. Estimated economic impact. Under current regulations, hospitals are required to screen the hearing of only those infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) who are identified to be at risk for hearing impairment according to specific indicators. According to the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), approximately 10% of Virginia newborns are admitted to a NICU. Since presumably not all NICU infants exhibit the specified risk indicators, hospitals are required to screen the hearing of fewer than 10% of Virginia newborns. The proposed amended regulation requires that starting July 1, 1999, all hospitals with neonatal intensive care services screen the hearing of all newborns, whether or not they have been admitted to the NICU. In 1996, 59% (54,130 out of 92,115) of the children born in Virginia hospitals were born in hospitals with a NICU. As of July 1, 2000, the proposed amended regulation requires all Virginia hospitals to screen the hearing of all their newborns. Increasing the percentage of newborns screened for hearing impairment from less than 10% to 100% will be costly, but will have clear, if not entirely quantifiable benefits. In a study (Colorado study) published in the journal Pediatrics1 it was shown that at 26 Colorado hospitals which screened all their newborns for hearing impairment, 50% of the children that were proven to have congenital hearing loss did not exhibit the standard risk factors. Thus, it is likely that if Virginia 1  screens the hearing of all newborns instead of only NICU newborns that exhibit specified risk factors, the number of Virginia infants who are diagnosed with congenital hearing loss shortly after birth may increase twofold or more. For the 90% of children with congenital hearing loss who do not have profound hearing loss, research has shown that through early hearing amplification and appropriate therapy these children achieve near-normal language development, significantly exceeding the language development of comparable children not identified until after 6 months of age2. For the children with profound hearing loss, early detection allows for early initiation of sign language or cochlear implants, if appropriate. In the Colorado study it was calculated that on average it costs $25 per infant to screen all newborns. That calculation takes account of labor costs, disposable supplies and amortized capital equipment costs. The average costs for the screening of newborns for other maladies are less per infant, but the occurrence of those maladies are significantly less common. According to the Colorado study, screening costs per confirmed diagnosis are as follows: $9,600 for congenital hearing loss, $10,800 for hypothyroidism, $23,100 for hemoglobinopathy and $40,500 for PKU. Screenings for the last three maladies in that list are currently conducted for all newborns in Virginia. In addition to improved language development, early detection of hearing impairment allows for some reduction of costs that otherwise would occur. According to the Colorado study, additional expenses accrue for children not diagnosed at birth who go on to require some form of special intervention once they reach school age. The study asserts that all screening costs could be recovered after 10 years due to subsequent savings in avoided intervention. Though that calculation may be optimistic, it is noteworthy that at least some of the screening costs may be recouped through avoided intervention. The net economic impact of the proposed changes to this regulation would likely be positive. It is very likely that the proposed increase in screening would result in significantly increased early detection of congenital hearing loss. The additional children diagnosed with hearing impairment would be able to receive early treatment, which would most likely significantly improve their language skills. This would provide the non-quantifiable benefit of happier children and parents, as well as an improved economic future. The cost of the proposed screenings would be about the same or less per confirmed diagnosis as other health screenings currently conducted in Virginia for all newborns. The initial screening costs would also be countered somewhat by a reduction in the future costs of special intervention for students with language deficiencies and hearing problems.

Localities particularly affected. The proposed regulatory changes affect all Virginia localities. Projected impact on employment. VDH estimates that each hospital will likely need to hire a 25% FTE audiologist or nurse to run the program, plus additional hours for a nurse or technician to run the tests (the number of hours depend on the number of newborns at the hospital). Effects on the use and value of private property. The implementation of the proposed regulatory changes would require the purchase of hearing screening equipment for many of Virginia's hospitals with nurseries, but no NICU. VDH estimates that the equipment would cost between $10,000 to $15,000. Firms that sell such equipment would clearly benefit while hospitals would incur an additional expense. Agency's Response to the Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with  9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98) and submitted that analysis on July 9, 1999. The Virginia Department of Health agrees with DPB's overall analysis. Summary: The proposed amendments comply with the statutory changes to  32.1-64.1 of the Code of Virginia. The purpose of the regulations is to provide consistent guidance for the implementation and administration of a system designed to ensure that all infants born in Virginia with hearing loss are identified and receive appropriate intervention at the earliest possible age after birth. The proposed regulation will amend the responsibilities of hospitals with neonatal intensive care services and hospitals with newborn nurseries regarding newborn hearing screening, parent education and follow-up; modify the newborn hearing screening protocols; amend the Virginia Department of Health responsibilities; and add reporting requirements for persons who provide audiological services to children following discharge from the hospital after birth. These responsibilities are identified as beginning July 1, 1999, in hospitals with neonatal intensive care services and July 1, 2000, in all hospitals with newborn nurseries. CHAPTER 80.

Summary: This regulation was promulgated in 1997 to carry out the provisions of the Consumer Real Estate Settlement Protection Act ( 6.1-2.19 et seq. of the Code of Virginia). The original proposed changes contained in the draft attached to the State Corporation Commission's ""Order To Take Notice"" date July 28, 1999, are being made to comply with the provisions enacted during the 1999 Session of the Virginia General Assembly pursuant to Senate Bill No. 1278 (Chapter 647 of the 1999 Acts of Assembly) regarding ""lay real estate settlement agents."" Changes are also being proposed to require settlement agents to keep separate escrow accounts for Virginia settlement funds. The revised proposed changes contained in the latest draft attached to the State Corporation Commission's ""Order to Take Notice"" dated August 31, 1999, clarify that a ""lay real estate settlement agent"" who provides escrow, closing, or settlement services in transactions involving multiple parcels or tracts of real estate located wholly or partially outside of Virginia must maintain another separate escrow account for those settlement funds. This latest revision takes into account the fact that lay real estate settlement agents may provide settlement services on real estate involving multiple locations, some of which may be located in other states.

Purpose: Amendments are proposed pursuant to a biennial review of regulations as required by the Public Participation Guidelines of the Board of Medicine and by Executive Order 25(98). As a result of its review, the board proposes amendments to clarify the use of unlicensed persons in the practice of physical therapy, to require proof of English proficiency for graduates of schools located outside the United States or Canada, to require graduates of nonapproved schools to provide documentation of certification by the Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical  Virginia Register of Regulations 58   Proposed Regulations Therapy, to establish the passing score for the examination, and to clarify certain requirements for practice and supervision of physical therapy assistants. In addition, the proposed amendments establish an inactive licensure status and those requirements for renewal or reinstatement of licensure which are necessary to protect the public health and safety in the delivery of physical therapy services. Substance: 18 VAC 85-31-10. Definitions are proposed for (i) an ""approved program"" to specify those educational programs which are accredited for licensure; (ii) ""FCCPT"" as the Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical Therapy; and (iii) ""nonlicensed personnel as an individual not licensed or certified by a health regulatory board and is performing patient care functions at the direction of a physical therapist or a physical therapist assistant. An amendment is proposed in the definition of ""inactive practice trainee"" to clarify the meaning of ""inactive"" as not having practiced for at least 320 hours within the past four years and as consistent with terminology used elsewhere in the regulations. 18 VAC 85-31-25. A new section is proposed to require licensees to furnish current name and address within 30 days of any change and to specify that notices mailed or served by the board to the name and address on file shall be validly given. 18 VAC 85-31-40. The section on educational requirements is amended to specify that graduates of approved programs outside the United States or Canada must pass the Test of English as a Foreign Language or provide proof of English proficiency. 18 VAC 85-31-50. Regulations are amended for graduates of schools which are not approved by the board to require that such applicants in physical therapy provide documentation of certification by the FCCPT as evidence of equivalency in education and training. The requirements for a foreigntrained physical therapist assistant and for a traineeship have not been amended. 18 VAC 85-31-65 has been added to specify the current requirements for an examination and to set out the minimum passing score on the exam as a scale score of 600 or a score to be established by the advisory board. 18 VAC 85-31-80. An amendment is proposed to clarify that an applicant for licensure by endorsement who has not been practicing in another jurisdiction for at least 320 hours within the four years immediately preceding application meet the requirements for a traineeship in 18 VAC 85-31-140. Other amendments in 18 VAC 85-31-80 are editorial. 18 VAC 85-31-90. Amendments are proposed to clarify that the physical therapist gets a referral for treatment from a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, podiatry or dental surgery. 18 VAC 85-31-100. An amendment is proposed to change the term ""physical therapy aide,"" which is not a category of practitioner created by statute to the term ""unlicensed personnel,"" which is defined in the regulation. An amendment is also proposed to clarify that the physical therapist shall supervise no more than three trainees at any one time. Volume 16, Issue 1 59 18 VAC 85-31-120. Amendments are intended to clarify the schedule by which a physical therapist must reevaluate a patient who is receiving treatment by a physical therapy assistant. 18 VAC 85-31-135. A new section is proposed to allow a practitioner to request an inactive license without requiring evidence of continuing practice in physical therapy. Such a license does not entitle the licensee to perform any act which would require a license to practice. The proposed amendments would also establish a fee for inactive licensure and add requirements for reinstatement of an inactive license to active status to include evidence of active practice hours in another jurisdiction equal to the number of years of inactivity and payment of the difference between the cost of an active and inactive license. An inactive licensee who cannot meet the requirement of active hours of practice must meet the requirements for a traineeship as specified in 18 VAC 85-31140. 18 VAC 85-31-140. An amendment is proposed to clarify the requirement for evidence of active practice in order to reinstate a license and to specify that a traineeship must be under the supervision of a physical therapist and to clarify who is required to do a traineeship as set forth in subsection A. The requirement for reexamination after a period of seven years of inactivity is deleted. Issues: ISSUE 1: Type and amount of continuing competency requirements. In response to the statutory mandate for the Board of Medicine to develop regulations for the assurance of the continued competency of all its licensees, the advisory board reviewed its current requirement for hours of active practice as a prerequisite for renewal of licensure. In these proposed regulations, there are no amendments for continuing education or other type of evidence of continued competency. However, the advisory board is continuing to monitor the research on continued competency, the requirements of other states, and the availability of credentialing organizations offering continued competency courses or activities. ISSUE 2: Requirements for reactivation of an inactive or lapsed license. In current regulations, there is a requirement for at least 320 hours of practice within the preceding four years in order to renew a license. The board is proposing an inactive license at a reduced renewal fee for those practitioners who want to take a leave of absence or are now out of state and have no intention of engaging in active practice in the Commonwealth. In doing so, requirements for reactivation of such a license are necessary to ensure that practitioners are competent to resume practice. The board determined that it was necessary for a practitioner whose license has been inactive to provide evidence of continuing competency hours equal to the amount of time the license has not been active. If a practitioner has not engaged in active practice during the time the license was inactive in Virginia, the board currently requires that he serve a board-approved traineeship of 480 hours under the supervision of a licensed physical therapist. Monday, September 27, 1999   Proposed Regulations Advantages or disadvantages to the licensees. The inactive licensure status will be beneficial to practitioners who are not currently living or practicing in the Commonwealth. They will be able to maintain a license at a reduced cost. If they choose to reactivate and return to practice, they will not have to apply for reinstatement or pay back renewal fees and penalty fees. They will only have to indicate that they have the required hours of active practice in another jurisdiction or have served the requisite traineeship and pay the difference between the inactive and active renewal fee. There are no disadvantages to licensees who will have the option of requesting inactive licensure. Advantages or disadvantages to the public. Inactive licensure has no significant advantages or disadvantages to the public; these are persons who are not authorized the practice physical therapy in Virginia. Inactive licensure may have a minor positive impact on access to physical therapy services in that it would be less costly and burdensome for an inactive licensee who has taken a break from professional practice or has been living out of state to return to active practice and employment in Virginia. The public is well served by a requirement for a board-approved traineeship under supervision if a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant has not been professionally active for a period of time. Such a practice will provide assurance by the observation and guidance of a licensed therapist that the applicant for licensure or relicensure has regained his ability to practice. ISSUE 3: Licensure requirements for applicants trained in foreign schools. a. Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) requirement for graduates of approved schools. Graduates of schools approved by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education of the American Physical Therapy Association are recognized by the board as having met its educational requirements for licensure. Those schools were traditionally located in the U.S. or Canada, so English proficiency was not an issue. The commission has begun approving schools in foreign countries, so the board has determined that a test of English (TOEFL) or some other proof of English proficiency is necessary. For example, if a graduate attended a school in Great Britain or a citizen of the U.S. attended a school in a foreign country, the TOEFL test would not be required. b. Documentation of certification by the Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical Therapy for graduates of nonapproved schools. As far as the board has been able to determine, the only ""nonapproved schools"" of physical therapy are located outside the United States and Canada. (The new school of physical therapy located at Shenandoah University will have accreditation completed before it graduates any students.) With foreign-trained therapists, there has been a problem throughout the U.S. with persons getting green cards or temporary occupational visas to work in this country as physical therapists who, once they get to the U.S., find that they do not meet the requirements for licensure in any state. Recent reforms in the immigration laws of the U.S. have created a requirement for internationally educated health care professionals entering the country to meet certain criteria before being granted a visa or applying for licensure. To ensure that those criteria have been met prior to entering the U.S., persons are being required to obtain prescreening certification. Through the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy, the Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical Therapy has been authorized to review credentials for the purpose of determining eligibility to be licensed as a physical therapist. The board is proposing that certification by the FCCPT be required for international candidates from nonapproved educational programs. From its review of the criteria for certification by FCCPT, the board determined that in every way its requirements met or exceeded Virginia's requirements for licensure, with one exception  the lack of a traineeship in the U.S. The board will continue to require a traineeship in Virginia to ensure through supervised practice that the foreign-trained applicant has the knowledge, skills and English proficiency to communicate with and practice safely on patients in the Commonwealth. Requiring certification by FCCPT will eliminate the need for submission to the board of documents on educational programs, equivalency of degrees, translations from embassies, proof of English proficiency, and verification of licensure status in another country. Advantages or disadvantages to the licensees. The TOEFL examination is the nationally recognized standard for determining English proficiency for internationals seeking to practice a profession in the U.S. To require a different standard would be burdensome, since the TOEFL exam is readily available at schools located in other countries. Students who can clearly demonstrate English proficiency will not be required to take the TOEFL exam. Since prescreening is required for entry into the U.S., applicants who have to get FCCPT certification will not have an unnecessary burden or barrier to licensure. The prescreening process will eliminate the unfortunate situation of a foreign-trained physical therapist sacrificing to come to the U.S. only to find that he is not eligible to sit for the examination or to become licensed in any state. Prescreening may also reduce the extremely high failure rate for foreign-trained graduates on the national licensure examination (out of the 30 foreign-trained applicants currently pending with the Board of Medicine, 27 have already failed the licensure examination at least once). Advantages or disadvantages to the public. The public is better protected by having potential licensees prescreened for their ability to practice safely in Virginia and to communicate in English with their patients. The FCCPT will authenticate the licensure status of any person who has been licensed or certified in another country, evaluate the equivalency of his degree, and ensure English proficiency. ISSUE 4: Clarification of practice responsibilities. The Code of Virginia requires a referral from a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, chiropractic, podiatry or dental surgery for treatment by a physical therapist. In 18 VAC 85-31-90, the title clearly referred to those particular practitioners, but the regulation spoke of the ""referring practitioner."" As a result,  Virginia Register of Regulations 60   Proposed Regulations there have been questions about whether a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant working for physician could make the referral as the ""referring practitioner."" An amendment will clarify the requirement and make it explicitly consistent with the Code. Currently, regulations provide for the practice and supervision of a physical therapy aide; such a category of practitioner was not created in the statute and therefore should not be created by regulation. The proposal establishes a definition for ""unlicensed personnel"" and utilizes that terminology in the regulation. Two other practice issues have been addressed to specify more clearly the requirements and policies of the board. Supervision by a physical therapist of trainees is restricted to no more than three; the proposed amendment would clarify that it means three trainees at any one time. The schedule for reevaluation by a physical therapists of a patient being treated by a physical therapist assistant has been edited for greater clarity. Advantages or disadvantages to the licensees and the public. Greater clarity in the language of the regulation will serve to ensure more consistent compliance with regulations. Licensees will not inadvertently or unintentionally violate some provision of the requirements nor will they be pressured to accept a patient from a practitioner who is not authorized by law to make such a referral. The public is better protected by regulations which are specific in their requirements for practice and for supervision of unlicensed persons working in a physical therapy pra"

[Approved by Governor October 14, 2001. Filed with Secretary of State October 14, 2001.] LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST  AB 25, Migden. Domestic partnerships. (1) Existing law establishes a cause of action for negligence, including the negligent infliction of emotional distress and a cause of action for wrongful death. This bill would make these provisions applicable to a domestic partner as well as a surviving spouse. (2) Existing law provides for the registration of domestic partnerships, as defined, and limits the legal effect of the registration of the domestic partnership to specified provisions of law. Existing law provides that persons of opposite sexes may not establish a domestic partnership unless they are both over the age of 62 and both persons meet specified eligibility criteria under the Social Security Act. This bill would expand the legal effect of the registration of a domestic partnership to any provision of law specifically referring to domestic partners. This bill would also expand the class of persons who may establish and register a domestic partnership by providing that persons of opposite sexes may establish a domestic partnership if one or both of them are over the age of 62 and one or both of them meet the specified eligibility criteria under the Social Security Act.  91   Ch. 893  --2--  (3) Existing law provides that a stepparent desiring to adopt a child of the stepparent's spouse may for that purpose file a petition in the county in which the petitioner resides and prescribes the procedure for such an adoption. This bill would authorize the employment of the procedures applicable to stepparent adoption to the adoption by a domestic partner, as defined, of the child of his or her domestic partner. (4) Under the Public Employees' Medical and Hospital Care Act, state and local employers may elect to offer health care coverage and other benefits to domestic partners of employees and annuitants, as defined; however, a domestic partner is not eligible for continued health coverage upon the death of the employee or annuitant. This bill would provide that a domestic partner, and a child of a domestic partner, shall be eligible for continued health coverage upon the death of the employee or annuitant if the domestic partner is receiving a beneficiary allowance, as specified. The bill would also prohibit a surviving domestic partner from enrolling additional family members in a health benefits plan. (5) Under the existing County Employees Retirement Law of 1937, death benefits and survivor 's allowances are payable to the surviving spouse or children of a deceased member, as specified. This bill would provide that in San Mateo County, subject to the approval of the board of supervisors, death benefits and survivor 's allowances may be payable to a member 's surviving domestic partner, as specified. (6) Existing law, the Uniform Health Care Decisions Act, allows an individual to give instructions about personal health care decisions or authorize someone else to act as a surrogate to make these decisions. This bill would authorize a domestic partner to make health care decisions on behalf of a patient in certain circumstances. (7) Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans administered by the Department of Managed Care. Under existing law, a willful violation of any of these provisions is punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor. Existing law also provides for the regulation of policies of disability insurance administered by the Insurance Commissioner. Existing law requires that health care service plans and disability insurers provide coverage for certain benefits and services. This bill would require a group health care service plan and a policy of disability insurance that provides hospital, medical, or surgical expense benefits to offer coverage to employers and guaranteed associations for a domestic partner of an employee, subscriber, insured, or policyholder to the same extent, and subject to the same terms and 91   --3--  Ch. 893  conditions, as provided to a dependent of an employee, subscriber, insured, or policyholder. The bill would also require that if an employer or guaranteed association has purchased coverage for domestic partners, a health care service plan or a policy of group disability insurance that provides hospital, medical, or surgical expense benefits for employees, subscribers, insureds, or policyholders and their dependents shall enroll as a dependent, upon application by the employer or group administrator, a domestic partner of the employee, subscriber, insured, or policyholder when that employee, subscriber, insured, or policyholder in accordance with the terms and conditions of the group contract, as specified. The bill would also provide that a health care service plan or policy of group disability insurance may require a copy of a valid Declaration of Domestic Partnership and notification of termination of the domestic partnership. Since a willful violation of the provisions applicable to health care service plans is a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. (8) Existing law requires any employer who provides sick leave to employees, as specified, to allow the employees to use the sick leave to attend to the illness of a sick child, parent, or spouse. This bill would require the employer described above to allow the employee to use sick leave to attend to an ill domestic partner or child of a domestic partner, and would make other conforming changes. (9) Existing law provides for the creation of conservatorships and trusts, and for the management of the estates of decedents. This bill would define domestic partner and surviving domestic partner for the purposes of the Probate Code. The bill would revise the provisions regarding conservatorships to provide for the participation of a domestic partner of the conservatee or proposed conservatee in these proceedings. The bill would require preference for selection of a conservator be given to the domestic partner and a person nominated by the domestic partner. The bill would require that a petition for conservatorship set forth the names and addresses of the domestic partner of the proposed conservatee or the names and addresses of any children of a predeceased domestic partner. The bill would require notice of a conservatorship hearing to be sent to the domestic partner of the proposed conservatee and would authorize the domestic partner to appear at the hearing in support or opposition to the petition. The bill would prohibit a domestic partner from petitioning for the appointment of a conservatorship of his or her domestic partner under specified conditions. This bill would also include a domestic partner within the definition of a family member for the purposes of requiring a domestic partner, when acting as a conservator or a guardian, to reveal his or her 91   Ch. 893  --4--  relationship to a ward or conservatee when petitioning a court for approval of certain property transactions. This bill also would make conforming changes. (10) Existing law prohibits a court official, employee, or a person related by blood or marriage, as defined, who is involved in the appointment of a conservator or guardian, or the processing of any document relating to a conservator or guardian, from purchasing, leasing, or renting the personal or real property from the estate of a conservatee or a ward whom the conservator or guardian represents. This bill would include a domestic partner within the definition of a person related by blood or marriage for the purposes of the provisions described above. (11) Existing law provides for the transfer of the property of a deceased person by will, and prescribes a statutory will form. Existing law provides that dissolution of a marriage revokes a bequest of property made in a will to a former spouse, among other things. This bill would provide that termination of a domestic partnership revokes a bequest of property made in a will to a former domestic partner, among other things. The bill would also revise the statutory will form to, among other things, provide for the inclusion of a domestic partner among the beneficiaries to whom the testator may indicate a desire to leave his or her principal residence, automobiles, household, and personal effects, or residuary estate. (12) Existing law provides that the surviving spouse is entitled to be appointed administrator of the decedent's estate and shall be given priority over other persons in relation to the decedent. This bill would expand the right to be appointed as administrator of a decedent's estate to children of a domestic partner and to the parents of a predeceased domestic partner and their issue. (13) The Personal Income Tax Law provides, in specified conformity to federal law, an exclusion from gross income for certain amounts expended for medical care and for certain employer-provided coverage under an accident or health plan. That law also allows a deduction for certain health insurance costs of self-employed individuals and with respect to certain group health plans. This bill would make those tax benefits available to domestic partners. (14) Existing law provides that an individual who leaves his or her work voluntarily or without good cause is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Existing law further defines good cause for these purposes, and establishes procedures and presumptions for the administration of benefits. This bill would include in the definition of good cause the act of accompanying one's domestic partner to a place from which it is 91   --5--  Ch. 893  impractical to commute and to which a transfer by the employer is not available. This bill would also make related changes. (15) Existing law provides that if a person is eligible to receive disability benefits, but is mentally unable to make a claim, the claim may be made by the spouse of the individual, and the payment shall be executed upon the affidavit of the spouse, or other qualified person, as specified. This bill would allow a domestic partner to make the claim and execute the affidavit in the capacity described above. (16) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. The people of the State of California do enact as follows: SECTION 1. Section 1714.01 is added to the Civil Code, to read: 1714.01. (a) Domestic partners shall be entitled to recover damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress to the same extent that spouses are entitled to do so under California law. (b) For the purpose of this section, ``domestic partners'' has the meaning provided in Section 297 of the Family Code. SEC. 2. Section 377.60 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to read: 377.60. A cause of action for the death of a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another may be asserted by any of the following persons or by the decedent's personal representative on their behalf: (a) The decedent's surviving spouse, domestic partner, children, and issue of deceased children, or, if there is no surviving issue of the decedent, the persons, including the surviving spouse or domestic partner, who would be entitled to the property of the decedent by intestate succession. (b) Whether or not qualified under subdivision (a), if they were dependent on the decedent, the putative spouse, children of the putative spouse, stepchildren, or parents. As used in this subdivision, ``putative spouse'' means the surviving spouse of a void or voidable marriage who is found by the court to have believed in good faith that the marriage to the decedent was valid. (c) A minor, whether or not qualified under subdivision (a) or (b), if, at the time of the decedent's death, the minor resided for the previous 180  91   Ch. 893  --6--  days in the decedent's household and was dependent on the decedent for one-half or more of the minor 's support. (d) This section applies to any cause of action arising on or after January 1, 1993. (e) The addition of this section by Chapter 178 of the Statutes of 1992 was not intended to adversely affect the standing of any party having standing under prior law, and the standing of parties governed by that version of this section as added by Chapter 178 of the Statutes of 1992 shall be the same as specified herein as amended by Chapter 563 of the Statutes of 1996. (f) For the purpose of this section, ``domestic partners'' has the meaning provided in Section 297 of the Family Code. SEC. 3. Section 297 of the Family Code is amended to read: 297. (a) Domestic partners are two adults who have chosen to share one another 's lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring. (b) A domestic partnership shall be established in California when all of the following requirements are met: (1) Both persons have a common residence. (2) Both persons agree to be jointly responsible for each other 's basic living expenses incurred during the domestic partnership. (3) Neither person is married or a member of another domestic partnership. (4) The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in this state. (5) Both persons are at least 18 years of age. (6) Either of the following: (A) Both persons are members of the same sex. (B) One or both of the persons meet the eligibility criteria under Title II of the Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 402(a) for old-age insurance benefits or Title XVI of the Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 1381 for aged individuals. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, persons of opposite sexes may not constitute a domestic partnership unless one or both of the persons are over the age of 62. (7) Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership. (8) Neither person has previously filed a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State pursuant to this division that has not been terminated under Section 299. (9) Both file a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State pursuant to this division.  91   --7--  Ch. 893  (c) ``Have a common residence'' means that both domestic partners share the same residence. It is not necessary that the legal right to possess the common residence be in both of their names. Two people have a common residence even if one or both have additional residences. Domestic partners do not cease to have a common residence if one leaves the common residence but intends to return. (d) ``Basic living expenses'' means shelter, utilities, and all other costs directly related to the maintenance of the common household of the common residence of the domestic partners.

The following is the California Statutory Will form: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS CALIFORNIA STATUTORY WILL The following information, in question and answer form, is not a part of the California Statutory Will. It is designed to help you understand about Wills and to decide if this Will meets your needs. This Will is in a simple form. The complete text of each paragraph of this Will is printed at the end of the Will. 1. What happens if I die without a Will? If you die without a Will, what you own (your ``assets'') in your name alone will be divided among your spouse, domestic partner, children, or other relatives according to state law. The court will appoint a relative to collect and distribute your assets. 2. What can a Will do for me? In a Will you may designate who will receive your assets at your death. You may designate someone (called an ``executor'') to appear before the court, collect your assets, pay your debts and taxes, and distribute your assets as you specify. You may nominate someone (called a ``guardian'') to raise your children who are 91   -- 37 --  Ch. 893  under age 18. You may designate someone (called a ``custodian'') to manage assets for your children until they reach any age between 18 and 25. 3. Does a Will avoid probate? No. With or without a Will, assets in your name alone usually go through the court probate process. The court's first job is to determine if your Will is valid. 4. What is community property? Can I give away my share in my Will? If you are married and you or your spouse earned money during your marriage from work and wages, that money (and the assets bought with it) is community property. Your Will can only give away your one-half of community property. Your Will cannot give away your spouse's one-half of community property. 5. Does my Will give away all of my assets? Do all assets go through probate? No. Money in a joint tenancy bank account automatically belongs to the other named owner without probate. If your spouse, domestic partner, or child is on the deed to your house as a joint tenant, the house automatically passes to him or her. Life insurance and retirement plan benefits may pass directly to the named beneficiary. A Will does not necessarily control how these types of ``nonprobate'' assets pass at your death. 6. Are there different kinds of Wills? Yes. There are handwritten Wills, typewritten Wills, attorney-prepared Wills, and statutory Wills. All are valid if done precisely as the law requires. You should see a lawyer if you do not want to use this statutory Will or if you do not understand this form. 7. Who may use this Will? This Will is based on California law. It is designed only for California residents. You may use this form if you are single, married, a member of a domestic partnership, or divorced. You must be age 18 or older and of sound mind. 8. Are there any reasons why I should NOT use this statutory Will? Yes. This is a simple Will. It is not designed to reduce death taxes or other taxes. Talk to a lawyer to do tax planning, especially if (i) your assets will be worth more than $600,000 or the current amount excluded from estate tax under federal law at your death, (ii) you own business-related assets, (iii) you want to create a trust fund for your children's education or other purposes, (iv) you own assets in some other state, (v) you want to disinherit your spouse, domestic partner, or descendants, or (vi) you have valuable interests in pension or profit-sharing plans. You should talk to a lawyer who knows about estate planning if this Will does not meet your needs. This Will treats most adopted children like natural children. You should talk to a lawyer if you have stepchildren or foster children whom you have not adopted.  91   Ch. 893  -- 38 --  9. May I add or cross out any words on this Will? No. If you do, the Will may be invalid or the court may ignore the crossed out or added words. You may only fill in the blanks. You may amend this Will by a separate document (called a codicil). Talk to a lawyer if you want to do something with your assets which is not allowed in this form. 10. May I change my Will? Yes. A Will is not effective until you die. You may make and sign a new Will. You may change your Will at any time, but only by an amendment (called a codicil). You can give away or sell your assets before your death. Your Will only acts on what you own at death. 11. Where should I keep my Will? After you and the witnesses sign the Will, keep your Will in your safe deposit box or other safe place. You should tell trusted family members where your Will is kept. 12. When should I change my Will? You should make and sign a new Will if you marry, divorce, or terminate your domestic partnership after you sign this Will. Divorce, annulment, or termination of a domestic partnership automatically cancels all property stated to pass to a former husband, wife, or domestic partner under this Will, and revokes the designation of a former spouse or domestic partner as executor, custodian, or guardian. You should sign a new Will when you have more children, or if your spouse or a child dies, or a domestic partner dies or marries. You may want to change your Will if there is a large change in the value of your assets. You may also want to change your Will if you enter a domestic partnership or your domestic partnership has been terminated after you sign this Will. 13. What can I do if I do not understand something in this Will? If there is anything in this Will you do not understand, ask a lawyer to explain it to you. 14. What is an executor? An ``executor'' is the person you name to collect your assets, pay your debts and taxes, and distribute your assets as the court directs. It may be a person or it may be a qualified bank or trust company. 15. Should I require a bond? You may require that an executor post a ``bond.'' A bond is a form of insurance to replace assets that may be mismanaged or stolen by the executor. The cost of the bond is paid from the estate's assets. 16. What is a guardian? Do I need to designate one? If you have children under age 18, you should designate a guardian of their ``persons'' to raise them. 17. What is a custodian? Do I need to designate one? A ``custodian'' is a person you may designate to manage assets for someone (including a child) who is between ages 18 and 25 and who receives assets under your Will. The custodian manages the assets and pays as much as the 91   -- 39 --  Ch. 893  custodian determines is proper for health, support, maintenance, and education. The custodian delivers what is left to the person when the person reaches the age you choose (between 18 and 25). No bond is required of a custodian. 18. Should I ask people if they are willing to serve before I designate them as executor, guardian, or custodian? Probably yes. Some people and banks and trust companies may not consent to serve or may not be qualified to act. 19. What happens if I make a gift in this Will to someone and they die before I do? A person must survive you by 120 hours to take a gift under this Will. If they do not, then the gift fails and goes with the rest of your assets. If the person who does not survive you is a relative of you or your spouse, then certain assets may go to the relative's descendants. 20. What is a trust? There are many kinds of trusts, including trusts created by Wills (called ``testamentary trusts'') and trusts created during your lifetime (called ``revocable living trusts''). Both kinds of trusts are long-term arrangements where a manager (called a ``trustee'') invests and manages assets for someone (called a ``beneficiary'') on the terms you specify. Trusts are too complicated to be used in this statutory Will. You should see a lawyer if you want to create a trust. 21. What is a domestic partner? You have a domestic partner if you have met certain legal requirements and filed a form entitled ``Declaration of Domestic Partnership'' with the Secretary of State. Notwithstanding Section 299.6 of the Family Code, if you have not filed a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State, you do not meet the required definition and should not use the section of the Statutory Will form that refers to domestic partners even if you have registered your domestic partnership with another governmental entity. If you are unsure if you have a domestic partner or if your domestic partnership meets the required definition, please contact the Secretary of State's office. INSTRUCTIONS 1. READ THE WILL. Read the whole Will first. If you do not understand something, ask a lawyer to explain it to you. 2. FILL IN THE BLANKS. Fill in the blanks. Follow the instructions in the form carefully. Do not add any words to the Will (except for filling in blanks) or cross out any words. 3. DATE AND SIGN THE WILL AND HAVE TWO WITNESSES SIGN IT. Date and sign the Will and have two witnesses sign it. You and the witnesses should read and follow the Notice to Witnesses found at the end of this Will.  91   Ch. 893  -- 40 --  NOTE TO PRINTING OFFICE: INSERT CAMERA-READY COPY HERE for California Statutory Will as printed on pages 17 to 22 of Chapter 1055, 1991 Statutes.  91   -- 41 --  Ch. 893  91   Ch. 893  -- 42 --  91   -- 43 --  Ch. 893  91   Ch. 893  -- 44 --  91   -- 45 --  Ch. 893  91   Ch. 893  -- 46 --  SEC. 53.

If the employer is entitled to a ruling under subdivision (b) or to a determination under Section 1328, the department shall promptly notify the employer of its ruling as to the cause of the termination of the claimant's employment. The employer may appeal from a ruling or reconsidered ruling to an administrative law judge within 20 days after mailing or personal service of notice of the ruling or reconsidered ruling. The 20-day period may be extended for good cause, which includes, but is not limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The director is an interested party to any appeal. The department may for good cause reconsider any ruling or reconsidered ruling within either five days after the date an appeal to an administrative law judge is filed or, if no appeal is filed, within 20 days after mailing or personal service of notice of the ruling or reconsidered ruling.

The presumption provided by this section is rebuttable. An individual whose employment is terminated under the compulsory retirement provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer is a party, shall not be deemed to have left his or her work without good cause. An individual may be deemed to have left his or her most recent work with good cause if he or she leaves employment to accompany his or her spouse or domestic partner to a place from which it is impractical to commute to the employment. For purposes of this section ``spouse'' includes a person to whom marriage is imminent. An individual may be deemed to have left his or her most recent work with good cause if he or she leaves employment to protect his or her children, or himself or herself, from domestic violence abuse. An individual shall be deemed to have left his or her most recent work with good cause if he or she elects to be laid off in place of an employee with less seniority pursuant to a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that provides that an employee with more seniority may elect to be laid off in place of an employee with less seniority when the employer has decided to lay off employees. SEC. 60. Section 2705.1 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to read: 2705.1. Where an individual who would be eligible to receive disability benefits is mentally unable to make a claim therefor, the director shall, in accordance with authorized regulations, allow the filing of a claim for these benefits by the spouse or domestic partner of the individual, in the absence of any other legally authorized representative of the individual. A payment shall be made upon affidavit executed by the spouse or domestic partner or person or persons claiming to be entitled to the benefits and the receipt of the affidavit or affidavits shall fully discharge the Director of Employment Development from any further liability with reference to the payments, without the necessity of inquiring into the truth of any of the facts stated in the affidavit. For the purposes of this section ``mentally unable to make a claim'' shall be limited to those cases in which the individual is certified by a healing arts practitioner specified in Sections 2708 and 2709 to be mentally unable to make a claim pursuant to this part. SEC. 61. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the 91   -- 51 --  Ch. 893  only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

The rule is necessary to ensure that bell jar games are distributed and played in accordance within constitutional and statutory limits as they apply to charitable gaming; that bell jar licensing and financial reporting procedures are established; that the sale and use of bell jar vending machines are conducted in accordance with constitutional and statutory limits; and that veterans' organizations are exempt from the Board requirement that one-third of their charitable gaming funds be donated to other charities. Legal Basis for the Rule: General Municipal Law Article 9-A 186, 188-a, 189, 189-a, 195-c, 195-f, 195-n. 195-0,195-p, 195-q and 195-r. Assessment of Public Comment: No comments were received.

(CITE 26 SR 967)  State Register, Tuesday 22 January 2002  PAGE 967   Minnesota Rules: Amendments and Additions NOTICE: How to Follow State Agency Rulemaking in the State Register The State Register is the official source, and only complete listing, for all state agency rulemaking in its various stages. State agencies are required to publish notice of their rulemaking action in the State Register. Published every Monday, the State Register makes it easy to follow and participate in the important rulemaking process. Approximately 80 state agencies have the authority to issue rules. Each agency is assigned specific Minnesota Rule chapter numbers. Every odd-numbered year the Minnesota Rules are published. The current 1999 set is a 13-volume bound collection of all adopted rules in effect at the time. Supplements are published to update this set of rules. Generally speaking, proposed and adopted exempt rules do not appear in this set because of their short-term nature, but are published in the State Register. An agency must first solicit Comments on Planned Rules or Comments on Planned Rule Amendments from the public on the subject matter of a possible rulemaking proposal under active consideration within the agency (Minnesota Statutes  14.101). It does this by publishing a notice in the State Register at least 60 days before publication of a notice to adopt or a notice of hearing, or within 60 days of the effective date of any new statutory grant of required rulemaking. When rules are first drafted, state agencies publish them as Proposed Rules, along with a notice of hearing, or a notice of intent to adopt rules without a hearing in the case of noncontroversial rules. This notice asks for comment on the rules as proposed. Proposed emergency rules and withdrawn proposed rules are also published in the State Register. After proposed rules have gone through the comment period, and have been rewritten into their final form, they again appear in the State Register as Adopted Rules. These final adopted rules are not printed in their entirety in the State Register, only the changes made since their publication as Proposed Rules. To see the full rule, as adopted and in effect, a person simply needs two issues of the State Register, the issue the rule appeared in as proposed, and later as adopted. For a more detailed description of the rulemaking process, see the most current edition of the Minnesota Guidebook to State Agency Services. The State Register features partial and cumulative listings of rules in this section on the following schedule: issues #1-13 inclusive; issues #1425 inclusive; issue #26 cumulative for issues #1-26; issues #27-38 inclusive; issue #39, cumulative for issues #1-39; issues #40-51 inclusive; and issues #1-52 (or 53 in some years), cumulative for issues #1-52 (or 53). An annual subject matter index for rules was separately printed usually in August, but starting with Volume 19 now appears in the final issue of each volume. For copies or subscriptions to the State Register, contact Minnesota's Bookstore, 117 University Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55155 (612) 297-3000, or toll-free 1-800-657-3757.

It does this by publishing a notice in the State Register at least 60 days before publication of a notice to adopt or a notice of hearing, and within 60 days of the effective date of any new statutory grant of required rulemaking.  Rules to be Adopted After a Hearing After receiving comments and deciding to hold a public hearing on the rule, an agency drafts its rule. It then publishes its rules with a notice of hearing. All persons wishing to make a statement must register at the hearing. Anyone who wishes to submit written comments may do so at the hearing, or within five working days of the close of the hearing. Administrative law judges may, during the hearing, extend the period for receiving comments up to 20 calendar days. For five business days after the submission period the agency and interested persons may respond to any new information submitted during the written submission period and the record then is closed. The administrative law judge prepares a report within 30 days, stating findings of fact, conclusions and recommendations. After receiving the report, the agency decides whether to adopt, withdraw or modify the proposed rule based on consideration of the comments made during the rule hearing procedure and the report of the administrative law judge. The agency must wait five days after receiving the report before taking any action.  Rules to be Adopted Without a Hearing Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes  14.22, an agency may propose to adopt, amend, suspend or repeal rules without first holding a public hearing. An agency must first solicit Comments on Planned Rules or Comments on Planned Rule Amendments from the public. The agency then publishes a notice of intent to adopt rules without a public hearing, together with the proposed rules, in the State Register. If, during the 30-day comment period, 25 or more persons submit to the agency a written request for a hearing of the proposed rules, the agency must proceed under the provisions of  14.14-14.20, which state that if an agency decides to hold a public hearing, it must publish a notice of intent in the State Register.

A copy of the proposed rules is published in the State Register and attached to this notice as mailed. Comments.

If the proposed rules affect you in any way, you are encouraged to participate in the rulemaking process. Cancellation of Hearing. The hearing scheduled for March 4, 2002, will be canceled if the agency does not receive requests from 25 or more persons that a hearing be held on the rules. If you requested a public hearing, the agency will notify you before the scheduled hearing whether or not the hearing will be held. You may also call the agency contact person at (952) 496-7950 after February 20, 2002 to find out whether the hearing will be held. Notice of Hearing. If 25 or more persons submit valid written requests for a public hearing on the rules, a hearing will be held following the procedures in Minnesota Statutes, sections 14.131 to 14.20.

Hearing Procedure. If a hearing is held, you and all interested or affected persons, including representatives of associations or other interested groups, will have an opportunity to participate. You may present your views either orally at the hearing or in writing at any time before the close of the hearing record. All evidence presented should relate to the proposed rules.

No additional evidence may be submitted during the five-day response period. All comments and responses submitted to the Administrative Law Judge must be received at the Office of Administrative Hearings no later than 4:30 p.m. on the due date. All comments or responses received will be available for review at the Office of Administrative Hearings. This rule hearing procedure is governed by Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.2000 to 1400.2240, and Minnesota Statutes, sections 14.131 to 14.20. Questions about procedure may be directed to the Administrative Law Judge. The agency requests that any person submitting written views or data to the Administrative Law Judge prior to the hearing or during the comment or rebuttal period also submit a copy of the written views or data to the agency contact person at the address stated above. Statement of Need and Reasonableness. A statement of need and reasonableness is now available from the agency contact person.

The statement may also be reviewed and copies obtained at the cost of reproduction from the agency. Lobbyist Registration. Minnesota Statutes, chapter 10A, requires each lobbyist to register with the State Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board. Questions regarding this requirement may be directed to the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board at: Suite 190, Centennial Building, 658 Cedar Street, St. Paul, Minnesota 55155, phone: (651) 296-5148 or 1-800-657-3889.

Subpart 1. Interruption of the audio/visual satellite signal from host racetrack. In the event of an interruption of both the audio and video satellite signal from the host racetrack, the guest track's mutuel manager must: A. notify the tote wagering hub or host track of the loss of the signal; and B. notify the presiding official or designated commission representative of the interruption. The licensee track may continue to accept wagering on the balance of the program and subsequent programs until the satellite downlink has been reestablished, if the wagering hub has an audio/visual feed from the host track and the on-track public is notified by public announcement. If the audio and video interruption will not be corrected before the end of the host track's racing program, betting must be stopped for the races that will not be televised but all advanced wagers must be honored. If the initial audio or visual signal is not established, the guest track must make an announcement to the public and stop betting until the signals are established. All advanced wagers made without an audio or video signal must be honored. Subp. 1a. Disruption of communication between Class A facility and alternative facility. In the event that the communications between the Class A facility and the alternative facility fails, the Class B licensee must: A. notify the alternative facility operator, the designated racing commission representative, and the wagering patrons that an interruption in communication has occurred; and B. immediately begin to execute back-up procedures to reestablish communication between the Class A and alternative facility. Subp. 2. Wagering interface interruption when Class A facility is guest racetrack. A. In the event the guest totalizator system fails to transfer the data to the host system, the guest mutuel manager must notify either the host mutuel department or the host tote system representatives and the designated commission representative of the interruption. If necessary, the guest mutuel manager will make a request to the host track for additional time to attempt a retransmission of the data or a manual merge before going official.

If the attempted retransfer of data fails, the tote or mutuel representatives shall notify the stewards or the designated commission representative that the transfer has failed and that the pools must be merged manually. If for any reason it becomes impossible to successfully merge, electronically or manually, the bets placed into the host track pool, the guest track shall make payouts in accordance with host track prices or refunds as described in subpart 4b. Subp. 2a. Wagering interface interruption when Class A facility is host racetrack. If the host mutuel manager determines that a guest track has not transmitted its pools to the host track in a timely manner or if a manual merge jeopardizes the integrity of the host track's pools, delays the host track's program, or a manual merge is attempted and failed, the guest track must be excluded from the wagering pools. A. In the event of a manual merge: (1) The guest tote system operator must inform the host tote system operator of the total amount in the pool, the total dollars on winning wagers, and the total dollars on the losing wagers in the pool. The guest tote system operator shall send that information via a facsimile machine to the host tote system; (2) The stewards at the host racetrack and the presiding official at the guest racetrack must be notified when the procedure has been completed in order to declare the race official; (3) The licensee's tote system representative shall prepare a report indicating that the transfer of data could not be completed electronically and that the pools were merged manually.

C. The guest track may continue to accept wagering on the balance of the program on a separate or manually merged commingled pool basis. D. Any wager on subsequent programs prior to reestablishment of computer interface may be either canceled, or the pools calculated on a separate basis (no commingling), or manually merged on a commingled pool basis. Subp. 3. [See repealer.] Subp. 4. [See repealer.] Subp. 4a. [See repealer.] Subp. 4b. Procedures for paying host track prices. A. In the event that wagers are not accepted at the host track, the guest track shall pay the host track prices on affected singlerace pools. The funds derived from the wagers shall be applied to the payment of the affected winning tickets.

Underpayments may be used to offset overpayments generated during a calendar year. Any resulting surplus at the close of wagering on December 31st of a calendar year must be added into a net wagering pool, chosen by the association and approved by the commission in accordance with part 7873.0110, subpart 3, on the first live racing day of the following meet. If there is a deficit at the close of wagering on December 31st of a calendar year, that deficit will be the starting point for which the following year's cumulative total begins. The mutuel department or tote representative or both must submit to the commission a complete report of payments made to winning ticket holders resulting in any surplus or liability. This report must also summarize the yearly total of accumulated surpluses and liabilities. This report must be submitted to the commission within 48 hours of the failure. B.

Department of Administration Office of Technology Notice of the Technology Enterprise Board Meeting NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the Minnesota Department of Administration and the Office of Technology are holding a Technology Enterprise Board meeting. It will be a facilitated meeting to clearly established the Board's roles and responsibilities. The meeting date/ time and location are: January 29, 2002 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Embassy Suites Hotel 175 East 10th Street St. Paul, MN  Department of Human Services Community Supports for Minnesotans with Disabilities Public Notice Regarding a Medical Assistance Targeted Case Management Rate NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN to recipients, providers of services, and to the public of a new proposed rate under the Medical Assistance Program for targeted case management services provided to vulnerable adults and adults with mental retardation or related conditions. This notice is published pursuant to Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part 447, section 205 (42 CFR 447.205), which requires public notice of significant proposed changes in methods and standards for setting payment rates for feefor-service Medical Assistance services. Laws of Minnesota 2001, First Special Session, chapter 9, article 2, sections 39 (Minnesota Statutes, 256B.0625, subd. 43) and 44 (Minnesota Statutes, 256B.0924) add targeted case management services to the Medical Assistance benefit set. In addition, for adults with mental retardation or related conditions, targeted case management services must meet the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, 256B.092. Effective January 23, 2002, Medical Assistance will cover targeted case management services provided to vulnerable adults in need of adult protection as defined in Minnesota Statutes, 626.5572, subd. 21 and adults with mental retardation as defined in Minnesota Statutes 252A.02, subd. 2 or related conditions as defined in Minnesota Statutes, 252.27, subd. 1a, who are not receiving home and community-based waiver services. These persons must be 18 years of age or older, receiving Medical Assistance, have significant functional limitations, and be in need of service coordination to attain or maintain living in integrated community settings. Targeted case management services will be coordinated on an individual client basis and will be designed to help individuals gain access to needed medical, social, educational, financial, housing and other services and supports necessary to meet their needs. These may include: developing an individual service plan; assisting clients in obtaining needed formal and informal supports; coordinating services to ensure continuity of care; monitoring and evaluating individual service plans; routine communication with clients, their families, legal representatives, caregivers, service providers, and others; completing and maintaining necessary records; travel; referrals to health care programs and programs providing other assistance; and identification of other possible home and community-based services. On July 16, 2001 at 26 State Register 58, the Department published notice of these new Medical Assistance targeted case management services. The notice stated that providers would be paid a monthly rate. Specifically:  The 2001 legislation requires that for calendar year 2002, the rate for county providers will be the same as the rate for adult mental health case management (Rule 79) in effect as of December 31, 2001. This rate is based on the amount of time spent on Rule 79 case management as documented though the Social Service Time Study, number of clients served, and total county expenses as documented by the Social Service Cost Pool in the Social Service Fund (Schedule 2556.1). The State Register, Tuesday 22 January 2002 (CITE 26 SR 978)  PAGE 978   Official Notices rate methodology and rate formula for Rule 79 targeted case management are available by contacting Christopher Ricker (see below). After 2002, the rate will be based on the monthly rate methodology established using time study data on activities of provider service staff and reports, calculated as one combined average rate together with Rule 79 targeted case management.  The 2001 legislation requires that the rate for entities contracting with counties will be based on a monthly rate negotiated by host counties. If the service will be provided by a team of contracted entities, counties may negotiate a team rate with an entity that is a member of the team. The team will determine how to distribute the payment among its members. The Department anticipates that from January 23, 2002 through June 30, 2002 (approximately the last six months of State Fiscal Year 2002) the total Medical Assistance costs will be $6,385,439 (of which $3,192,719 will be county costs) and that from July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003 (State Fiscal Year 2003) the total Medical Assistance costs will be $12,699,361 (of which $6,349,680 will be county costs).

(h) ""Cotenant"" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident. (i) ""Disposable income"" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended prior to January 1, 1994, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income: (i) Capital gains, other than nonrecognized gain on the sale of a principal residence under section 1034 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, or gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal Internal Revenue Code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence; (ii) Amounts deducted for loss; (iii) Amounts deducted for depreciation; (iv) Pension and annuity receipts; (v) Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vi) Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments; (vii) Federal Social Security Act and railroad retirement benefits; (viii) Dividend receipts; and (ix) Interest received on state and municipal bonds.

(q) ""Refinancing"" means the discharge of an existing debt with funds obtained through the creation of new debt.  For purposes of this section, even if the application for tax exempt bond financing to refinance existing debt is treated by the financing agent as something other than refinancing, an application for a property tax exemption because of refinancing by tax exempt bonds will be treated as refinancing and the set-asides specific to refinancing will be applied.  ""Refinancing"" shall include tax exempt bond financing in excess of the amount of existing debt that is obtained to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge a facility currently being operated as a home. (r) ""Rehabilitation"" means that an existing building or structure, not currently used as a home, will be modified, improved, restored, extended, or enlarged so that it will be used as a home for elderly and disabled individuals.  A project will be considered a rehabilitation if the costs of rehabilitation exceed five thousand dollars.  If a home has acquired tax exempt bond financing and does not meet the definition of ""rehabilitation"" contained in this subsection, the home may be eligible for a total exemption under the ""refinancing"" definition and if it meets the ""refinancing"" set-aside requirements.  If such a home is not eligible for a total exemption, the department will determine the home's eligibility for a partial exemption in accordance with the pertinent parts of  RCW 84.36.041  and this section. (s) ""Set-aside(s)"" means the percentage of dwelling units reserved for low-income residents when the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a financing program using tax exempt bonds.

(v) ""Total amount financed"" means the total amount of financing required by the home to fund construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, or refinancing.  Seventy-five percent of this amount must be supplied by tax exempt bonds to receive the total exemption from property tax available under the tax exempt bond financing provision of  RCW 84.36.041 . (3)  General requirements.   To be exempt under this section, a home for the aging must be: (a) Exclusively used for the purposes for which exemption is granted, except as provided in  RCW 84.36.805 ; (b) Operated by an organization that is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code; and (c) The benefit of the exemption must inure to the home. (4)  Total exemption.   There are three ways in which a home may be totally exempt from property tax.  All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt if it meets the general requirements listed in subsection (3) of this section and: (a) At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents; (b) The home is subsidized under a HUD program; or (c) The construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents.  See subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this section for tax exempt bond requirements and the percentage of units that must be set-aside for low-income residents in order for the home to be totally exempt. (5)  Homes or CCRCs financed by tax exempt bonds--Generally.   All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home or CCRC may be totally exempt from property tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed for construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing uses tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home or CCRC to reserve or set-aside a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents. (a) The percentage of set-aside units required will vary depending on whether the home is a CCRC, the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained, the type of dwelling unit, and the receipt of Medicaid funds.  The set-aside requirements for homes are set forth in subsection (6) of this section and for CCRCs are set forth in subsection (7) of this section. (b) The exemption will be granted in direct correlation between the total amount financed by tax exempt bonds and the portion of the home or CCRC that is constructed, acquired, rehabilitated, or refinanced by tax exempt bonds. (c) If tax exempt bonds are used for refinancing, the set-aside requirements set forth in subsections (6) and (7) of this section will be applied to the actual area or portion of the home or CCRC to which the bonds correspond. (i) Example 1.  A CCRC (that accepts Medicaid funds) is composed of a multistory building, six duplexes, and two independent homes and the CCRC has secured tax exempt bonds to satisfy an existing mortgage on the multistory building.  Only the multistory building will be considered eligible for a total exemption from property tax because of tax exempt bond financing. To receive the exemption, at least twenty percent of the dwelling units of the multistory building must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income or at least forty percent of the dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. (ii) Example 2.  A home obtains tax exempt bonds to refinance a portion of the home and to fund construction.  The department will separately consider the area of the home that corresponds to the purpose for which the tax exempt bonds were obtained.  The set-aside requirements related to refinancing will be applied to the portion of the home that corresponds to the mortgage being refinanced and the set-aside requirements related to construction will be applied to the area of the home to be newly constructed.  The department will determine the eligibility for partial exemption of the remainder of the home that is not being refinanced or constructed. (d) If a total exemption is granted under the tax exempt bond financing provision, the total exemption will remain in effect as long as: (i) The home or CCRC remains in compliance with the requirements under which it received the tax exempt bonds; (ii) The tax exempt bonds are outstanding; and (iii) The set-aside requirements are met. (e) If a home or CCRC has obtained tax exempt bond financing to modify, improve, restore, extend, or enlarge its existing facility and the project does not meet the definition of rehabilitation contained in subsection (2) of this section, the project will not be considered a rehabilitation and the set-aside requirements related to refinancing or acquisition will be applied in determining eligibility for a total exemption. (f) When a home or CCRC no longer meets the criteria for exemption under the tax exempt bond financing portion of the statute, eligibility for exemption under  RCW 84.34.041  will be determined by the other provisions of the statute.  In other words, a home may receive a total or partial exemption depending on the number of residents who are deemed to be ""eligible residents"" or who require ""assistance with activities of daily living.""  For example, if a home that previously received a total exemption due to the receipt of tax exempt bond financing has one hundred dwelling units and sixty of those dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, the home may receive a total exemption. (6)  Set-aside requirements related to homes and tax exempt bond financing.   A specified number of dwelling units within a home must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for homes will be determined according to the type of dwelling units contained in the home and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to CCRCs.  The specific set-aside requirements for CCRCs are described in subsection (7) of this section. (( (a) Complete and separate dwelling units - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a home with any complete and separate units, the following set-asides will apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. (b) Complete and separate dwelling units - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire or refinance a home with any complete and separate units, the following set-asides will apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. (c) Shared dwelling units - construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing.  If financing was obtained for the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of a home with only shared units, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. ))  A home must meet the following set-aside requirements to be totally exempt from property tax: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING TYPE OF DWELLING UNIT SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation Complete  Separate units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units   currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements Complete  Separate units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements Complete  Separate units 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income Acquisition, New Construction, Refinancing,  or  Rehabilitation Shared units 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income (7)  Set-aside requirements related to CCRCs and tax exempt bond financing.    A specified number of dwelling units of a CCRC must be set-aside for low income residents to obtain a total property tax exemption because of tax exempt bond financing.  The set-aside requirements for CCRCs will be determined by whether the CCRC does or does not have Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents and the purpose for which the tax exempt bond financing was obtained.  The provisions of this section do not apply to other homes.  The specific set-aside requirements for other homes are described in subsection (6) of this section. (a) The continuing care contract between the resident and the CCRC is a contract to provide shelter along with nursing, medical, health-related or personal care services to the resident for the duration of the resident's life or for a term in excess of one year.  A resident's tenancy may not be terminated due to inability of the resident to fully pay the monthly service fee when the resident establishes facts to justify a waiver or reduction of these charges.  This provision shall not apply if the resident, without the CCRC's consent, has impaired his and/or her ability to meet financial obligations required by the continuing care contract due to a transfer of assets, after signing the continuing care contract, other than to meet ordinary and customary living expenses, or by incurring unusual or unnecessary new financial obligations. (b) A CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents may not receive Medicaid funds from Washington state or the federal government during the term that the bonds are outstanding, except during the initial transition period as allowed by state law or if the regulatory agreement with the tax exempt bond financier exempts the CCRC from compliance with this requirement. (c)  The following set-aside requirements must be met by  CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) (( - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Fifteen percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below one hundred percent of the local median income. (d) CCRCs not receiving Medicaid funds (including CCRCs that are permitted to receive Medicaid funds during an initial transition period only) - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire a CCRC or to refinance a CCRC without Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. ))  to receive a total exemption: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 15%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 15% set-aside requirements 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income (( (e) ))  (d) The following set-aside requirements must be met by  CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds((  - construction or rehabilitation.  If financing was obtained for the construction or rehabilitation of a CCRC with Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Ten percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below eighty percent of the local median income; and (ii) Ten percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below fifty percent of the local median income. (f) CCRCs receiving Medicaid funds - acquisition or refinancing.  If financing was obtained to acquire a CCRC or to refinance a CCRC with Medicaid contracts for continuing care contract residents, the following set-asides apply: (i) Twenty percent of the total dwelling units financed must be set-aside for residents with incomes at or below fifty percent of the local median income; or (ii) Forty percent of the total dwelling units must be set-aside for residents at or below sixty percent of the local median income. ))  to receive a total exemption: PURPOSE OF BOND FINANCING SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENTS New construction  or  Rehabilitation 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 80% of local median income  and 10%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 100% of local median income Acquisition  or  Refinancing of dwelling units  not currently satisfying  10% and 10% set-aside requirements 20%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 50% of local median income  or 40%  of total units set-aside for residents at or below 60% of local median income (8)  Partial exemption.   If a home does not qualify for a total exemption from property tax, the home may receive a partial exemption for its real property on a unit by unit basis and a total exemption for its personal property. (a) Real property exemption.  If the real property of a home is used in the following ways, the portion of the real property so used will be exempt and the home may receive a partial exemption for: (i) Each dwelling unit occupied by a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living; (ii) Each dwelling unit occupied by an eligible resident; and  (iii) Common or shared areas of the home that are jointly used for two or more purposes that are exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW . (b) Assistance with activities of daily living.  A home may receive a partial exemption for each dwelling unit that is occupied by a resident who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and the home provides, brokers, facilitates, or contracts for the provision of this assistance.  A resident requiring assistance with the activities of daily living must be a resident who requires significant assistance with at least three of the nonexclusive list of activities set forth below and who, unless he or she receives the assistance, would be at risk of being placed in a nursing home.  Activities of daily living include, but are not limited to: (i) Shopping; (ii) Meal and/or food preparation; (iii) Housekeeping; (iv) Transportation; (v) Dressing; (vi) Bathing; (vii) General personal hygiene; (viii) Monitoring of medication;  (ix) Ambulatory services; (x) Laundry services; (xi) Incontinence management; and (xii) Cuing for the cognitively impaired. (c) Examples of assistance with the activities of daily living: (i) If the resident of a home requires someone to assist him or her with daily dressing, bathing, and personal hygiene, weekly housekeeping chores, and daily meal preparation, he or she is a resident requiring significant assistance with activities of daily living and the home may receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit in which he or she resides. (ii) If the resident of a CCRC only requires someone to clean his or her house weekly and to do the laundry weekly, the resident does not require significant assistance with activities of daily living and the CCRC may not receive a partial exemption for the dwelling unit. (d) Common or shared areas.  Areas of a home that are jointly used for two or more purposes exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW  will be exempted under  RCW 84.36.041 . (i) The joint use of the common or shared areas must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property tax under  chapter 84.36 RCW .  A kitchen, dining room, and laundry room are examples of the types of common or shared areas for which a partial property tax exemption may be granted.  (ii) Example.  A nonprofit organization uses its facility as a home for the aging and a nursing home.  The home and nursing home jointly use the kitchen and dining room.  The home may receive a property tax exemption for the common or shared areas under  RCW 84.36.041 .  The eligibility of the other areas of the facility will be determined by the appropriate statute.  The home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.041  and the nursing home's eligibility will be determined by  RCW 84.36.040 . (e) Amount of partial exemption.  The amount of partial exemption will be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, minus/less the assessed value of any common or shared areas, by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction is the number of the dwelling units occupied on January 1st of the assessment year by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living.  The denominator of the fraction is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of January 1st of the assessment year.  Example: Assessed value of home: $500,000 Less assessed value of common area:   - 80,000 Total $420,000 Number of units occupied on 1/1 by  eligible residents and people requiring assistance with daily living activities =  Total of occupied units on 1/1  6 40 or .15 $420,000 x .15= $63,000  Amount of partial exemption $420,000 - $63,000= $357,000  Taxable value of home (f) Valuation of the home.  The assessor will value a home that receives a partial exemption by considering only the current use of the property during the period in which the partial exemption is received and will not consider any potential use of the property. (9)  Income verification required from some residents.   If a home seeks a total property tax exemption because at least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents or seeks to receive a partial exemption based upon the number of units occupied by eligible residents, the residents must submit income verification forms.  The department may request income verification forms from residents of homes receiving a total exemption because of tax exempt bond financing. (a) The income verification forms must be submitted to the assessor of the county in which the home is located by July 1st of the assessment year in which the application for exemption is made. (b) The income verification form will be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. (c) If an eligible resident filed an income verification form for a previous year, he or she is not required to submit a new form unless there is a change in status affecting the resident's eligibility, such as a significant increase or decrease in disposable income, or the assessor or the department requests a new income verification form to be submitted. (10) (( Three-year phase in for a home with increased taxable value.   If the taxable value of a home is increased because of the change in the method of calculating the amount of partial exemption, the increased taxable value shall be phased in over a period of three years. (a) Eligibility requirements for phase in.  If the home meets the following conditions the increased taxable value may be phased in: (i) The home was exempt or partially exempt for taxes levied in 1993 for collection in 1994; (ii) The home is partially exempt for taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995; and (iii) The taxable value of the home increased for taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995 due to the change prescribed by chapter 151, Laws of 1993 with respect to the numerator of the fraction used to determine the amount of partial exemption. (b) Method of phase in.  The increase in taxable value shall be phased in as follows: Column 1 Year Column 2 Value after partial exemption Column 3 Increase in Value (Col. 2 minus TV from Prior Year) Column 4 Annual % of Increase  to be Paid Column 5 Amount of Increase to be Paid (Col. 3 x Col 4) Column 6 Taxable Value (""TV"") (Col. 5 +TV from Prior Year) 1993 $292,300      $292,300 1994 $357,000*  $64,700 33.00% $21,351 $313,651 1995 $336,000** $22,349 50.00% $11,175 $324,826 1996 $325,500   $674    100.00%  $674     $325,500 1997 $367,500      $367,500 * This value is a continuation of the example in subsection (8)(e) of this section. ** For the purposes of this example, we are assuming that the home is located in a county on a four year revaluation cycle and that value of this home after the partial exemption will fluctuate each year because the number of eligible residents and residents who require assistance with the activities of daily living will change each year.  In this example, the number of units exempt from property tax within the home used in the example in subsection (8)(e) are as follows:  Eight in 1995, nine in 1996, and five in 1997. (i) For taxes levied in 1994 for collection in 1995, the home will pay taxes based on the taxable value in 1993 plus one-third of the increase in the taxable value from 1993 to the taxable value calculated under subsection (8)(e) of this section. (ii) For taxes levied in 1995 for collection in 1996, the home will pay taxes based on the taxable value in 1994 plus one-half of the increase in the taxable value from 1994 to the taxable value calculated under subsection (8)(e) of this section. (iii) For taxes levied in 1996 for collection in 1997 and for taxes levied thereafter, this subsection does not apply and the home will pay taxes on the taxable value without reference to this subsection. (c) Example:  Assume, for the purposes of this example, in 1993 the assessed value of a home was $475,000, the value of the shared area was $80,000, and twenty-six percent of the units were exempt.  Therefore, the assessed value minus the value of the shared area or $395,000 multiplied by .74= a taxable value of $292,300. (11) ))  Additional requirements.   Any nonprofit home for the aging that applies for a property tax exemption under this section must also comply with the provisions of  WAC 458-16A-020  and 458-16-165.   WAC 458-16A-020  contains information regarding the initial application and renewal procedures relating to the exemption discussed in this section.   WAC 458-16-165  sets forth additional requirements that must be complied with to obtain a property tax exemption pursuant to  RCW 84.36.041 .
