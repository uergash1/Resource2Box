In Minnesota, the 3-year (1998-2000) poverty rate for the total population was 7.8 percent. Minnesota's poverty rate was lower than the comparable U.S. rate of 11.9 percent. In the U.S., women and children were over three-quarters (75.6%) of persons in poverty. Women age 18 years and over represented 3 of 5 (61.1%) adults in poverty.

Women have higher rates of poverty than men in all age groups. In 2000, over 1 in 6 U.S. women age 18 to 24 years were in poverty, the highest rate of all age groups. Poverty rates of both women and men were lowest for those age 45 to 54 years.  5%  0% under 18 18 to 24 25 to 34 35 to 44 45 to 54 55 to 64 65 to 74 75 and over  The disparity in poverty rates between women and men was greatest for those age 25 to 34 years and those age 75 years and over. In 2000, poverty rates of women in these age groups were 1.7 times higher than the rates of their male counterparts. The disparity in poverty rates between the sexes was smallest for those under age 18 years and for those age 45 to 54 years.  U.S. Poverty Rates by Educational Attainment and Sex Poverty rates decrease as educational attainment increases. Over one-quarter (26.0%) of U.S. women age 25 years and over with educational attainment of less than a high school diploma were in poverty in 2000. The rate dropped by more than one-half for women with a high school diploma (10.9%). Women with no high school diploma had a poverty rate that was 8 percentage points higher than their male counterparts.

Median age of first marriage decreased significantly after 1940 and was lowest in 1950 and 1960. Since 1960, median age of first marriage has increased for both sexes. In 2000, the age was 25.1 years for women and 26.8 years for men.  Marital Status of Women by Age The marital status of U.S. women varies widely by age. In 2000, 84.7 percent of women age 15 to 24 years were never married. In comparison, 13.0 percent of women age 35 to 44 years were never married. The percentage of women who were never married decreases as age increases and remains relatively constant for those age 55 years and over. In 2000, the proportion of women who were married was highest for women age 35 to 44 years. Similar proportions of women age 45 to 54 years and age 55 to 64 years were married. In 2000, approximately 7 in 10 women age 35 to 64 years were married. In 2000, over 3 in 10 women age 65 to 74 years and 6 in 10 women age 75 years and over were widowed. The proportion of women who were widowed increased significantly after age 45 to 54 years.

From July 1, 1999 - June 30, 2000, 47,475 homeless people were served by the 134 facilities in 55 counties that received Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program funding.  Approximately 3,400 homeless people were sheltered each day by these 134 facilities.  Of the 47,475 people served during that period:            64 percent were single adult males and females,          23 percent were children between ages birth to seventeen years,           36 percent were members of families,           8 percent were veterans.

Genealogists find census particularly useful for tracing family lines or histories in the state. Historians find them useful for local history information. Social scientists find them useful for demographics, ethnic studies,etc. Federal census records date from 1790 and continue every 10th year. As a general rule the information in each successive census is progressively more detailed. The schedules for the period 1790-1840 show the names of enumerated heads of families only, and others in the household are tallied by characteristics (age groups, sex, and race). All subsequent enumerations, however, list each individual in a household by name. The most recent census available at the archives is 1920. Because they contain personal information, census records can only be released 72 years after their creation. Separately created indices are available in book form for the years up to and including 1870. After this point the researcher can use the Soundex indexing system, available on microfilm, to access the census. Described below is the information that is relevant for certain census years.     1790 Delaware's federal census for this year was recreated by tax assessments     1800-1840 indexed by household head     1850-1870 1850 census began to include names of individuals other than household head     1880, 1900, 1920 indexed by the Soundex system, explained below     1890 census records for Delaware were destroyed by fire     1910 this census was not indexed for the state of Delaware, so you must know where an individual lived to then search through enumeration districts.     Special Census Records              Delaware Public Archives houses various federal special census. Mortality schedules, created in 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1880, enumerate name and description of deceased (age, sex, race, marital status); place of birth; month of death; profession, occupation, or trade; cause of death; and number of days ill. The 1880 mortality schedules include father and mother’s birthplace and name of the attending physician. Slave schedules enumerate slave owners and number of slaves for the years 1850 and 1860. These schedules include  description of slaves (age, sex, color); if slaves are fugitives from the state; manumitted;  and deaf and dumb, blind, insane, or idiotic. The 1860 slave schedules also include  number of slave houses. Agriculture schedules, created in1850 through 1880, enumerate  name of owner, agent, or manager of the farm; number of acres on the farm (improved or unimproved); value of farm and equipment; kind and number of livestock; total value of all     livestock; kind and quantity of produce for the year; and value of animals slaughtered. The 1870 and 1880 schedules include total amount of wages paid during the year and the value of board, as well as estimated value of all farm production (sold, consumed, or on hand)             Industry schedules, created in 1850, 1860, and 1870, enumerate name of corporation, company, or individual, producing articles to the annual value of $500; name of business, manufacture, or product; capital investment; raw material used (quantities, kinds, values); source of power (hand, water, wind, steam, horse); number of employees (male and female); wages; and annual product (quantities, kinds, values). In 1880, the manufacturer schedule began including such operations as agricultural implements; paper mills; boot and shoe factories; lumber and sawmills; brick yards and file works; flour and grist mills; cheese, butter, and condensed milk factories; slaughtering and meat-packing; salt works; and distilleries. The schedule also includes wages and hours of labor; months in operation; power used (hand, water, steam, wind, horse); types and quantities of materials and supplies involved in manufacturing; value of materials and supplies; and finished products and by-products produced.             Social statistics schedules, created in 1850, 1860, and 1870, enumerate overall conditions of the state’s welfare, such as: valuation of estate (real and personal); annual taxes (types, amount, method of payment); colleges, academies, and schools (type of   school, number of teachers, number of pupils, amounts received from taxes, public funds, or other sources); seasons and crops (crops that came up short, extent of shortage, average crop); libraries (number of library edifices, type of ownership and number of   volumes); newspapers and periodicals (name, character [political or social view], how often published, circulation); religion (number of church edifices, maximum   accommodation, value of church); pauperism (name of division, number of native and foreign paupers supported through the year, total number of native and foreign paupers as of June 1st, amount of cost of support); crime (number of natives and foreigners incarcerated as of June 1st); and wages (average wages of a farm laborer with board, day-laborer with and without board, day wages to a carpenter without board, weekly wages of     female domestic with board, and price of board to laboring men per week).             In 1880, the format of social statistics schedules was altered to include more information about paupers and indigent inhabitants, homeless children, and inhabitants who were incarcerated, insane, idiotic, deaf-mutes and/or blind. The schedules show type of physical or personal disability, page and line reference to population schedule, name and location of inhabitant, reason or cause for being institutionalized, date of discharge, and whether inhabitant is self-supporting.           How to Use the Soundex Coding System     On-line users can access the National Archives  SOUNDEX Machine  for an on-line conversion utility.     If the full name of an individual is known, and if he/she was the head of a household in Delaware, one will be able to search for them in the 1880, 1900, and 1920 federal census records by using the Soundex coding index system. The 1880 Soundex index included only those families that had a member aged 10 or younger. The 1900 and 1920 Soundex system indexed every family by head (including single individuals), and thus included the entire population.     To search for a particular surname, the Soundex code must be used. The Soundex system was developed so that a surname can be found, although it may have various spellings. Each Soundex code consists of a letter and 3 numbers. An example of this coding is B650-this is the Soundex code for the last name ""Brown"". The letter in the Soundex code is always the first letter of the last name. The numbers are made from the remaining letters of the last name. There must always be 3 numbers in the code. Zeros are added if the coding falls short of the 3 required digits.     Steps for Soundex Coding     1. Write out the name you are searching.     2. Below it, begin coding by writing the first letter of the name as your lead.     3. Start assigning numbers to the remaining letters in the order you come to them, using these guidelines:     The number represents the letter               1 - B P F V             2 - C S K G J Q X Z             3 - D T             4 - L             5 - M N             6 - R       Do not code A, E, I, O, U, W, Y, and H.     4. If you have finished coding the name and do not have three numbers, add zeros to complete the coding.     Helpful Hints     Names with prefixes, such as VanDorpe, may have been coded with or without the prefix. Code it both ways to be sure (Mc and Mac are not considered prefixes). Letters that are side by side that have the same coding must be treated as one letter. Also note that although the initial letter does not receive a number code, you must consider its coding when assigning the first number. If they receive the same number, disregard the coding and go on to the next letter.     Example: Pfisk P200     Using the Code in the Census     Once you have coded the name correctly, you can use the coding in the microfilmed Soundex card index to find a reference for a census page. The Soundex index is broken down by state, coded number, and alphabetically by first name of the individual. There may be several names and codes grouped together. Check for the first name you need and then scan the codes until you find the individual you need. You can confirm that you have the right individual by checking the information available on the index card. Listed are other family members or individuals in the same household, and information such as race, age, place of residence, etc. Once you find the individual's card, copy all of the information in the top right-hand corner. These four numbers will direct you to the actual census page. ""Vol."" refers to the volume, ""E.D."" to the enumeration district, and the ""sheet"" and ""line"" references further direct you to the specific individual in the census. Using the enumeration district reference will direct you to the specific reel needed to see the actual census page.     SOUNDEX WORKSHEET     1. Spell the surname with a letter within each box:     2. Write the first letter of the surname:     3. Cross out the remaining letters of the surname that will not receive a number code, and write out those that can be coded in the first set of boxes below. In the second set of boxes, write the number that corresponds to the letter, as taken from the chart. letter: number: Limit the amount of numbers to three. If there are more than three, remove the excess; if it falls short, add zeros to add up to three.     4. Write out the first letter of the code and the three numbers you derived from the name. This is the Soundex code that will allow you to search for the name of an individual in the 1880, 1900, and 1920 census.

GX069-50-1659751	"OVERVIEW     Current Population Survey     Introduction      The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of the official Government statistics on employment and unemployment. The CPS has been conducted monthly for over 50 years. Currently, we interview about 48,000 households monthly, scientifically selected on the basis of area of residence to represent the Nation as a whole, individual States, and other specified areas. Each household is interviewed once a month for four consecutive months one year, and again for the corresponding time period a year later. This technique enables us to obtain month-to-month and year-to-year comparisons at a reasonable cost while minimizing the inconvenience to any one household.     Although the main purpose of the survey is to collect information on the employment situation, a very important secondary purpose is to collect information on the demographic status of the population, information such as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, and family structure. From time to time additional questions are included on such important subjects as health, education, income, and previous work experience. The statistics resulting from these questions serve to update similar information collected once every 10 years through the decennial census, and are used by Government policymakers and legislators as important indicators of our Nation's economic situation and for planning and evaluating many Government programs.     The CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of the population of the United States. Because it is not possible to develop one or two overall figures (such as the number of unemployed) that would adequately describe the labor market, the CPS is designed to provide a large amount of detailed and supplementary data. Such data are made available to meet a wide variety of needs on the part of users of labor market information.     Thus, the CPS is the only source of monthly estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm); nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid workers in nonfarm family enterprises; wage and salary employees; and, finally, estimates of total unemployment.     It provides the only available distribution of workers by the number of hours worked (as distinguished from aggregate or average hours for an industry), permitting separate analyses of part-time workers, workers on overtime, etc. The survey is also the only comprehensive current source of information on the occupation of workers and the industries in which they work. Information is available from the survey not only for persons currently in the labor force but also for those who are outside the labor force. The characteristics of such persons -- whether married women with or without young children, disabled persons, students, older retired workers, etc., can be determined. Information on their current desire for work, their past work experience, and their intentions for job seeking are also available.     The March CPS, also known as the Annual Demographic File, contains the basic monthly demographic and labor force data described above, plus additional data on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration.     CPS Sample      The CPS sample is based on the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. The sample is located in 792 sample areas comprising 2,007 counties and independent cities with coverage in every State and in the District of Columbia.     In all, some 60,000 housing units or other living quarters are assigned for interview each month; about 48,000 of them containing approximately 94,000 persons 15 years old and over are interviewed. Also included are demographic data for approximately 28,000 children 0-14 years old and 450 Armed Forces members living with civilians either on or off base within these households. The remainder of the assigned housing units are found to be vacant, converted to nonresidential use, contain persons with residence elsewhere, or are not interviewed because the residents are not found at home after repeated calls, are temporarily absent, or are unavailable for other reasons. Approximately 12,000 noninterview households are present each month. The resulting file size is approximately 136,000 records. In March of each year supplemental data are collected for Armed Forces members residing with their families in civilian housing units or on a military base. The Armed Forces members, however, are not asked the monthly labor force questions. In addition, the March CPS is supplemented with a sample of Hispanic households identified the previous November. This results in the addition of about 3,000 households (2,500 Interviewed) in the March CPS. The inclusion of the additional sample of Hispanic households began in 1976.     A more precise explanation regarding the CPS sample design is provided in Technical Paper 40,  The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology.      For a more detailed discussion about the basic labor force data gathered on a monthly basis in the CPS survey, see the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report No. 463 and the Current Population Report P-23, No. 62, issued jointly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census in October, 1976, and entitled Concepts and Methods Used In Labor Statistics derived from the Current Population Survey.     Questionnaire      Questionnaire facsimiles of the March 1996 CPS income supplement are shown in Appendix D in this documentation.     Revisions To The March CPS Processing System      Introduction . Between 1988 and 1989 a new computer processing system was introduced for the March Current Population Survey. This processing system rewrite was long overdue; the system in use before this year was first introduced in March 1976 and was never fully updated to reflect the numerous questionnaire changes that had taken place since that time. In addition, the programs used to process the CPS file were written in a computer language that is being phased out of use at the Census Bureau. While the March 1989 file is the first to reflect this new processing system, the March 1988 file was reprocessed based on these new procedures in order to: 1) better evaluate the new processing procedures, and 2) allow year-to-year comparisons to be made between income years 1987 and 1988 using a consistent processing system.     While the following section deals mainly with modifications to the March imputation procedures and their subsequent effect on income and poverty rates, it should be pointed out that all of the processing programs were rewritten in 1989, so that not only are the files from 1989 forward based on a somewhat different imputation system, but also reflect a rewritten weighting system, data acceptance program, family relationship edits, and new procedures to match income supplement records to the monthly CPS file. As a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether differences (especially those based on relatively small bases) are the result of imputation or other processing differences between the original and revised files.     Since the Census Bureau began imputing the missing income data on the CPS in 1962, there have been three major revisions to the processing system (in 1967, 1976, and 1989). Through all of these revisions, the basic strategy used in make imputations has remained the same. This approach, commonly referred to as ""hot deck"" imputation, assigns missing responses to sample persons with information from matched sample persons with similar demographic and economic information who answered these questions.     Under the new March processing system, there were three main modifications to the income imputation programs:        1. The edits and imputations were expanded to reflect the full detail of the March   income questionnaire. The original processing system was still based on a less detailed   CPS income questionnaire that had not been in use since 1980.      2. Under the revised processing procedures, entire sets of March income and noncash   benefits data were imputed to supplement noninterviews from the same interviewed person.   Under the original processing procedures, earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits   were imputed in separate stages during the processing system. Thus, the new processing   system imputes noninterviews more efficiently and is better able to preserve the   correlation between earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits.      3. Both the old and new processing systems employ what are called ""statistical   matches"" to link sample cases with reported data to those requiring imputation for   missing responses. In the original processing system, under certain circumstances,   reported data were removed and replaced with imputed data during the statistical matching   process. Under the new system, reported data are never removed. This was accomplished by   expanding the number of statistical matches in the income imputation system.       File Structure      There is a household record for each household or group quarters. The household record is followed by one of three possible structures:        A. If the household contains related persons and is not a group quarters household:        1. The family record appears next followed by person records for members of the family     who are not also members of a related subfamily. The person records would be ordered:     family householder, spouse of family householder, children in the family, and other     relatives of the family householder.        2. The above records may be followed by one or more related subfamily records, each     related subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of that     related subfamily. The person records would be ordered: reference person of the related     subfamily, spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily reference     person.        3. The above records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily records, each     unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of     that unrelated subfamily. The person records would be ordered: unrelated subfamily     reference person, spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily     reference person.        4. The above records may be followed by one or more persons living with nonrelatives     family records, each to be followed by the person record for the unrelated individual it     represents. (See Figure 1, page 2-4.)          B. If the household contains a householder with no relatives and is not a group   quarters household:        1. The family record for the nonfamily householder is followed immediately by the     person record for that nonfamily householder.        2. These records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily records, each     unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by the person records for members of     that unrelated subfamily.        3. These records may be followed by one or more family records for persons living with     nonrelatives, each person living with nonrelatives family record being followed     immediately by the person record for that person living with nonrelatives. (See Figure 2,     page 2-5.)          C. If the household is a group quarters, each person is defined as a person living with   nonrelatives. There will be a family record followed by a person record for each person in   the group quarters.       Relationship of Current Population Survey Files to Publications      Each month, a significant amount of information about the labor force is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Employment and Earnings and Monthly Labor Review Reports.     As mentioned previously, the CPS also serves as a vehicle for supplemental inquiries on subjects other than employment which are periodically added to the questionnaire. From the basic and supplemental data the Bureau of the Census issues four series of publications under the general title Current Population Reports:     P-20 Population Characteristics  P-23 Special Studies   P-27 Farm Population   P-60 Consumer Income       Of particular interest to users of the March microdata file would be those reports based on information collected in March. These reports include the following titles:     P-20 Population Profile of the United States: (Year)   P-20 Household and Family Characteristics: March (Year)   P-20 Households, Families, Marital Status, and Living Arrangements: March (Year)   P-20 Geographical Mobility (Years)   P-20 Educational Attainment in the United States (Years)  P-20 Persons of Hispanic Origin in the United States (Year)       P-60 Money Income and Poverty Status of Families and Persons in the United States: (Year)  P-60 Characteristics of the Population Below the Poverty Level: (Year)   P-60 Characteristics of Households Receiving Selected Noncash Benefits: (Year)       All Current Population Reports may be obtained by subscription from the U.S. Government Printing Office.

NOTE:  Each person in group quarters is by definition a person living with nonrelatives.      Geographic Limitations      One set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files should be treated with caution. These are estimates for individual metropolitan areas. Although estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth, should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000) should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling variability associated with these estimates. For these areas, estimates comparing percent distributions and ratios will provide data with less sampling variability than estimates of levels will.     It should be kept in mind that the sample design and methods of weighting CPS data are geared towards producing estimates for the entire Nation. Consequently, data for states are not as reliable as national data, and the file will lose some of its utility in certain applications. For further discussion of such considerations, the user should consult  The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology  (Technical Paper 40, U.S. Bureau of the Census).     The nature of the work done by each individual investigator using the microdata file will determine to what extent his/her requirements for precision will allow using some of the smaller geographic areas identified on the file.     Weights      For all CPS data files a single weight is prepared and used to compute the monthly labor force status estimates. An additional weight was prepared for the earnings universe which roughly corresponds to wage and salary workers in the two outgoing rotations. This is explained below in the section on earnings data. However, the difference in content of the March CPS supplement requires the presentation of additional weights: a household weight, a family weight, and a March supplement weight. In this section we briefly describe the construction and use of these weights. Chapter 5 of Technical paper 40, The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology provides documentation of the weighting procedures for the CPS both with and without supplement questions.     The final weight, which is the product of several adjustments, is used to produce population estimates for the various items covered in the regular monthly CPS. This weight is constructed from the basic weight for each person, which represents the probability of selection for the survey. The basic weight is adjusted for special sampling situations and failure to obtain interviews from eligible households (noninterview adjustment). A two-stage ratio estimation procedure adjusts the sample population to the known distribution of the entire population. This two-stage ratio estimation process produces factors which are applied to the basic weight (after the special weighting and noninterview adjustments are made) and results in the final weight associated with each record. In summary, the final weight is the product of: (1) the basic weight, (2) adjustments for special weighting, (3) noninterview adjustment, (4) first stage ratio adjustment factor, and (5) second stage ratio adjustment factor. This final weight should be used when producing estimates from the basic CPS data.     Differences in the questionnaire, sample and data uses for the March CPS supplement result in the need for additional adjustment procedures to produce what is called the March supplement weight. The sample for the March CPS supplement is expanded to include male members of the Armed Forces who are living in civilian housing or with the family on a military base, as well as additional Hispanic households which are not included in the monthly labor force estimates.     The expanded sample and the need to have a husband and wife receive the same weight has resulted in a weighting system which produces the March supplement weight. The March supplement weight should be used for producing estimates from March supplement data.     Finally, household and family weights are the weights assigned from the householder or reference person after all adjustments have been made and should be used when tabulating estimates of families-households.     Earnings Data      Beginning in 1982, usual hourly and weekly earnings data appear on the Annual Demographic File (ADF) for that portion of the population roughly corresponding to wage and salary workers (self-employed persons in incorporated businesses are excluded, although they are normally included with the wage and salary population). These data are now collected on a monthly basis in the two outgoing rotation groups as part of the basic CPS labor force interview.     Since the intent of the regular collection of earnings data was to initiate a family earnings data series, all persons in the two outgoing rotations receive an ``earnings weight,'' even if they are not eligible for the earnings item. The earnings weight is a simple ratio-estimation to the person's labor force status by age, race, and sex. When tabulating estimates of earnings based on basic CPS data, use the earnings weight.     Further information on this earnings series is contained in  Technical Description of the Quarterly Data on Weekly Earnings from the Current Population Survey,  BLS Report #601, July 1980. This report is available on request from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, D.C. 20212. Attn: Office of Inquiries and Correspondence.     NOTE: For 1982 and 1983, usual weekly earnings are not present for individuals who were not paid on an hourly basis.

EST Tuesday, February 25, 2003  UNION MEMBERS IN 2002 In 2002, 13.2 percent of wage and salary workers were union members, down from 13.4 percent (as revised) in 2001, the U.S. Department of Labors Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The number of persons belonging to a union fell by 280,000 over the year to 16.1 million in 2002. The union membership rate has steadily declined from a high of 20.1 percent in 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available. Some highlights from the 2002 data are:  Men were more likely to be union members than women.  The union membership rate for blacks was unchanged and remained higher than the rates for either whites or Hispanics.  Nearly 4 in 10 government workers were union members in 2002, compared with less than 1 in 10 workers in private-sector industries. The transportation industry had the highest privatesector rate of unionization.  Nearly two-fifths of workers in protective service occupations were union members in 2002. Protective service occupations include firefighters and police officers. This group has had the highest union membership rate of any broad occupation group in every year since 1983. Membership by Industry and Occupation In 2002, workers in the public sector had a union membership rate over four times that of private-sector employees, 37.5 percent compared with 8.5 percent. The unionization rate for government workers has held steady since 1983. The rate for private industry workers has fallen by nearly half over the same time period. Within government, local government workers had the highest union membership rate, 42.8 percent. This Changes in Union Membership Estimates Estimates for 2001 and 2002 presented in this release are based on Census 2000 population controls. Consequently, the estimates for 2001 appearing in this release may differ from those published earlier, which were based on population controls derived from the 1990 census. In addition, the data on represented by unions incorporate a minor change to the allocation procedure for that item. The change in procedure had a small effect on the estimates. Estimates for 2001 and 2002 are not strictly comparable with estimates for earlier years. For further information on these changes, see the Technical Note.   2  group includes the heavily unionized occupations of teachers, police officers, and firefighters. Among private industries, transportation had the highest union membership rate, at 23.8 percent. Construction and durable goods manufacturing also had higher-than-average rates, at 17.2 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively. The industry with the lowest unionization rate in 2002 was finance, insurance, and real estate1.9 percent. (See table 3.) Among occupational groups, protective service workers continued to have the highest unionization rate in 2002, at 37.0 percent. Precision production, craft, and repair workers and operators, fabricators, and laborers also had higher-than-average union membership rates at 20.7 percent and 19.1 percent, respectively. Workers in these occupations typically are employed in the highly unionized industries of manufacturing and construction. Professional specialty workers, a group that includes teachers, also had a higher-than-average union membership rate in 2002, at 19.2 percent. Sales occupations had the lowest unionization rate3.6 percent. (See table 3.) Demographic Characteristics of Union Members In 2002, union membership rates were higher for men (14.7 percent) than for women (11.6 percent). The union membership rate for men fell from 15.0 percent in 2001, while the rate for women was unchanged. The gap between mens and womens rates has narrowed considerably since 1983, when the rate for men was 10 percentage points higher than the rate for women. Blacks were more likely to be union members (16.9 percent) than either whites (12.8 percent) or Hispanics (10.5 percent). Black men had the highest unionization rate (18.2 percent) among the major demographic groups, and Hispanic women and white women had the lowest rates, 9.8 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively. Union membership rates were highest among workers between the ages of 45 to 54 years. Full-time workers were more than twice as likely as part-time workers to be union members. (See table 1.) Union Representation of Nonmembers About 1.7 million wage and salary workers were represented by a union on their main job in 2002, while not being union members themselves. (See table 1.) Over half of these workers were employed in government and about 20 percent worked in the services industry. (See table 3.) Earnings In 2002, full-time wage and salary workers who were union members had median usual weekly earnings of $740, compared with a median of $587 for wage and salary workers who were not represented by unions. (See table 2.) The difference reflects a variety of influences in addition to coverage by a collective bargaining agreement, including variations in the distributions of union members and nonunion employees by occupation, industry, firm size, or geographic region. (For a discussion of the problem of differentiating between the influence of unionization status and the influence of other worker characteristics on employee earnings, see Measuring union-nonunion earnings differences, Monthly Labor Review, June 1990.) Union Membership by State Union membership rates in many states also declined slightly in 2002, with 33 states and the District of Columbia reporting lower membership rates and 15 states registering increases. Two states reported no change in their union membership rates from 2001 to 2002. Twenty-eight states had union membership rates below that of the U.S., while 21 states and the District of Columbia had higher rates. Once again, all states in the East North Central, Middle Atlantic, and Pacific divisions had union membership rates above   3  the national average of 13.2 percent, while all states in the East South Central and West South Central divisions had rates below it. (See table 5 and chart 1.) Four states had union membership rates over 20.0 percent in 2002New York (25.3 percent), Hawaii (24.4 percent), Alaska (24.3 percent), and Michigan (21.1 percent). This is the same rank order as in 2001. All four states have had rates above 20.0 percent every year since data became regularly available in 1995. North Carolina and South Carolina also continued to report the lowest union membership rates, 3.2 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. These two states have had the lowest union membership rates each year since the state series became available. The largest numbers of union members lived in California (2.5 million), New York (2.0 million), and Illinois (1.1 million). Over half (8.1 million) of the 16.1 million union members in the U.S. lived in six states, although these states accounted for only 35 percent of wage and salary employment nationally. The number of union members in a state depends on both its population size and union membership rate. Texas (the second most populous state) had less than one-fourth as many union members as New York (the third largest), despite having nearly 1.0 million more wage and salary employees. Similarly, Florida (the fourth largest state) and Indiana (the fourteenth) had virtually the same number of union members, even though Floridas wage and salary employment level was more than double that of Indiana.   Technical Note The estimates in this release are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provides the basic information on the labor force, employment, and unemployment. The survey is conducted monthly for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau from a scientifically selected national sample of about 60,000 households. The union membership and earnings data are tabulated from one-quarter of the CPS monthly sample and are limited to wage and salary workers. Excluded are all self-employed workers. The estimates for 2001 and 2002 presented in this release incorporate two changes. Consequently, the estimates for 2001 appearing in this release may differ from those previously published, and the estimates for 2001 and 2002 are not strictly comparable with estimates for earlier years. One change is the use of Census 2000-based population controls in the estimation process for both the 2001 and 2002 data. Sample results from the CPS are weighted up to independent estimates of the population by sex, age, race, and Hispanic/non-Hispanic origin. The weights, or population controls, are developed using counts of the civilian noninstitutional population derived from the decennial census and are updated using information from administrative records. Previously published estimates of union membership in 2001 were based on population controls from the 1990 census. For a discussion of the introduction of Census 2000 population controls and the impact their introduction had on CPS data, see Revisions to the Current Population Survey Effective in January 2003 in the February 2003 issue of Employment and Earnings and available at http://www.bls.gov/cps/rvcps03.pdf on the BLS Web site. Second, the data on represented by unions incorporate a minor change to the allocation procedure for that item. The change in procedure had a small effect on the estimates. Information in this release will be made available to sensory impaired individuals upon request. Voice phone: 202-691-5200, TDD message referral phone number: 1-800-877-8339. Reliability of the estimates Statistics based on the CPS are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample, rather than the entire population, is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The exact difference, or sampling error, varies depending upon the particular sample selected, and this variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. There is about a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because of sampling error. BLS analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. The CPS data also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of the population, inability to obtain information for all respondents in the sample, inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct information, and errors made in the collection or processing of the data. For a full discussion of the reliability of data from the CPS and information on estimating standard errors, see the Explanatory Notes and Estimates of Error section of Employment and Earnings. Definitions The principal definitions used in this release are described briefly below. Union members. Data refer to members of a labor union or an employee association similar to a union. Represented by unions. Data refer to union members, as well as workers who have no union affiliation but whose jobs are covered by a union or an employee association contract. Usual weekly earnings. Data represent earnings before taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders). Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term usual is as perceived by the respondent. If the respondent asks for a definition of usual, interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months. Median earnings. The median is the amount which divides a given earnings distribution into two equal groups, one having earnings above the median and the other having earnings below the median. The estimating procedure places each reported or calculated weekly earnings value into $50-wide intervals which are centered around multiples of $50. The actual value is estimated through the linear interpolation of the interval in which the median lies. Wage and salary workers. Workers who receive wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or piece rates. The group includes employees in both the private and public sectors but, for the purposes of the union membership and earnings series, excludes all self-employed persons, regardless of whether or not their businesses are incorporated. Full-time workers. Workers who usually work 35 hours or more per week at their sole or principal job. Part-time workers. Workers who usually work fewer than 35 hours per week at their sole or principal job. Hispanic origin. Refers to persons who are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Hispanic origin or descent. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; hence, they are included in the numbers for the white and black populations.   Table 1.

GX257-33-9386611	Effect on Benefits of Earnings at Ages 65 or Older, 1995 by Bertram Kestenbaum, Michael Shackleford, and Chris Chaplain* A major policy issue for the Social Security program is the treatment of earnings of persons who have attained retirement age. This article discusses the retirement test and recomputation of benefit provisions, and provides statistical data for 1995. In 1995, about 806,000 persons aged 65-70 had significant earnings resulting in the withholding of benefits by the retirement test. About 1,659,000 persons aged 65 or older realized an increase in their benefit amount because of their earnings.  *Office of the Chief Actuary, Social Security Administration.  One of the most controversial issues for the Social Security program is the effect on benefits of earnings after the attainment of normal retirement age, currently age 65. The primary object of the controversy is the retirement earnings test, the provision by which benefits are withheld from otherwise eligible persons before their 70th birthday, when their annual earnings exceed the stated threshold; benefits are withheld from their auxiliaries as well. Also controversial, though less so, is the provision for recomputation of benefits, whereby the benefit level is not fixed by career earnings up to the year of attainment of age 65; rather, earnings afterwards are also considered in redetermining the benefit amount. Dissatisfaction with the earnings test led to the enactment of P.L. 104-121 in March 1996. The new law increases the threshold slightly for each year through 2000, but raises it quite substantially for 2001, and again for 2002. The Office of the Chief Actuary estimated that the legislation would cost about $6 billion over the period 1996-2002. The average annual long-range cost of the legislation, in contrast, is quite small; as will be explained later, benefit amounts not paid because of the earnings test are generally paid out when the beneficiary is older. This article focuses on the effects on benefit payments of earnings in 1995 in and after the year of attainment of age 65, since 1995 is the latest year for which data were substantially complete. The article describes beneficiaries aged 65-70 with benefits withheld in 1995 because of significant postentitlement earnings, and updates information on this subject that has periodically appeared in the Bulletin. In fact, certain comparisons will be made between this 1995 study and the most recently published study, for 1989. However, this article contains information not given in the series of previous studies. Those studies should be consulted for a discussion of the rationale for and history of the test, as well as for historical statistics.  4  Social Security Bulletin  Vol. 62  No. 1  1999   For an analysis of the labor force impacts of the test, see, for example, The Effects of the Social Security Earnings Test on the Labor-Market Activity of Older Americans: A Review of the Evidence, that appears in the May 1990 issue of the Bulletin.  The Earnings Test: Concept and Operation In 1995, earnings during the year above a threshold of $11,280 for beneficiaries of calendar ages 65-70 (that is, 1995 minus year of birth, regardless of birth month) led to the witholding of Social Security benefits at the rate of $1 of benefits for every $3 of earnings. Thus, if an aged beneficiarys earnings during 1995 were greater than the sum of $11,280 and three times the total yearly benefit subject to the test, no benefits were payable unless other beneficiaries in the family were affected or 1995 was a grace year for the beneficiary. If earnings were less, each months full benefit was withheld until the first month in which earnings were less than the sum of $11,280 and three times the accumulated monthly benefits, for which typically a partial benefit was paid. This annual test applies to earnings in the United States even if they are earned in employment not covered by the program, as well as to covered earnings outside the United States. (Noncovered earnings outside the United States are subject to a monthly test, and are not discussed in this article.) Certain special payments which are taxable for FICA purposes in the year of receipt are nonetheless excluded from the retirement earnings test in that year. Included are payments not truly for work, such as retirement pay and certain sick pay, and payments for work for years different from those in which the payments were received, such as deferred compensation. Earnings in and after the month of attainment of age 70 are also excluded from the test. Before the recent legislation, increases in the threshold amount were indexed to the movement of average wages in the economy. Under P.L. 104-121, however, the threshold rose to $12,500 in 1996, $13,500 in 1997, $14,500 in 1998, and $15,500 in 1999. It is scheduled to rise to $17,000 in 2000. Then it will escalate to $25,000 in 2001 and to $30,000 in 2002. The magnitude of the increase can be appreciated by recognizing that $30,000 in 2002 corresponds (after indexing backwards with a series of annual average wages projected to 2002) to about $22,800 in 1995about double the 1995 threshold. There is also an earnings test for beneficiaries at calendar age 64 or younger, characterized by a lower threshold ($8,160 in 1995) and a higher withholding rate ($1 for $2). The earnings test at ages younger than 65 is, however, not as controversial, and, in fact, was ignored by recent legislation. Above-threshold earnings of retired workers are also applied, at the same withholding rate, against the benefits of any of their auxiliary beneficiaries. Above-threshold earnings of auxiliaries or survivors themselves are applied only against their own benefits. (An exception to the earnings test, known as the facility-of-payment provision, is made in the case of certain working auxiliaries whose withheld benefits would  otherwise be redirected to other family members, but this exception is rare among working auxiliaries aged 65 or older. The facility-of-payment provision was repealed effective January 1, 1996.) It should be noted that an auxiliary who works can lose benefits on account of both his earnings and the primary beneficiarys earnings, if the primary beneficiary also works. In dual-entitlement situations, that is, when a person is entitled to both a worker benefit and a larger auxiliary or survivor benefit, the earnings test operates as follows: If the earner above the threshold is the one dually entitled, both benefits are affected. If the dually entitled person is the auxiliary of the earner above the threshold, only the persons auxiliary benefits are affected. In the grace year, a monthly test applies in addition to the yearly one. Thus, regardless of the yearly amount, benefits are paid during the grace year for any nonservice monththat is, any month in which wage earnings are below 1/12th of the annual threshold ($940 in 1995) and no substantial selfemployment is performed. A grace year is generally the first year in which an entitled beneficiary has a nonservice month. For any month in which an individual between the ages of 65 and 70 does not receive any of the retired-worker benefit for which he is eligible, he earns a Delayed Retirement Credit (DRC). The DRC represents a percentage increase to the benefit the worker (or his widow) can receive, and is effective beginning in January of the following year. For workers attaining age 65 in the year 2008 or later, each DRC is 2/3rds of 1 percent. This level has been determined to be approximately actuarially fair in the sense that, with the time value of money and survivorship properly taken into account, the beneficiary can expect to receive about the same total benefits over his lifetime whether or not the earnings test affects him. This explains the earlier statement that while the liberalization of the earnings test comes at significant short-term expense to the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the longrange cost, which more fully incorporates the DRC effect, is quite modest. This decade is a transitional period during which the amount of DRC for persons attaining age 65 is increasing towards its ultimate level. For persons aged 65-70 with benefits withheld under the earnings test in 1995, the DRC is worth per month either 7/24ths of 1 percent, 8/24ths of 1 percent, or 9/24ths of 1 percent, according to the year of attainment of age 65. Finally, it should be noted that there is no DRC-type provision for recouping auxiliary benefits lost because of either the auxiliarys or primary beneficiarys earnings. In 1995, the earnings test was administered through obligatory beneficiary reports. That is, the beneficiary was required to estimate the amount of his 1995 earnings and subsequently to adjust the estimate to reflect actual experience if they exceeded the yearly threshold. Furthermore, the agency accesses the beneficiarys earnings record to determine additional benefit reduction commensurate with the amount by which the earnings record figure exceeds the self-reported figure. The self-reported amount is accepted, however, when it 5  Social Security Bulletin  Vol. 62  No. 1  1999   is the larger of the two because earnings counted for earnings test purposes need not be identical to earnings counted for FICA taxation purposes. (Very recent changes render this description no longer applicable. Self-reports are no longer required, and the earnings test is administered from the earnings record.)  Benefit Recomputation A retired worker s base benefit amount, the amount payable if entitlement occurs in the month of attainment of age 65, known as the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), is a function of his average annual earnings in the N years of highest earnings, known as the computation years. Under the usual computation methods, N is 35 for persons born in or after 1930 and (35 - k) for persons born k years before 1930. For persons born after 1916, hence aged 78 or younger in 1995, annual earnings up through age 60 are first indexed upwards, making them comparable with more recent earnings, before averaging is done. If a worker beneficiary has earnings in any postentitlement year that are larger than the smallest earnings (after indexing, if appropriate) in his/her computation years, the postentitlement year replaces the lowest-earnings year in the computation period, and the recomputed benefit is payable beginning with January of the following year. Thus, benefit recomputation and earnings test withholding become operative under unlike circumstances. Withholding due to the earnings test is precipitated by attainment of some absolute level of postentitlement earnings, while benefit recomputation is triggered by the attainment of some relative level of postentitlement earnings, that is, in comparison to the lowest (indexed) yearly earnings in the computation period. The recomputation provision is of particular advantage to persons born before 1917 because a current earnings amount is compared to an unindexed amount earned perhaps long ago. Proposals to restrict the recomputation of benefits, or to eliminate it entirely, are frequently put forth. Typically these proposals do not include a concomitant restriction or elimination of FICA taxation on postentitlement earnings, although certainly an argument can easily be made for a more symmetric treatment of such earnings. We estimate that the elimination of recomputations generated by postentitlement earnings in a given year in or after the year of attainment of age 65 would decrease benefits in the following years by about $300 million annually. Unlike the earnings retirement test provision, the recomputation provision has a significant long-range impact, as well.  Bulletin on beneficiaries with benefits withheld under the earnings test are based on data for the entire population of interest, the populations are large enough that 1-in-100 sample estimates are of acceptable precision. (See tables on pages 352 and 353 of the Annual Statistical Supplement to the Social Security Bulletin, 1998, that provide approximate standard errors for such estimates.) Furthermore, the sampling approach makes it feasible to manually review complex or questionable records. Beneficiaries with 1995 benefits withheld due to the earnings retirement test were identified from certain codes (work indication code and reason for deduction) for months during 1995, in the benefit history section of their Master Beneficiary Record (MBR). Those receiving recomputations based on 1995 earnings were identified from a change in PIA effective for January 1996, in the PIA history section of their MBR. The first group was identified in September 1997 and the second in December 1997, both several months after the posting of 1995 earnings and the application to those earnings of the earnings test enforcement and automatic benefit recomputation operations were largely complete. Certain information about persons aged 65-70 with earnings in 1995 above the exempted threshold amount that is not available from program records was obtained from the March 1996 Current Population Survey (CPS) Public Use file. The CPS is a monthly national household survey fielded by the Bureau of the Census with a supplementary inquiry each March into the work experience and income of the population in the preceding year.  Above-Threshold Earners Entitled to Benefits In 1995, about 806,000 persons at calendar ages 65-70 had above-threshold earnings resulting in the withholding of benefits by the retirement earnings test. The group consisted of 743,000 retired-worker beneficiaries whose above-threshold earnings were applied against the entire family benefit, and 63,000 widow(er) and spouse beneficiaries whose abovethreshold earnings were applied only against their own benefit (table 1). The size of the group has not changed much since 1989a finding not unexpected, given the wage-indexing of the exempted threshold amount. The comparable study published most recently in the Bulletin reported that 758,000 retiredworker beneficiaries and 77,000 widow and spouse beneficiaries at calendar ages 65-70 in 1989 had benefits withheld due to the retirement test in that year because of their earnings. The numbers of families with benefits withheld from (1) the primary beneficiary only, (2) the primary and one other beneficiary, or (3) the primary and two or more other beneficiaries, due to above-threshold earnings in 1995 of primaries aged 65-70 were 596,000, 140,000, and 7,000, respectively. Altogether, the benefits of 154,000 spouses and children were withheld because of such earnings, and the total number of beneficiaries with benefits withheld in 1995 due to the above-threshold earnings of beneficiaries at calendar ages 65-70 was 960,000.  Data Sources Our description of the beneficiary populations with benefits withheld because of 1995 earnings due to the earnings test at calendar ages 65-70 or with PIA recomputation at calendar ages 65 or older is primarily based on a 1-in-100 sample of beneficiary and earnings records. Although past studies published in the 6  Social Security Bulletin  Vol. 62  No. 1  1999   The 743,000 retired-worker beneficiaries with abovethreshold earnings represent about 8.5 percent of all retiredworker beneficiaries at calendar ages 65-70 in 1995. The PIA distribution of the worker beneficiaries with above-threshold earnings suggest that they are more likely than other worker beneficiaries to have had high career average earnings. About 70 percent of worker beneficiaries with above-threshold earnings had PIAs greater than the median PIA for all worker beneficiaries in December 1995. Table 1 shows the age and sex composition of the abovethreshold earners. About two-fifths of above-threshold earners in 1995 were women. The age gradient reflects retirement behavior in this range of ages. Additionally, the number at calendar age 70 is particularly low because earnings in or after the month of the 70th birthday are excluded from the earnings test. The total amount of benefits withheld because of the above-threshold earnings in 1995 of beneficiaries aged 65-70 was $4.3 billion, of which $4.1 billion was withheld because of the above-threshold earnings of primary beneficiaries. According to the earlier study published in the Bulletin, the total amount of benefits withheld in 1989 because of the abovethreshold earnings of 758 ,000 primary beneficiaries aged 65-70 was also $4.1 billion. The median amount withheld in 1995 was $3,596 (table 1), which corresponds to earnings of $10,788 above the threshold of $11,280, or earnings of $22,068. Since, as mentioned earlier, P.L. 104-121 provides for a threshold in the year 2002 that corresponds to a threshold of $22,800 in 1995, its effect is to ultimately reduce the number of above-threshold earners by more than half. The median 1995 earnings of all beneficiaries aged 65-70 with above-threshold earnings in 1995 is about $25,800 (table 1). The median is about $31,600 for men, and about $20,900 for women. About 29 percent of beneficiaries aged 65-70 with abovethreshold earnings in 1995 received no benefits that year. The others either had above-threshold earnings less than three times the annual benefits to which they (and their auxiliaries) were entitled, attained age 70 in 1995 (in which cases their benefits were not subject to the test beginning with the month of attainment), or were in a grace year.

The identification of 1995 above-threshold earners who have not applied for primary entitlement benefits for which they are eligible and receive no other program benefits, is not difficult; in fact, there were about 152,000 of these persons at calendar ages 65-70 (including 2,000 persons at calendar age 70 whose benefits at the end of 1995 were not subject to the test!). The difficulty in measuring the effect of the test on the group comes in addressing the questionhow  often is the failure to apply attributable to the earnings test and how often to other considerations? One rationale for not applying, although some benefits are payable, is that a current declination generates increased future benefits through the DRC mechanism, and although the total future increasesuntil the DRC reaches its ultimate levelare less than the foregone benefits, the difference may be small after the income taxation of benefits is considered. We believe that the earnings test is generally the cause of failure to apply for those above-threshold earners whose earnings are so substantial that no benefits would be payable the entire year. According to benefit computations that we performed, almost half of the 152,000 above-threshold earners in 1995 at calendar ages 65-70 who were eligible for primary benefits for which they did not apply, had above-threshold earnings in 1995 greater than three times their potential own benefit for 1995, and thus, had no benefits payable in 1995 unless they would have had auxiliaries, had been eligible for more than one benefit, or if 1995 had been a grace year. 7  Social Security Bulletin  Vol. 62  No. 1  1999   In its estimates of the short-range costs of proposals to eliminate or liberalize the earnings test, the Office of the Chief Actuary assumes that about two-thirds of the eligible abovethreshold earners at calendar ages 65-70 who have not applied for their benefits are reacting to the earnings test. For 1995, this assumption yields an estimate of another 100,000 abovethreshold earners. Had they applied for benefits before 1995, most would have lost the entire year s benefits because of the test. Others would have received benefits for some months, but for some reason chose not to file an application. The median earnings of the 152,000 above-threshold earners who did not claim their primary retirement benefit is $43,750 (table 2). More than two-thirds of the group is male, a reflection of its high-earning character. The analysis was repeated for above-threshold earners in 1991 at calendar ages 65-70 who had not applied for their benefits by the end of 1991, to ascertain their experience through the end of 1997 when the youngest amongst them was age 71. Of the 148,000 in the group, 96,000 began receiving benefits or had died at calendar ages 66-69; 38,000 began receiving benefits or had died at calendar age 70 (the age at which the test ceases to apply); and 9,000 began receiving benefits or had died after calendar age 70. There remain 6,000 yet to apply for their benefits, most of whom earned more than the retirement test threshold in 1996the last year for which earnings are posted.  The percent surviving 5 years among primary beneficiaries aged 65-70 with benefits withheld under the earnings test in 1991 is 92 percent. In contrast, the percent surviving 5 years among all primaries in 1991 at ages 65-70, after direct standardization to the age-sex distribution of the above-threshold earners, is 87 percent. Among primaries who had never been entitled to a disability benefit, the percent surviving the 5 years is 89 percent, after such standardization. Information about the job characteristics of persons employed in 1995 was collected by the Bureau of the Census in the March 1996 Current Population Survey. How do these characteristics differ between persons aged 65-70 (at their last birthday) in March 1996 who earned more than the earnings test threshold value of $11,280 and persons aged 50-59 (at their last birthday) who earned more than that amount? A big difference is in the percent self-employed: 26 percent for the age 65-70 group, versus 14 percent for the age 50-59 group. Also, members of the older group are more likely to be in farming: 5 percent, versus 2 percent. They are more likely to be employed in retail trade and finance industries, and less likely to be employed in manufacturing industries, than members of the younger group. The older workers are more likely to be employed in a professional specialty or sales occupation, and less likely to be employed as a craftsman or machine operator, than the younger workers.  Other Characteristics Keeping the focus on 1991, one may investigate whether there is a health differential between beneficiaries with abovethreshold earnings and other beneficiaries aged 65-70, when health is measured by 5-year survivorship, that is, to the end of 1996. The comparison is limited to primary beneficiaries, and direct standardization is used to control for the differing age-sex composition of the two groups. The comparison is more interesting if persons who were ever disability beneficiaries are excluded from the comparison group, because they would have below-average survivorship. Table 2.--Above-threshold earners aged 65-70 in 1995 eligible for, but not entitled to, OASI benefits, by sex [Numbers in thousands]  Earnings Recomputation Almost 2.0 million primary beneficiaries at calendar ages 65 or older in 1995 with covered earnings in that year realized an increase in their PIA effective January 1996 because of those earnings. About 1.66 million amongst them also realized an increase in the amount of benefit; the others were persons in receipt of two benefits whose total benefit amount did not change because of the recomputation of the primary benefit. The 1.66 million represent about 7 percent of the 24.5 million retired workers aged 65 or older in December 1995. About 1.1 million of the 1.66 million persons were at calendar ages 65-70 in 1995, and about 450,000 were aged 71-78 (table 3). The remaining 110,000 were born in 1916 or earlier, and hence their benefits are determined by average career earnings without indexing. As with the earnings test, retired workers aged 65 or older affected by benefit recomputation have higher PIAs on average than those unaffected. While the average PIA in December 1995 for all retired workers aged 65 or older was $730, for those realizing a benefit increase from recomputation the average PIA was $842. Also similar to the earnings test, there were about two females affected by recomputation for every three males affected. However, the earnings distribution for retired workers receiving recomputation, which does not have a threshold value, is quite different from the earnings distribution for retired workers with benefits withheld under the earnings test. The total increase in benefits, including auxiliary benefits, if any, in January 1996 due to primary beneficiaries aged 65 or older receiving recomputations reflecting 1995 earnings is $25  Item Total number...

The average increase is $12 for recomputations for primaries aged 65-70, $18 for recomputations for primaries aged 71-78, and $29 for recomputations for primaries in the preindexing group. As mentioned earlier, earnings triggering a recomputation need not be large, only larger than the smallest (indexed) amount in the computation years. In fact, in 662,000 recomputations, including most of the recomputations for females, the year 1995 replaced a computation year of zero earnings. For the 65-70 age group, the amount triggering a recomputation was below the earnings test exempt amount in 464,000 of the 1.1 million instances of recomputation. The number of primary beneficiaries at calendar ages 65-70 who were affected by both the earnings test and earnings recomputation because of their 1995 earnings was 594,000 slightly less than the 637,000 affected by earnings recomputation with earnings above the threshold. The difference is explained mostly by the exemption from the test of earnings in or after the month of attainment of age 70, and also by the grace year phenomenon and the treatment of special payments for earnings test purposes. As with the earnings test, a more complete analysis of the effect of earnings at ages 65 or older on benefit levels encompasses their effect on earners who have not yet applied for any program benefits. There are an estimated 167,000 such earners whose PIA would have been larger because of their covered earnings in 1995. Had they been entitled, their average PIA would have increased from $915 in December 1995 to $936 in January 1996 because of their 1995 earnings.

The earnings test has been liberalized by P. L. 104-121, and there are several legislative proposals for further liberalization or elimination of the test. Two recommendations of the 1994-96 Advisory Council on Social Security were: (1) improved incentives for persons to extend their working careers; and (2) revision of the income taxation of Social Security benefits to a way similar to other contributory defined benefit pension plans. The elimination of the earnings test is consistent with the first recommendation, while the elimination of the recomputation of benefits so that the base amount of benefit is determined (except for cost-ofliving adjustment) at initial entitlement is consistent with the rationale for the second recommendation, that is, that Social Security benefits be treated similarly to comparable pension benefits. However, the elimination of benefit recomputation is a disincentive to the extension of working careers, although less so if it were coupled with the elimination of payroll taxation on postentitlement earnings.

GX068-03-12291019	"Union Membership and Density in Construction and              Other Industries               (Section              13 of  The              Construction Chart Book, Third Edition, September 2002 )                                                                                                                                                   The        Center to Protect Workers' Rights                  Nearly 1.4 million construction workers were union members in 2000, accounting        for 19.4% of the 7.2 million wage-and-salary workers in construction. Of        the union members, 1.2 million worked for the private-sector companies,        and the remainder  170,000  were government employees. Also, 69,000 construction        workers who were not union members were represented at their place of work        by unions.                 The statistics are from the Current Population Survey, which includes two        questions about union membership (unionization) and coverage. First, the        survey asks, ""On this (main) job, are you a member of a labor union or of        an employee association similar to a union?"" Respondents who answer ""no""        are asked, ""On this job, are you covered by a union or employee-association        contract?"" The survey asks these questions of wage-and-salary employees        only.                 Union membership rates are calculated using the number of respondents who        answer ""yes"" to the union membership question, divided by the total number        of respondents. ""Union density"" is union membership plus union coverage        of workers not belonging to a union among employed wage-and-salary workers        who respond to those questions.                 The union density rate of wage-and-salary workers (public and private sector)        in construction is higher than in all industries. Also, the union density        rate among construction production (blue-collar) workers is much higher        than density among wage-salary construction workers with all occupations        (chart 13a). 1                  Public-sector construction has roughly double the union density of private-sector        construction  nearly 4 in 10 compared with less than 2 in 10, respectively        (chart 13b).                 Union membership in construction varies as well among construction occupations        (chart 13c) and geographic areas. In 2000, 9 states had a union membership        rate of more than 30%  with Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York,        Missouri, Hawaii, Wisconsin, and Illinois listed in increasing order (chart        13d).                 Unlike this chart book, most publications refer to union density among private-sector        wage-and-salary workers only. And, because the Current Population Survey        interviews people who have permanent addresses and telephones, it may miss        some transient workers, a large proportion of whom work nonunion. As a result,        union density figures provided here may be slightly higher than presented        elsewhere.                                                                                                       1. Production workers        are all workers, except managerial and administrative-support staff  and        include the self-employed.                  Note : Charts 13a and 13b - Production occupations, as distinguished        from managerial and support staff, are coded 500 and above in the Current        Population Survey (see chart book page  12 ). Union        density is union membership plus union coverage of workers not belonging        to a union.                 Note : Chart 13c - These figures do not reflect total membership in        any given union, which may include more than one occupation.

S. Bureau of the Census  Washington, D.C. 20233   December 2001   Working Paper Series No. 61    DISCLAIMER:    This paper reflects the results of research undertaken by the authors. It    has undergone a more limited review than official Census Bureau publications.    This paper is not meant to represent the official view of the U.S. Census Bureau.    This paper has been prepared to inform interested parties of on-going research    and to encourage discussion.          Synopsis    On March 1, 2001, the U.S. Census Bureau issued the recommendation of  the Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) that the  Census 2000 Redistricting Data not be adjusted based on the Accuracy  and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.).  By mid-October 2001, the Census  Bureau had to recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for  future uses, such as the census long form data products, post-censal  population estimates, and demographic survey controls.  In order to  inform that decision, the ESCAP requested that further research be  conducted.   Between March and September 2001, the Demographic Analysis-Population  Estimates (DAPE) research project addressed the discrepancy between the  demographic analysis data and the A.C.E. adjusted estimates of the  population.  Specifically, the research examined the historical levels  of the components of population change to address the possibility that  the 1990 Demographic Analysis understated the national population and  assessed whether demographic analysis had not captured the full  population growth between 1990 and 2000.  Assumptions regarding the  components of international migration (specifically, emigration,  temporary migration, legal migration, and unauthorized migration)  contain the largest uncertainty in the demographic analysis estimates.   Therefore, evaluating the components of international migration was a  critical activity in the DAPE project.    This report focuses on the evaluation of the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated    residual foreign-born population (including both unauthorized and  quasi-legal     migrants) in 1990 and 2000.  The estimates shown here were calculated in    conjunction with estimates of other components of international migration: legal    permanent migration and legal temporary migration. These components of international    migration, along with assumed deaths and emigrants, are subtracted from a total    foreign-born population yielding a residual count.  This residual foreign-born population is not an estimate of the number of    unauthorized migrants. This estimate also includes people who are here legally    but are not yet included in the official estimates of legal migrants and refugees.    It also includes people in ""quasi-legal"" status who are awaiting action    on their legal migration requests. Because the estimate was derived from a residual    methodology, any limitations in the methods or in the measurement of other migration    components are reflected in the residual number. In addition, our assumptions    include a great deal of uncertainty, especially for small migration components.    Therefore, the residual may be quite different from the actual number of unauthorized    migrants.    According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born population    was 3,765,906 in 1990 and 8,705,419 in 2000. The residual foreign born    were less likely to be male (48.4 percent) in 1990 than in 2000 (54.2 percent).    Of the residual foreign born, 26.8 percent were from Mexico in 1990 and 44.5    percent were from Mexico in 2000.           Outline       Summary        Background     Methods           Method 1 : Woodrow's 1990 DA Estimates of the Residual        Foreign-Born Population, 1990       Method 2 : Ahmed's Preliminary Estimates of the Residual        Foreign-Born Counted in the 1990 Census       Method 3 (1990) : DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born        Population, 1990       Method 3 (2000) : DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born        Population, 2000           Limitations     Results     Next Steps        Appendix A.

These ""known""    components of international migration, along with assumed deaths and emigrants,    are subtracted from a total foreign-born population yielding a residual count.       This residual foreign-born population is not an estimate of the number    of unauthorized migrants. This estimate also includes people who are here legally    but are not yet included in the official estimates of legal migrants and refugees.    It also includes people in ""quasi-legal"" status who are awaiting action    on their legal migration requests. Because the estimate was derived from a residual    methodology, any limitations in the methods or in the measurement of other migration    components are reflected in the residual number. In addition, our assumptions    include a great deal of uncertainty, especially for small migration components.    Therefore, the residual may be quite different from the actual number of unauthorized    migrants.    According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born  population counted in the 1990 census was  3,765,906 .   Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate (discussed later in this report)  yields a population of 4,430,478 in 1990.   Selected characteristics of the residual foreign-born population  counted in Census 1990 include:      1.8 million (48.4 percent) were male     1.2 million (32.8 percent) were ages 18 to 29     1.9 million (50.7 percent) were Hispanic     1.0 million (26.8 percent) were from Mexico      According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born  population counted in the 2000 census was  8,705,419 .   Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate yields a population of 10,241,669  in 2000.   Selected characteristics of the residual foreign-born population counted  in Census 2000 include:      4.7 million (54.2 percent) were male     3.5 million (40.0 percent) were ages 18 to 29     5.4 million (61.5 percent) were Hispanic     3.9 million (44.5 percent) were from Mexico      (See Tables in  Appendix A  for more details by age, sex,    race, Hispanic origin, and place (country) of birth for both 1990 and 2000 estimates,    but recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)    The basic methodological approach for both 1990 and 2000 was the residual    method. A decennial census sample file was used for the foreign-born population    base as of April 1 st . Estimates of legal permanent residents (LPRs),    temporary migrants, and Special Agricultural Workers (SAWs) and Pre-1982 entrants    into the U.S. (LAWs) were subtracted from the foreign-born population base. 1     Assumptions were made about emigration and mortality of the legal and IRCA-legalized    populations. Race and Hispanic origin distributions were assigned by age, sex,    and place (country) of birth. 2  Population undercount    assumptions were not included in this methodology. However, estimates of the    total residual foreign-born population are shown here at different assumed levels    of undercoverage.         Background    Since the 1980s, empirically-based estimates have been developed to  measure the population of persons illegally present in the United  States.  Prior to these studies, estimates of the unauthorized population  ranged from one to twelve million. 3    The most straightforward and simplest measure of the unauthorized  population has been the residual method. This method essentially removes  the legal component of the census or survey-based foreign-born population,  leaving behind the unauthorized component as a residual.  Estimates  obtained using residual methods most often are derived from federal  data providers: the U.S. Census Bureau and the Immigration and  Naturalization Service (INS).  Using more than one data source is  required given that no one source of data includes all the necessary  components for directly estimating the unauthorized population.   Adjustments to these estimates have been made since the early 1980s.   Researchers have incorporated new components into their estimates of  unauthorized migration. (Woodrow-Lafield, 1991; Ahmed, 1995; Passel &  Clark, 1998; Bean et al., 2001)  In an effort to improve the validity  of the measures, we have adjusted characteristics of immigrants entering  under the Special Agriculture Workers (SAWs) program,  emigrants leaving  the United States, and nonimmigrants (temporary admissions not for  permanent residence).   Although the INS is the U.S. federal agency responsible for providing the    official estimates of the unauthorized population, the U.S. Census Bureau must    include assumptions about any migrants not counted in the official legal immigration    data.   As part of the Bureau's evaluation of Census 2000 results and the  determination as to whether the Census 2000 counts should be adjusted  for purposes other than reapportionment and redistricting, the Population  Division at the Census Bureau has reviewed the reliability of its  demographic analysis and population estimates methodology, and the  underlying components of population change, including components of  international migration.   This report provides an evaluation of the residual foreign-born component    of international migration as it relates to the U.S. resident population on    April 1, 1990 and April 1, 2000.     This residual foreign-born population    is not an estimate of the number of unauthorized migrants. This estimate also    includes people who are here legally but are not yet included in the official    estimates of legal migrants and refugees. It also includes people in ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Because the    estimate was derived from a residual methodology, any limitations in the methods    or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected in the residual    number. In addition, our assumptions include a great deal of uncertainty, especially    for small migration components. Therefore, the residual may be quite different    from the actual number of unauthorized migrants.             Methods    In addition to detailing our own approach to estimating the residual foreign-born    population (of which the unauthorized population is a part), this report highlights    two other methods used at the Census Bureau during the 1990s to estimate the    residual foreign-born population as of 1990. 4    In order to answer the question placed before us, ""Is the assumed flow of    unauthorized migration realistic?"", the Demographic Analysis-Population Estimates    (DAPE) team reviewed the related research conducted in the late 1980s and in    the 1990s at the Census Bureau as well as other studies addressing this issue.    (See  Appendix B  for details.)    We identified two methods as having been used in the Bureau's estimation of    the residual foreign-born population as of 1990. These methods will be referred    to as: 1) Woodrow's 1990 DA estimates (1991); and 2) Ahmed's 1990 preliminary    census estimates (1995).    Each of the methods relies on residual techniques common to the  estimation of hard-to-count populations such as the unauthorized  population.  For a residual technique, one or more identifiable  components are subtracted from a comprehensive universe (such as the  decennial census' total foreign-born population) yielding a residual  estimate of a population for which no direct measure exists.          Method 1: Woodrow's 1990 DA Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born    Population, 1990 5     Woodrow (1991) developed preliminary estimates of the 1990 residual foreign-born    population as part of the 1990 Demographic Analysis Evaluation Project. 6     This project was undertaken and completed prior to the internal release of 1990    census sample data, therefore, 1990 census data were not used in these calculations.    Woodrow estimates the residual foreign-born population residing in the United    States on April 1, 1990 using two approaches yielding ""direct"" and ""implicit""    estimates, as termed by Woodrow. For the first approach, a residual method was    applied to the 1989 Current Population Survey (CPS) to derive the size of the    residual foreign-born population. This CPS-based estimate was then extended    to reflect the size of the residual foreign-born population on April 1, 1990    by assuming a linear population growth rate. Because of the uncertainties associated    with the sampling and non-sampling errors as well as census under-coverage,    a range of possible estimates was derived. Finally, from the range of possible    values, a (mid)point estimate was determined for six separate census undercount    scenarios. The preferred undercount scenario of 25 percent yielded a midpoint    estimate of 3.3 million unauthorized persons. 7     For her second approach (yielding an ""implicit"" estimate) Woodrow carried    forward the 1980 estimate of the residual foreign-born population and estimated    change in the unauthorized and IRCA-legalized populations between 1980 and 1990    based on alternative post-1980 demographic assumptions from previous CPS-based    estimates. This approach requires estimates of: 1) 1980 residual foreign-born    population estimate; 2) the number of IRCA legalizations (LAWs and SAWs); and    3) the net change during the period.    Based on her analysis Woodrow determined likely ranges under each method,    with a 1990 estimate of 3.3 million (total residual foreign-born population    in the United States) falling in the middle of each range. When considering    census undercoverage (20 to 30 percent, as estimated by Woodrow) and the effect    of CPS sampling and estimation errors, the estimates range from a low of 1.9    million to a high of 4.5 million.    From her 1989 November CPS data carried forward to April 1, 1990, Woodrow    estimated a residual foreign-born population of 2.1 million was counted in the    1990 census (with a range of 1.6 million to 2.7 million).    Some assumptions may widen the lower end of the ranges even further.   For example, the residual method based on the 1989 CPS assumed that no  SAWs were counted among the foreign born because the number of SAWs  then known to be living in the U.S. could not be confirmed (1991, p.  16; p. 29).  Yet, Woodrow cited 1.3 million SAW applications from  June 1, 1987 to November 30, 1988.  The inclusion of a portion of these  SAWs would reduce the level of Woodrow's proposed range.   Woodrow assumed an annual net flow of about 200,000 residual foreign born    during the 1980s. 8  She based this figure on previous    research using November 1979, April 1983, June 1986, June 1988, and November    1989 CPS data. With each new CPS supplement Woodrow supported the range of between    100,000 and 300,000 net annual growth in the residual foreign-born population.    In her 1991 report, Woodrow cautioned the interpretation and use of  her preliminary estimates citing the following issues:      Accuracy of the prior research (e.g., 2.1 million residual foreign-born      persons counted in the 1980 census);     Additional (and unaccounted for) categories of foreign born in the  U.S.;    Assumptions about the foreign-born undercount;    Lack of availability (at the time of her research) of 1990 census data; and     Definition and applicability of ""usual place of residence"" to this population          Method 2: Ahmed's Preliminary Estimates of the Residual Foreign    Born Counted in the 1990 Census     Following the preliminary Woodrow report (1991), 1990 census results were    used to improve residual techniques. In the early 1990s, Bureau work on unauthorized    migration (Fernandez, E.W. and J.G. Robinson, 1994; Robinson, J.G., 1994) and    emigration (Ahmed, B. and J.G. Robinson, 1994) led to the first extensive internal    report regarding the residual equation and how components were derived to estimate    an unauthorized population counted in the 1990 census.    Assuming no coverage or estimation error in the census or in the components,    Ahmed (1995) estimated that 942,000 residual foreign born were counted in the    1990 census. This figure is well below the 3.3 million total residual foreign-born    population put forward in Method 1 by Woodrow (1991), as well as Woodrow's estimated    2.1 million enumerated residual foreign-born population as of 1990.    The Ahmed method uses residual techniques based on the 1990 decennial census,    INS data on legal admissions and IRCA legalizations, and components of change.    The 1990 census data represent the counted foreign-born population as of April    1, 1990, whereas the other components yield the expected legal population at    the census date. These include the number of legal immigrants and refugees (and    deaths to and emigration of these populations), foreign students, and persons    illegally present who legalized under IRCA. 9     This technique assumes that the difference between the census-based total foreign-born    estimate and the legal population will reflect the residual foreign-born population    as counted in the 1990 census.    In his estimates, Ahmed restricts his population to those who entered  between 1980 and 1990.  This has an effect on both the legal and  IRCA-legalized population estimates used in his method.   The legal population (on the INS legal admissions files) consists of  both new arrivals and adjustees.  The new arrivals' year of entry is  assumed to be that of the INS file; in other words, those new arrivals  included in the 1980 INS file are assumed to have entered the U.S. in  1980.  Adjustees were present in the U.S. prior to admission to permanent  legal status, and have years of entry earlier than the year in which  they appear on the INS files.  Ahmed does not take this into account,  but assumes that the new arrivals  and  the adjustees have years  of entry corresponding the INS file year.   The IRCA-legalized population who entered the U.S. prior to 1980 was also    excluded from his method. 10  He states an assumption    that anyone who had come before 1980 would have been legalized under IRCA. However,    the LAW population (pre-1982 entrants) would for the most part have entered    the U.S. prior to 1980 (given the pre-1982 requirements as set in the IRCA legislation),    and would be excluded from the 1980-1990 restricted universe in Ahmed's work.    Had Ahmed included this population, his estimates of the residual foreign-born    population would have been even lower, as this IRCA-legalized component is part    of the legal population subtracted from the total foreign-born population counted    in the census.    For a comparable universe, the legal immigrant population (in the INS Legal    Permanent Resident files) should have been restricted to the legal immigrant    population with years of entry 1980 to 1990. By including the additional persons    (who adjusted from a nonimmigrant status, but who arrived prior to 1980) in    the legal population yields a significantly decreased residual foreign-born    population count.    In his calculations of legal immigration from the INS legal admissions  files, Ahmed appears to have included an additional quarter of admissions  (adding January through March 1980).  The addition of this extra quarter  incorrectly overestimates the legal population.   Unlike the DAPE Method (discussed below), Ahmed does not apply emigration  and death rates to the IRCA-legalized population as he does with the  legal population.  Fortunately, Ahmed does age the IRCA-legalized  population an average of two years (from an averaged application year  of 1988) to April 1990.   Ahmed restricted the temporary migrant population to the foreign student population    for his work. Had this population been more broadly defined (to include other    temporary residents such as H-1B workers) the overall residual foreign-born    population estimate would have been lower.    The Ahmed estimates were never incorporated into any  official estimates produced by the Census Bureau.          Method 3 (1990): DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born Population,    1990     The 1990 residual foreign-born estimate was calculated in conjunction with    estimates of other components of international migration: legal permanent migration    and legal temporary migration. These ""known"" components of international migration,    along with assumed deaths and emigrants, are subtracted from a total foreign-born    population yielding a residual count.     This residual foreign-born population    is not an estimate of the number of unauthorized migrants. This estimate also    includes people who are here legally but are not yet included in the official    estimates of legal migrants and refugees. It also includes people in ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Because the    estimate was derived from a residual methodology, any limitations in the methods    or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected in the residual    number. In addition, our assumptions include a great deal of uncertainty, especially    for small migration components. Therefore, the residual may be quite different    from the actual number of unauthorized migrants.   Numbers presented here are based on the entire residual foreign-born population    (including some legal populations such as refugees and asylum applicants). Characteristics    attributable to the residual foreign born may not be the same as for the unauthorized    migrant population.    The DAPE Team estimates 3,765,906 residual foreign born were counted in the    1990 census. Adjusting for an assumed 15-percent net undercount rate, we estimate    that as of April 1, 1990 the total residual foreign-born population would be    4,430,478. Adjusting for an assumed 20-percent net undercount rate, the estimated    1990 residual foreign-born population would be 4,707,383.    (Table A-1 of  Appendix A  shows the total residual foreign-born    population as of April 1, 1990 by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, but recall    that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)   The foreign-born population can be depicted as:    FB = L + U    where  FB  is the total foreign born, and  L  and  U   are the legal and unauthorized migrant components, respectively.   The residual foreign-born population in 1990 (R 1990 ) was  estimated using the following formula:              R 1990  =         [R 1980  - (E 1980-1990  + D 1980-1990 )]        + FB 1980-1990  - [(LPR 1980-1990  + IRCA 1980-1990 )        - (E 1980-1990  + D 1980-1990 )] - T 1987-1990          where a 1980-based estimate of the residual foreign born (R 1980 )    is carried forward to April 1, 1990 through emigration and death.  FB     is the 1990 Census total foreign born who entered the U.S. between 1980 and    1990.  LPR  is the legal permanent residents (legal admissions) component    for the 1980-1990 period and  IRCA  refers to the IRCA-legalized population.    These two ""legal"" populations are carried forward to April 1, 1990 through  E     (emigration) and  D  (death). 11      T  refers to temporary migrants (nonimmigrants) who are not  affected by emigration or death because they are assumed to be  continuously replaced by new temporary migrants of similar  characteristics. The years of entry were limited to the past three  years (1987-1990) to reflect the short-term residence of most temporary  migrants. 12    Similar to Method 2 discussed earlier, the DAPE Method uses residual techniques    based on the 1990 decennial census, INS data on legal admissions, and components    of change. The 1990 census data represent the  counted  foreign-born    population as of April 1, 1990, whereas the latter two components yield the     expected  legal population at the census date. These include the number    of legal migrants (including most refugees who adjusted to LPR status), temporary    migrants, and people illegally present who legalized under IRCA, 13     deaths to and emigration of legal migrants and the IRCA-legalized population.    This technique relies on the simple assumption that the difference between the    census-based total foreign-born estimate and the legal population will reflect    the size of the residual foreign-born population on the census date.    Adjustments were necessary to address errors in the two primary sets  of data, the census data and the INS figures.  Any response misreporting,  such as citizenship status, through a misinterpretation of the question  being asked or through an intentional misrepresentation, is not  addressed by this method.   About 900,000 refugees were estimated to have entered the U.S. during  the 1980s.  Approximately 800,000 adjusted status during this period.   The remaining 100,000 are assumed to be included in the residual amount  shown here. 14     Unauthorized Population Universe    One of the major problems in measuring unauthorized migration is defining    the population. Of the unauthorized migrants physically present in the U.S.    at any given time, some proportion would not be considered ""usual residents""    of the United States according to the definitions of enumeration used in the    U.S. census. It is assumed that the DAPE Method does not include ""sojourner""    or ""commuter"" migrants-people who enter the U.S. for temporary (even daily)    lengths of stay. (See Passel (1988) for more information.)     1990 Census Modified Sample File    A 1990 sample file was created for use by all DAPE teams working on  international migration components.  This file contains race, Hispanic  origin, sex, age, place of birth, citizenship status, and other  information.  Race and Hispanic origin were assigned, based on the  1990 sample file distribution of the foreign born who entered the U.S.  between 1980 and 1990, to components that did not have these  characteristics.   This allocation method proportionally assigned race and Hispanic  origin by place of birth, year of entry, age, and sex of the  foreign born. 15    People for whom no place of birth was reported (808,158 weighted cases)  were assigned a place of birth based on the proportional distribution  by state of the foreign-born population with reported place of birth  in the 1990 sample file.   The total foreign-born population estimate from the 1990 census file,  used in these calculations, is 19,767,316. 16   For the purpose  of this analysis, the foreign-born population was restricted to those  whose year of entry into the U.S. was between 1980 and 1990 (8,663,627).   For the year of entry question on the 1990 census, a multiple-choice  format that offered ten pre-determined entry periods of various  durations was used.  However, the Census 2000 questionnaire provided  a write-in field limited to four spaces to represent the actual year  of arrival.    Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) - INS Administrative Records,  1980-1990 17    The LPR files used for this analysis were created from the INS microdata  where some allocations for age and sex have been made.  The fiscal  year-based INS files (October 1 st  to September 30 th )  have been converted to ""census years,"" April 1 st  to March  31 st .   For new arrival cases, year of admission (into legal permanent resident  status) was assumed to equal year of entry into the U.S.  For adjustees,  year of nonimmigrant admission has been used in place of year of  admission for year of entry into the U.S. as these people resided in  the U.S. prior to obtaining LPR status.  Of these cases, anyone with a  year of entry prior to 1980 has been excluded from our analysis (542,245  cases).   Although some researchers have questioned the completeness of the records    in the INS LPR files (Warren and Passel, 1987), we have not assessed the quality    of the INS data for this project. Instead, we recognize that any incompleteness    could lead to some legal residents being included in the residual foreign-born    estimate.    IRCA-Legalized Population (LAWs (INA Section 245A) & SAWs (INA Section    210))     IRCA-legalized data for our 1990 estimates come from the 1992 Legalization    Summary Public Use Tape (LSPUT) file of IRCA LAWs and SAWs, processed through    August 12, 1992. 18  The file consists of 3,040,948    applications (1,763,434 LAWs and 1,277,514 SAWs). Of these, 1,031,404 LAWs (58.5    percent) and 1,256,015 SAWs (98.3 percent) entered the U.S. between 1980 and    1990. Our 1990 estimate included only those people who were granted LPR status    through August 12, 1992 (942,078 LAWs and 1,057,293 SAWs). Our 2000 estimate    (described below) included those cases processed throughout the remainder of    the 1990s.    For the DAPE Method we assume that all the SAWs were resident in the  United States as of Census Day, April 1, 1990.  Of the 1.3 million SAW  applications for legalization, 9,177 (0.7 percent) had a state of  residence outside the 50 States and Washington, DC. (Smith, et al.,  1996)  Other researchers have taken different approaches to address  the issue of whether SAWs were present or not at the time of the census,  assuming that some portion of the SAW population (certainly greater  than 0.7 percent) was not present in the U.S. at the time of the 1990  census. (Woodrow, 1991; Clark et al., 1994; Bean, 2001)   Pending cases (22,906 LAWs and 18,144 SAWs), who entered the U.S. between    1980 and 1990 are not counted in the IRCA-legalized population for our 1990    estimate, and, therefore, are included in the unauthorized population count    for 1990. Denied cases are assumed to be counted in this residual-based foreign-born    estimate as well.    Because the age of IRCA applicants was recorded as their age at the  date of application, we aged this population two years to the census  date, April 1, 1990.  The period of application for LAWs was May 5,  1987 to May 4, 1988, and June 1, 1987 to November 30, 1988 for SAWs.   The LSPUT file contains incomplete data on race and Hispanic origin  detail for the IRCA-legalized population.  Therefore, we have assigned  these characteristics, based on the foreign born whose entrance to the  U.S. was 1980 to 1990 from the 1990 Census Modified Sample File, by  age, sex, country of birth, year of entry, and citizenship status  (non-citizens only).    Death to and Emigration of Legal and IRCA-Legalized Populations     Calculations of mortality and emigration rates were based on information provided    by the Emigration DAPE Team. 19  This team developed    the assumptions used for estimating emigration and mortality of the foreign    born.   For estimating emigration, rates were assigned by age, sex, race, Hispanic    origin, and country of birth. For estimating mortality, for each year of entry    (beginning in 1980), survival rates were calculated by age group according to    amount of time between year (time) of entry and the census year (for instance,    age 0 in mid-year 1980 would have 9.75 years exposure through April 1990). 20      Temporary Migrants (Nonimmigrants) 21     For the 1990 estimates of international migration, data on temporary  migrants come from the 1990 Census Modified Sample file.  People were  considered to be temporary migrants depending on their education  (attainment and school enrollment), industry, occupation, employment  status, income, age, year of entry, and household relationship.   Not all countries are included (for example, Cuba and USSR), because  people from those countries were assumed to most likely be refugees,  and therefore were not counted as temporary migrants.   According to the Temporary Migrant DAPE research, 487,453 temporary  migrants were counted in the 1990 census.    1980 Residual Foreign-Born Population Carried Forward to 1990     For our 1980 residual foreign-born population base, we relied on figures  that Passel (1988) provided for his 1980 census-enumerated unauthorized  population estimates.  Passel estimated that about 2.1 million  unauthorized migrants were included in the 1980 census (1.1 million  men and 1.0 million women).   We allocated age, country of birth, race, and Hispanic origin to this population    from the 1990 sample file distribution of the foreign born who entered the U.S.    prior to 1980. This estimate was carried forward to April 1990 through emigration    and death yielding a residual foreign-born population estimate of 1,770,505.    Some unauthorized migrants, included in the 1980 estimate, would eventually    acquire legal status through IRCA in the 1980s. These migrants have not been    removed from the 1980 estimate carried forward to 1990, and thus the result    is a residual foreign-born rather than an unauthorized population as of 1990. 22  (See the  Limitations  section    of this report.)     Undercount Rates    Previous research on estimating unauthorized migration have included  varying assumptions about the undercount of the foreign-born population  and the rates of undercoverage by legal status. (Passel, 1988; Woodrow,  1991; Bean, 2001)  Rates of undercount in the census for the unauthorized  population have been assumed to be higher than for the legal population,  and have generally fallen between 15 and 20 percent, with undercount  rates for men being higher than for women. (Bean, 2001)    Appendix A  includes four tables (A-1a, A-1b, A-2a, A-2b)    showing our estimated 1990 residual foreign-born population by age, sex, race,    and Hispanic origin with assumed rates of undercount at 15 and 20 percent. These    rates were simply applied to the residual foreign-born population estimates    shown in  Table A-1 , and were not integrated into the development    of the estimates themselves.           Method 3 (2000): DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born Population,    2000     The 2000-based estimates of the residual foreign born were calculated  using the 1990 methodology (for the 1980 to 1990 period)  plus   the resulting 1990 estimate carried forward to April 1, 2000.  As with  the 1990 estimates, unauthorized migrants  and  quasi-legal  migrants (e.g., refugees/asylees not adjusted to LPR status) are  included in the residual-based estimate.   Our initial attempt at estimating the quasi-legal migrant population  suggests that about 1.7 million (19.5 percent) were included in the  residual foreign born estimate for 2000.  This estimate includes  (estimated number):     refugees (who have not yet adjusted status) and asylum applicants (awaiting      claim adjudication) (200,000 and 400,000, respectively)     migrants deported during the decade (200,000)     population legalizing (adjusting status) during the decade (900,000)     Numbers presented here are based on the entire residual foreign-born population    (including some legal populations such as refugees and asylum applicants). Characteristics    attributable to the residual foreign born may not be the same as for the unauthorized    migrant population.    The DAPE Team estimates 8,705,419 residual foreign born were counted in the    2000 census. Adjusting for undercount, we estimate that as of April 1, 2000    the total residual foreign-born population was 10,241,669 (15 percent undercount).    This estimate was used for the revised DA estimate for 2000.    (Table A-3 of  Appendix A  shows the total residual foreign-born    population as of April 1, 2000 by age, sex, and race and Hispanic origin, but    recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)     1990 Methodology Applied to 2000    Our 2000 method uses residual techniques based on preliminary 2000 census    data, INS data on legal admissions 1990 to 2000, 23     and components of change. The 2000 census data represent the  counted     foreign-born population as of April 1, 2000, whereas the latter two components    yield the  expected  legal population at the census date. These include    the number of legal migrants (including most refugees who adjusted to LPR status),    temporary migrants, and persons illegally present who legalized under IRCA who    were processed  after  August 12, 1992, 24     deaths to and emigration of legal migrants and the IRCA-legalized population.    This technique relies on the simple assumption that the difference between the    census-based total foreign-born estimate and the legal population will reflect    the size of the residual foreign-born population on the census date.     2000 Census Preliminary Sample File    The total foreign-born population estimate from the Census 2000 Preliminary    Sample File, used in these calculations, was 31,098,946. 25     For the 2000 estimates, the foreign-born population was restricted to those    whose year of entry into the U.S. was between April 1990 and March 2000 (12,518,098).    The Census 2000 file used for these estimates (and those of other international    migration components in the DAPE project) may differ from final census files    processed later in 2001/2002. 26      1990 Residual Foreign-Born Population Carried Forward to 2000    The 1990 estimate of  3,765,906  should be reduced due to death    (162,830), emigration (391,275), and adjustment of status of the 1990 unauthorized    migrants included in the 1990 residual foreign-born population who adjusted    throughout the 1990s (about 900,000). However, the population legalizing during    the decade was not removed from this 1990 residual foreign-born population carried    forward to 2000. 27          Limitations    Although the residual technique used to derive estimates of residual foreign    born is based on the simple idea of subtracting the expected legal population    from the counted foreign-born population at the census date, the approach suffers    from a number of limitations. These limitations stem from anomalies and shortcomings    in the data sets used, assumptions made to correct for data deficiencies or    to derive estimates, and the exclusion of components that may prove to be relevant    in the changing migration environment.     Inclusion of Quasi-Legal Migrants in the Residual Foreign-Born Estimate    The most important limitation to the methodology and the resulting estimates    described in this report pertains to the inclusion of quasi-legal migrants (e.g.,    refugees not adjusted for LPR status) in the residual foreign-born estimate.    This limitation appears to have a greater impact on the 2000 estimate than on    the 1990 estimate. This is actually not a limitation for the use of this estimate    in calculating coverage as legal status is not relevant.     Data Quality and Other Data Source Limitations    The precision of our results will depend upon the quality and  completeness of the data used, namely the decennial census files, and  the administrative records of legal and IRCA-legalized populations  provided by the INS.   Other data source limitations include:     For the 2000 estimate, final Census 2000 sample data were not      available at the time of this project    Individual years-of-entry from 1990 census were unattainable      given questionnaire response options    Accuracy of 1980 residual foreign-born estimate was unknown     Emigration and mortality rates were assumed to be the same      regardless of legal status    Methodological Limitations       Limitations of other international migration components are carried over      into our estimates;     Flow (INS) data were modified to be combined with stock (Census) data;     For calculations, assumed 100 percent census coverage of foreign born regardless      of legal status;     For the 1990 estimate, assume 100 percent of SAWs were present in U.S. on      April 1, 1990;     Some ""humanitarian"" populations (i.e., non-adjusted refugees and asylum      applicants) were omitted from legal population, and, therefore, included in      residual foreign-born count;     IRCA-legalized 1990 estimate was restricted to people granted permanent      legal status (Phase II decisions); pending cases were included in the residual      foreign born in 1990 estimate;     Applicability of ""usual residence"" unclear for migrants;    Assumed no difference in race or Hispanic origin identification between      administrative records and census;    Approximated characteristics of the 1980 unauthorized migrant      population based on the foreign born who reported pre-1980 entries      in the 1990 Census.    Time Constraints    The DAPE project began in late April 2001, and was originally scheduled for    completion by July 31, 2001. Extensions were granted through September 10 th     for the DAPE task of estimating the residual foreign-born population as of 1990    and 2000.    However, lack of detailed, historical documentation on both source  files and assumptions and methods led to delays in meeting the  milestones of the overall project timeline.  In addition, several  technical obstacles resulted due to limited documentation.   Comparisons of our 1990 estimates with the official (original) 1990 DA  work by Woodrow (1991) could not be made given different data sources  and limited time to replicate her CPS-based work while preparing our  census and administrative records-based estimates.   Therefore, future work should include a validation of the 1990 DA work  by Woodrow, along with additional research into alternative methods  and data by other researchers working on this issue.  (Espenshade,  1995a; Passel, 1998; Warren, 2000; Bean, 2001)    Impact of Legislation on Migratory Patterns and Quality of Data  Collection    Legislation such as IRCA and more recent legislation in the 1990s  including the changes to the Immigration & Nationality Act (INA)  in 1990 and migration-related legislative changes in 1996 (e.g., Illegal  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) (Pub. L.  104-208); Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) (Pub.  L. 104-132) impact both migratory patterns and the quality of data  collection.  Movement across borders (and into legal statuses) are  facilitated and impeded by legislation.  Data collection instruments  and the type of data collected also change with new legislation.  These  changes, such as with the IRCA legalizations (and related data), affect  our estimates as well.    Undercount Rates    Undercount rates are used in this report only for illustrative purposes.   Nowhere within this report has there been a comprehensive evaluation  of undercount rates for the foreign-born population by legal status or  otherwise.  Our 1990 and 2000 estimates are shown in   Appendix A  tables for both census (enumerated) and DA (""true"" or resident) levels.  In line with contemporary research on undercoverage of the foreign born, undercount rates of 15 and 20 percent (DA level estimates) are presented along with the census-level estimates of the residual foreign-born population as of 1990 and 2000.   From all appearances, the 2000 census is more complete and accurate  than 1990.  The advertising campaign, partnership programs, and use of  the Master Address File (MAF) may have contributed to the improved  coverage of the 2000 census.   Assessing the coverage of the foreign-born and both the legal and residual    foreign-born populations is important to developing improved estimates of each    population. As part of the Post Enumeration Survey (PES) for the 1990 census,    undercount rates were not calculated for the foreign born in particular. Race    and Hispanic origin-specific rates were derived that can be used to approximate    such rates for the foreign born. Harder still is the development of undercount    rates by legal status. Again, researchers outside the Census Bureau have analyzed    this issue and have provided their own rates by legal status. (Binational Study,    1997; Bean, 2001).    Anecdotal evidence suggests that census coverage improved between the 1990    and 2000 decennial censuses. Hence, undercount rates for the unauthorized migrant    population are assumed to have improved between 1990 and 2000. 28      IRCA-Legalized Population     Our 1990 residual foreign-born population estimate includes the IRCA-legalized    population through August 12, 1992. People granted legal status  after     April 1, 1990 (but before August 13, 1992) would be included in our 1990 residual-based    estimate as legal, thereby reducing the ""true"" unauthorized population present    on Census Day, April 1, 1990.         Results    We put forward estimates of the residual foreign-born population residing    in the United States as of April 1, 1990 and April 1, 2000, as shown below in    Table 1.    Table 1.

This estimate also includes ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Any limitations    in the methods or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected    in the residual number.  1990 Estimates     According to our calculations shown above in Table 1, the estimated  residual foreign-born population counted in the 1990 census was   3,765,906 .  Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate  yields a residual foreign-born population of 4,430,478 in 1990.   Of the 3.8 million, 1.8 million (48.4 percent) were male (Table A-1);  1.2 million (32.8 percent) were ages 18 to 29 (Table A-1); 3.5 million  (92.2 percent) were Nonblack (Table A-1); 1.9 million (50.7 percent)  were Hispanic (Table A-2); and 1.0 million (26.8 percent) were from  Mexico (Table A-7).    2000 Estimates    According to our calculations shown above in Table 1, the estimated residual    foreign-born population counted in the 2000 census was  8,705,419 .    Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate yields a residual foreign-born population    of 10,241,669 in 2000.    Of the 8.7 million, 4.7 million (54.2 percent) were male (Table A-3);  3.5 million  (40.0 percent) were ages 18 to 29 (Table A-3); 8.1 million  (93.0 percent) were Nonblack (Table A-3); 5.4 million (61.5 percent)  were Hispanic (Table A-4); and 3.9 million (44.5 percent) were from  Mexico (Table A-8).   (See  Appendix A  for extensive detail by age, sex, race,    Hispanic origin, and place (country) of birth for both 1990 and 2000 estimates,    but recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)    Our new 1990 estimate, also with an assumed undercount rate of 25 percent,    is 5.0 million, well above the Woodrow 1990 DA figure of 3.3 million. 29     To clarify, Woodrow's DA estimate was computed based on November 1989 CPS data,    prior to the availability of the 1990 census sample files.    Our estimates are based on a modified 1990 census sample file, and  include legal migrants not explicitly accounted for in other legal  migrant components of this project.    Comparing the DAPE 1990 and 2000 Estimates with Other Findings (Woodrow,    1991; Ahmed, 1995; Warren, unpublished; Bean, 2001; Passel, 2001)     Although not included here, a comprehensive analysis of our estimates would    comprise an evaluation beyond total population counts to include reviews by    specific countries of birth, age, sex, race/Hispanic origin, year of entry,    and other components of migration (used to derive these estimates). 30     Even though the sources used similar techniques, estimates of the size of    the residual foreign-born population varied widely. Ahmed (Method 2) placed    the figure at 942,000 while Woodrow (Method 1) found the number to be 2.1 million     counted  in the 1990 census. 31     Discrepancies among estimates, in comparing our 1990 estimates with  both Ahmed (1995) and Woodrow (1991), can be summarized as follows:      Adjustments for Undercount : Not all methods included an adjustment      for undercount of the foreign born or by legal status. Neither the DAPE Method      nor Ahmed's make assumptions about undercount in the calculations of the residual      foreign-born population. Woodrow (1991) assumes undercoverage in the census      and makes allowances for sampling and estimation error in the CPS.            Death and Emigration : Estimates of deaths to and emigration of legal      immigrants were calculated for both Method 1 and Method 2, but figures were      not always incorporated in the calculations of the residual foreign-born population.            IRCA LAWs and SAWs : The figures for LAWs and SAWs differed greatly      from one source to another. These differences may account for significant      discrepancies in the estimates of the residual foreign-born population across      methods.            Country-Specific (Negative) Estimates : While the range of derived      figures for the residual foreign-born population may be plausible, evaluating      the total number reveals some inconsistencies. For a number of countries the      estimates are negative, and this is true across methods. On the other hand,      the derived estimates for other countries seem over-estimated. For example,      the Ahmed report places the size of residual foreign-born population from      Mexico at about 160,000 or 17 percent, which appears to be low. We estimated      that 27 percent of the residual foreign born in 1990 was from Mexico; our      2000 estimate was closer to 45 percent from Mexico. Most studies indicate      that Mexico constitutes a substantial proportion of the unauthorized population,      around 55 percent. (Warren, 2000; Bean, 2001)      In comparison with our 2000 estimate, Warren (unpublished) suggests  6.7 million unauthorized migrants were counted in the 2000 census, and  that when undercount of the foreign born was taken into consideration  (by legal status) the unauthorized resident population count rose to  7.6 million.   Bean (2001) estimates about 2.5 million Mexicans were residing in the U.S.    in March 1996 yielding an estimated 3.9 million unauthorized migrants from Mexico    (when carried forward to March 2000). Through our calculations of the counted    residual foreign born in 2000, we estimated 3.9 million Mexicans (44.5 percent    of the residual foreign born in 2000). 32  Bean    also estimates a total unauthorized population of about 7.1 million in 2000.    According to the 1990 residual results, the 18-49 age group accounts for 58    percent of the total population; for the 2000 estimate the proportion of the    same age group is 70 percent.    Analysis of the sex structure, on the other hand, shows the number of residual    foreign-born women greater than the number of residual foreign-born men in 1990;    for the 2000 results, more residual foreign-born men were living in the country.    The greater number of women in 1990 was unexpected as migrants were disproportionately    male, but it may be attributed to the effect of the IRCA legalization program.    Because more men benefited from the amnesty than women and were subsequently    allowed to bring their families to the U.S., it is conceivable that the number    of residual foreign-born women was higher than the number of residual foreign-born    men in 1990. This explanation is consistent with the higher number of Hispanic    women aged 18 to 49.         Next Steps - Improvements in Current Approach and Alternative  Methods of Measurement    Research will be conducted in the near future on the extent to which  the 1990 and 2000 estimates can be revised to more accurately reflect  the unauthorized migrant component of the residual foreign-born  population.  Some minor changes are readily apparent and relatively  simple to incorporate into the current methodology.   Our selection of a single method by which to estimate the unauthorized population    for the DAPE task should not be misinterpreted as a clear preference for one    methodology.    The DAPE project was endeavored to be an ""integrated"" process. In other words,    all of the task teams that were responsible for estimating a single component    of international migration (e.g., legal, unauthorized, and temporary migrants,    and emigrants) were required to integrate their work (methods, assumptions,    and data sources) wherever possible.    Estimates of unauthorized migration (flow) and unauthorized migrants  (stock) that use alternative data sources (e.g., apprehensions data  (Espenshade, (1995a); 3-Card Method (GAO, 1998)) should be explored to  test the validity and reliability of the estimates produced here.   Alternative assumptions and methods developed outside the Bureau should  be examined more closely as well.  Warren (2000 and unpublished), Bean  (2001), and Passel (1998 and 2001) have provided extensive detail on  the estimation of the unauthorized population.   Their research provides invaluable information that should be referenced regularly    as the Census Bureau revisits its estimates of the residual foreign-born and    unauthorized migrant populations.        NOTES:   1  Both the Special Agricultural Workers (SAWs) and pre-1982 entrants  (LAWs) were legalized under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA).   2  Assignment of race and Hispanic Origin based on  state-specific foreign-born populations would have been a refinement  of this allocation technique, given the geographic concentration of  the foreign-born population in the U.S.  However, this approach was  not used due to time constraints of this project.   3   ""Residual methods generally were not employed with data  collected before the 1980s because the 1980 census was the first  decennial census in which a sizable  enumerated  unauthorized  migrant population could be detected through demographic analysis.""  (Fay, Passel, and Robinson, 1988 cited in Bean, 2001, p. 412)   4  Earlier Census Bureau documentation used such terms as ""undocumented,""  ""illegal,"" or ""unauthorized migrants."" The methods and the  results supporting these documents were actually reflecting the residual foreign-born  population.    5  See Woodrow-Lafield, K.A. 1991. ""Demographic analysis evaluation  project D2: Preliminary estimates of undocumented residents in 1990."" (1990 Decennial  Census, Preliminary Research & Evaluation Memorandum no. 75) (22 October 1991).     6  This analysis provided the unauthorized population number used for  the 1990 DA. The 1990 DA number was used later in the construction of the 2000  DA estimates released in March 2001.   7  Woodrow (1991) suggested that plausible levels of undercoverage in  the census were between 20 and 30 percent.   8  A net annual flow of 200,000 unauthorized migrants was used in the  Bureau's postcensal population estimates during this period.   9  From the INS IRCA-legalized files, Ahmed selected cases with status  granted or pending and having complete information on age, sex, and country of  birth, year of entry, and intended state of and county of residence: 1,658,986  LAWs and 1,084,233 SAWs. (Ahmed 1995, pgs. 5-6)   10   When describing the LAW and SAW populations Ahmed takes  into account IRCA-legalized people regardless of when they entered the  U.S.  However, in his calculations (shown in the formulas on pages 1  and 8 of his report) he does not appear to include the pre-1980  entrants, a large segment of the LAW population.   11   No legal migrants are assumed to have become  unauthorized during the decade.   12  For more information on the treatment of temporary migrants, see  Working Paper #60.   13   Unlike Ahmed's (1995) method (Method 2 here), this  method does not include cases pending authorization in the  IRCA-legalized population.   14  In evaluating this work in the near future, this  ""humanitarian"" component will be treated separately helping to make  possible a more precise estimate of the unauthorized population.   15  For the DAPE work, countries of birth of the foreign born were grouped  into 40 countries and regions. (See  Appendix A  for tables  with details by place (country) of birth.)   16   Of the total foreign-born population (all years of  entry), 488,570 were in group quarters in 1990.   17  Refer to Working Paper #59 for detailed information on the legal  files used in this analysis.   18  The INS discontinued the data system used to process the IRCA-related  applications through August 12, 1992. By this time, the INS had processed 3.0  million applications or 88 percent of the LAW and 84 percent of the SAW cases.  (Smith, et al., 1996)   19  See Working Paper #62 for detailed information on the emigration  and mortality data and assumptions used in this analysis.   20  Persons 100 years of age and above are assumed to have the same  mortality rates (by sex).   21  Refer to Working Paper #60 for detailed information on temporary  migrants (nonimmigrants).   22  This limitation will also affect the 2000 estimate. (This will be  discussed in greater detail later in this report.)   23  INS data on legal immigrants and refugees are available through  fiscal year 1999 (September 1999). A population as of April 1, 2000 is needed  for our analysis. An October 1999-March 2000 population was estimated using the  distributions of the FY 1999 file.   24  The 2000 method picks up where the 1990 method left off with regard  to the IRCA-legalized population. As of August 12, 1992, 22,906 LAWs and 18,144  SAWs were pending authorization. With the use of published INS data (INS, 2000),  cases identified as pending in the IRCA files were ""matched"" to actual cases approved  post-August 1992. As limited detail was included in the published data, characteristics  were assigned to these cases based on IRCA LSPUT information used in the 1990-based  estimates. It is assumed that the only reason why these cases were pending was  administrative in nature, and, therefore, had no bearing on the applicants' characteristics. 25      25  Of the total foreign-born population (all years of entry), 543,435  were estimated to be in group quarters in 2000.   26  Final edit specifications and weighting schemes had not yet been  fully developed for use in these preliminary sample files.   27  Beginning in October 1994, section 245(i) of the Immigration &  Nationality Act (INA) allowed unauthorized residents who were eligible for legal  immigrant status to remain in the U.S. and adjust to permanent resident status  by applying at an INS office and paying a fee. Prior to October 1994, most unauthorized  residents were required to leave the U.S. and acquire a visa abroad from the Department  of State as they are again now. (INS, pA.3-2, 2000)   28  The revised DA estimates used a 15-percent net undercount rate assumption  for the residual foreign born in 2000, and a 20-percent net undercount rate assumption  for the residual foreign born in 1990.   29  Woodrow's (1991) DA-level estimate of 3.3 million was calculated  based on an assumed 25 percent undercount of unauthorized migrants in the 1990  census.   30  Such a review is forthcoming.   31  As mentioned previously, Woodrow did not make use of 1990 census  data for her estimates. She estimated the residual foreign-born population as  of November 1989 and carried them forward (through emigration and death) to April  1, 1990.   32  Bean assumes that 55 percent of the unauthorized population would  be Mexican in 2000.

   union affiliation but whose jobs are covered by a union or an employee association contract.        NOTE:  Data for 2001 have been revised to reflect the introduction of Census 2000-based population controls.  In addition,      the data on ""represented by unions"" incorporate a minor change to the allocation procedure for that item.  The change in      procedure had a neligible affect on the estimates.  Data refer to the sole or principal job of full-time workers.  Excluded      are all self-employed workers regardless of whether or not their businesses are incorporated.  Detail for the above race and      Hispanic-origin groups will not sum to totals because data for the ""other races"" group are not presented and Hispanics are      included in both the white and black population groups.

all persons. The age classification is based on the age of the person in complete years as of April 1, 1990. The age response in question 5a was used normally to represent a person's age. However, when the age response was unacceptable or unavailable, a person's age was derived from an acceptable year-of-birth response in question 5b.   Data on age are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a person and to classify other characteristics in census tabulations. Age data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and examine many programs and policies. Therefore, age is tabulated by single years of age and by many different groupings, such as 5-year age groups.   Some tabulations are shown by the age of the householder. These data were derived from the age responses for each householder. (For more information on householder, see the discussion under ""Household Type and Relationship."")   Median Age--This measure divides the age distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value and one-half above the value. Generally, median age is computed on the basis of more detailed age intervals than are shown in some census publications; thus, a median based on a less detailed distribution may differ slightly from a corresponding median for the same population based on a more detailed distribution. (For more information on medians, see the discussion under ""Derived Measures."")   Limitation of the Data--Counts in 1970 and 1980 for persons 100 years old and over were substantially overstated. Improvements were made in the questionnaire design, in the allocation procedures, and to the respondent instruction guide to attempt to minimize this problem for the 1990 census.  Review of detailed 1990 census information indicated that respondents tended to provide their age as of the date of completion of the questionnaire, not their age as of April 1, 1990. In addition, there may have been a tendency for respondents to round their age up if they were close to having a birthday. It is likely that approximately 10 percent of persons in most age groups are actually 1 year younger. For most single years of age, the misstatements are largely offsetting. The problem is most pronounced at age 0 because persons lost to age 1 may not have been fully offset by the inclusion of babies born after April 1, 1990, and because there may have been more rounding  up to age 1 to avoid reporting age as 0 years. (Age in complete months was not collected for infants under age 1.)  The reporting of age 1 year older than age on April 1, 1990, is likely to have been greater in areas where the census data were collected later in 1990. The magnitude of this problem was much less in the three previous censuses where age was typically derived from respondent data on year of birth and quarter of birth. (For more information on the design of the age question, see the section below that discusses ""Comparability."")   Comparability--Age data have been collected in every census. For the first time since 1950, the 1990 data are not available by quarter year of age. This change was made so that coded information could be obtained for both age and year of birth. In each census since 1940, the age of a person was assigned when it was not reported. In censuses before 1940, with the exception of 1880, persons of unknown age were shown as a separate category. Since 1960, assignment of unknown age has been performed by a general procedure described as ""imputation."" The specific procedures for imputing age have been different in each census. (For more information on imputation, see Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.)    ANCESTRY --The data on ancestry were derived from answers to questionnaire item 13, which was asked of a sample of persons. The question was based on self-identification; the data on ancestry represent self-classification by people according to the ancestry group(s) with which they most closely identify. Ancestry refers to a person's ethnic origin or descent, ""roots,"" or heritage or the place of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. Some ethnic identities, such as ""Egyptian"" or ""Polish"" can be traced to geographic areas outside the United States, while other ethnicities such as ""Pennsylvania Dutch"" or ""Cajun"" evolved in the United States.   The intent of the ancestry question was not to measure the degree of attachment the respondent had to a particular ethnicity. For example, a response of ""Irish"" might reflect total involvement in an ""Irish"" community or only a memory of ancestors several generations removed from the individual.  The Census Bureau coded the responses through an automated review, edit, and coding operation. The open-ended write-in ancestry item was coded by subject-matter specialists into a numeric representation using a code list containing over 1,000 categories. The 1990 code list reflects the results of the Census Bureau's own research and consultations with many ethnic experts. Many decisions were made to determine the classification of responses. These decisions affected the grouping of the tabulated data. For example, the ""Assyrian"" category includes both responses of ""Assyrian"" and ""Chaldean.""   The ancestry question allowed respondents to report one or more ancestry groups. While a large number of respondents listed a single ancestry, the majority of answers included more than one ethnic entry. Generally, only the first two responses reported were coded in 1990. If a response was in terms of a dual ancestry, for example, Irish-English, the person was assigned two codes, in this case one for Irish and another for English.   However, in certain cases, multiple responses such as ""French Canadian,"" ""Scotch-Irish,"" ""Greek Cypriote,"" and ""Black Dutch"" were assigned a single code reflecting their status as unique groups. If a person reported one of these unique groups in addition to another group, for example, ""Scotch-Irish English,"" resulting in three terms, that person received one code for the unique group (""Scotch-Irish"") and another one for the remaining group (""English""). If a person reported ""English Irish French,"" only English and Irish were coded. Certain combinations of ancestries where the ancestry group is a part of another, such as ""German- Bavarian,"" the responses were coded as a single ancestry using the smaller group (""Bavarian""). Also, responses such as ""Polish-American"" or ""Italian-American"" were coded and tabulated as a single entry (""Polish"" or ""Italian"").   The Census Bureau accepted ""American"" as a unique ethnicity if it was given alone, with an ambiguous response, or with State names. If the respondent listed any other ethnic identity such as ""Italian American,"" generally the ""American"" portion of the response was not coded. However, distinct groups such as ""American Indian,"" ""Mexican American,"" and ""African American"" were coded and identified separately because they represented groups who considered themselves different from those who reported as ""Indian,"" ""Mexican,"" or ""African,"" respectively.   In all tabulations, when respondents provided an unacceptable ethnic identity (for example, an uncodeable or unintelligible response such as ""multi-national,"" ""adopted,"" or ""I have no idea""), the answer was included in ""Ancestry not reported.""   The tabulations on ancestry are presented using two types of data presentations--one used total persons as the base, and the other used total responses as the base. The following are categories shown in the two data presentations:   Presentation Based on Persons:     Single Ancestries Reported--Includes all persons who reported only one   ethnic group. Included in this category are persons with multiple-term   responses such as ""Scotch-Irish"" who are assigned a single code.     Multiple Ancestries Reported--Includes all persons who reported more than   one group and were assigned two ancestry codes.     Ancestry Unclassified--Includes all persons who provided a response that   could not be assigned an ancestry code because they provided nonsensical   entries or religious responses.   Presentations Based on Responses:     Total Ancestries Reported--Includes the total number of ancestries   reported and coded. If a person reported a multiple ancestry such as   ""French Danish,"" that response was counted twice in the tabulations--once   in the ""French"" category and again in the ""Danish"" category. Thus, the   sum of the counts in this type of presentation is not the total   population but the total of all responses.     First Ancestry Reported--Includes the first response of all persons who   reported at least one codeable entry. For example, in this category, the   count for ""Danish"" would include all those who reported only Danish and   those who reported Danish first and then some other group.     Second Ancestry Reported--Includes the second response of all persons who   reported a multiple ancestry. Thus, the count for ""Danish"" in this   category includes all persons who reported Danish as the second response,   regardless of the first response provided.   The Census Bureau identified hundreds of ethnic groups in the 1990 census. However, it was impossible to show information for every group in all census tabulations because of space constraints. Publications such as the 1990 CP-2, Social and Economic Characteristics and the 1990 CPH-3, Population and Housing Characteristics for Census Tracts and Block Numbering Areas reports show a limited number of groups based on the number reported and the advice received from experts. A more complete distribution of groups is presented in the 1990 Summary Tape File 4, supplementary reports, and a special subject report on ancestry. In addition, groups identified specifically in the questions on race and Hispanic origin (for example, Japanese, Laotian, Mexican, Cuban, and Spaniard), in general, are not shown separately in ancestry tabulations.   Limitation of the Data--Although some experts consider religious affiliation a component of ethnic identity, the ancestry question was not designed to collect any information concerning religion. The Bureau of the Census is prohibited from collecting information on religion. Thus, if a religion was given as an answer to the ancestry question, it was coded as an ""Other"" response.   Comparability--A question on ancestry was first asked in the 1980 census. Although there were no comparable data prior to the 1980 census, related information on ethnicity was collected through questions on parental birthplace, own birthplace, and language which were included in previous censuses. Unlike other census questions, there was no imputation for nonresponse to the ancestry question.   In 1990, respondents were allowed to report more than one ancestry group; however, only the first two ancestry groups identified were coded. In 1980, the Census Bureau attempted to code a third ancestry for selected triple-ancestry responses.   New categories such as ""Arab"" and ""West Indian"" were added to the 1990 question to meet important data needs. The ""West Indian"" category excluded ""Hispanic"" groups such as ""Puerto Rican"" and ""Cuban"" that were identified primarily through the question on Hispanic origin. In 1990, the ancestry group, ""American"" is recognized and tabulated as a unique ethnicity. In 1980, ""American"" was tabulated but included under the category ""Ancestry not specified.""  A major improvement in the 1990 census was the use of an automated coding system for ancestry responses. The automated coding system used in the 1990 census greatly reduced the potential for error associated with a clerical review. Specialists with a thorough knowledge of the subject matter reviewed, edited, coded, and resolved inconsistent or incomplete responses.    CITIZENSHIP --The data on citizenship were derived from answers to  questionnaire item 9, which was asked of a sample of persons.   Citizen--Persons who indicated that they were native-born and foreign-born persons who indicated that they have become naturalized. (For more information on native and foreign born, see the discussion under ""Place of Birth."")  There are four categories of citizenship: (1) born in the United States, (2) born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, (3) born abroad of American parents, and (4) citizen by naturalization.   Naturalized Citizen--Foreign-born persons who had completed the naturalization process at the time of the census and upon whom the rights of citizenship had been conferred.    Not a Citizen--Foreign-born persons who were not citizens, including persons who had begun but not completed the naturalization process at the time of the census.   Limitation of the Data--Evaluation studies completed after previous censuses indicated that some persons may have reported themselves as citizens although they had not yet attained the status.   Comparability--Similar questions on citizenship were asked in the censuses of 1820, 1830, 1870, 1890 through 1950, 1970, and 1980. The 1980 question was asked of a sample of the foreign-born population. In 1990, both native and foreign-born persons who received the long-form questionnaire were asked to respond to the citizenship question.    EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT --Data on educational attainment were derived from answers to questionnaire item 12, which was asked of a sample of persons. Data are tabulated as attainment for persons 15 years old and over. Persons are classified according to the highest level of school completed or the highest degree received. The question included instructions to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received for persons currently enrolled in school. The question included response categories which allowed persons to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma, and which instructed respondents to report as ""high school graduate(s)""--persons who received either a high school diploma or the equivalent, for example, passed the Test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.), and did not attend college. (On the Military Census Report questionnaire, the lowest response category was ""Less than 9th grade."")   Instructions included in the 1990 respondent instruction guide, which was mailed with the census questionnaire, further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system; that vocational certificates or diplomas from vocational, trade, or business schools or colleges were not to be reported unless they were college level degrees; and that honorary degrees were not to be reported. The instructions gave ""medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology"" as examples of professional school degrees, and specifically excluded ""barber school, cosmetology, or other training for a specific trade"" from the professional school category. The order in which they were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were ""higher"" than professional school degrees, which were ""higher"" than master's degrees.   Persons who did not report educational attainment were assigned the attainment of a person of the same age, race or Spanish origin, and sex who resided in the same or a nearby area. Persons who filled more than one circle were edited to the highest level or degree reported.   High School Graduate or Higher--Includes persons whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, persons who attended college or professional school, and persons who received a college, university, or professional degree. Persons who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included.  Not Enrolled, Not High School Graduate--Includes persons of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates; these persons may be taken to be ""high school dropouts."" There is no restriction on when they ""dropped out"" of school, and they may have never attended high school.   In prior censuses, ""Median school years completed"" was used as a summary measure of educational attainment. In 1990, the median can only be calculated for groups of which less than half the members have attended college. ""Percent high school graduate or higher"" and ""Percent bachelor's degree or higher"" are summary measures which can be calculated from the present data and offer quite readily interpretable measures of differences between population subgroups. To make comparisons over time, ""Percent high school graduate or higher"" can be calculated and ""Percent bachelor's degree or higher"" can be approximated with data from previous censuses.   Comparability--From 1840 to 1930, the census measured educational attainment by means of a basic literacy question. In 1940, a single question was asked on highest grade of school completed. In the censuses of 1950 through 1980, a two-part question asking highest grade of school attended and whether that grade was finished was used to construct highest grade or year of school completed. For persons who have not attended college, the response categories in the 1990 educational attainment question should produce data which are comparable to data on highest grade completed from earlier censuses.   The response categories for persons who have attended college were modified from earlier censuses because there was some ambiguity in interpreting responses in terms of the number of years of college completed. For instance, it was not clear whether ""completed the fourth year of college,"" ""completed the senior year of college,"" and ""college graduate"" were synonymous. Research conducted shortly before the census suggests that these terms were more distinct in 1990 than in earlier decades, and this change may have threatened the ability to estimate the number of ""college graduates"" from the number of persons reported as having completed the fourth or a higher year of college. It was even more difficult to make inferences about post-baccalaureate degrees and ""Associate"" degrees from highest year of college completed. Thus, comparisons of post-secondary educational attainment in this and earlier censuses should be made with great caution.   In the 1960 and subsequent censuses, persons for whom educational attainment was not reported were assigned the same attainment level as a similar person whose residence was in the same or a nearby area. In the 1940 and 1950 censuses, persons for whom educational attainment was not reported were not allocated.    EMPLOYMENT STATUS --The data on employment status were derived from answers to questionnaire items 21, 25, and 26, which were asked of a sample of persons. The series of questions on employment status was asked of all persons 15 years old and over and was designed to identify, in this sequence: (1) persons who worked at any time during the reference week; (2) persons who did not work during the reference week but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent (excluding layoff); (3) persons on layoff; and (4) persons who did not work during the reference week, but who were looking for work during the last four weeks and were available for work during the reference week. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Reference Week."")   The employment status data shown in this and other 1990 census tabulations relate to persons 16 years old and over. Some tabulations showing employment status, however, include persons 15 years old. By definition, these persons are classified as ""Not in Labor Force."". In the 1940, 1950, and 1960 censuses, employment status data were presented for persons 14 years old and over. The change in the universe was made in 1970 to agree with the official measurement of the labor force as revised in January 1967 by the U.S. Department of Labor. The 1970 census was the last to show employment data for persons 14 and 15 years old.   Employed--All civilians 16 years old and over who were either (1) ""at work""--those who did any work at all during the reference week as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession, worked on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a family farm or in a family business; or (2) were ""with a job but not at work""--those who did not work during the reference week but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons. Excluded from the employed are persons whose only activity consisted of work around the house or unpaid volunteer work for religious, charitable, and similar organizations; also excluded are persons on active duty in the United States Armed Forces.   Unemployed--All civilians 16 years old and over are classified as unemployed if they (1) were neither ""at work"" nor ""with a job but not at work"" during the reference week, and (2) were looking for work during the last 4 weeks, and (3) were available to accept a job. Also included as unemployed are civilians who did not work at all during the reference week and were waiting to be called back to a job from which they had been laid off. Examples of job seeking activities are:      Registering at a public or private employment office      Meeting with prospective employers      Investigating possibilities for starting a professional    practice or opening a business     Placing or answering advertisements      Writing letters of application      Being on a union or professional register  Civilian Labor Force--Consists of persons classified as employed or unemployed in accordance with the criteria described above.   Experienced Unemployed--These are unemployed persons who have worked at any time in the past.   Experienced Civilian Labor Force--Consists of the employed and the experienced unemployed.   Labor Force--All persons classified in the civilian labor force plus members of the U.S. Armed Forces (persons on active duty with the United States Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard).   Not in Labor Force--All persons 16 years old and over who are not classified as members of the labor force. This category consists mainly of students, housewives, retired workers, seasonal workers enumerated in an off season who were not looking for work, institutionalized persons, and persons doing only incidental unpaid family work (less than 15 hours during the reference week).   Worker--This term appears in connection with several subjects: journey-to- work items, class of worker, weeks worked in 1989, and number of workers in family in 1989. Its meaning varies and, therefore, should be determined in each case by referring to the definition of the subject in which it appears.   Actual Hours Worked Last Week--All persons who reported working during the reference week were asked to report in questionnaire item 21b the number of hours that they worked. The statistics on hours worked pertain to the number of hours actually worked at all jobs, and do not necessarily reflect the number of hours typically or usually worked or the scheduled number of hours.  The concept of ""actual hours"" differs from that of ""usual hours"" described below. The number of persons who worked only a small number of hours is probably understated since such persons sometimes consider themselves as not working. Respondents were asked to include overtime or extra hours worked, but to exclude lunch hours, sick leave, and vacation leave.   Limitation of the Data--The census may understate the number of employed persons because persons who have irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs sometimes report themselves as not working. The number of employed persons ""at work"" is probably overstated in the census (and conversely, the number of employed ""with a job, but not at work"" is understated) since some persons on vacation or sick leave erroneously reported themselves as working. This problem has no effect on the total number of employed persons. The reference week for the employment data is not the same for all persons. Since persons can change their employment status from one week to another, the lack of a uniform reference week may mean that the employment data do not reflect the reality of the employment situation of any given week. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Reference Week."")   Comparability--The questionnaire items and employment status concepts for the 1990 census are essentially the same as those used in the 1980 and 1970 censuses. However, these concepts differ in many respects from those associated with the 1950 and 1960 censuses.   Since employment data from the census are obtained from respondents in households, they differ from statistics based on reports from individual business establishments, farm enterprises, and certain government programs. Persons employed at more than one job are counted only once in the census and are classified according to the job at which they worked the greatest number of hours during the reference week. In statistics based on reports from business and farm establishments, persons who work for more than one establishment may be counted more than once. Moreover, some tabulations may exclude private household workers, unpaid family workers, and self-employed persons, but may include workers less than 16 years of age.   An additional difference in the data arises from the fact that persons who had a job but were not at work are included with the employed in the census statistics, whereas many of these persons are likely to be excluded from employment figures based on establishment payroll reports. Furthermore, the employment status data in census tabulations include persons on the basis of place of residence regardless of where they work, whereas establishment data report persons at their place of work regardless of where they live. This latter consideration is particularly significant when comparing data for workers who commute between areas.  Census data on actual hours worked during the reference week may differ from data from other sources. The census measures hours actually worked, whereas some surveys measure hours paid for by employers. Comparability of census actual hours worked data may also be affected by the nature of the reference week (see ""Reference Week"").   For several reasons, the unemployment figures of the Census Bureau are not comparable with published figures on unemployment compensation claims. For example, figures on unemployment compensation claims exclude persons who have exhausted their benefit rights, new workers who have not earned rights to unemployment insurance, and persons losing jobs not covered by unemployment insurance systems (including some workers in agriculture, domestic services, and religious organizations, and self-employed and unpaid family workers). In addition, the qualifications for drawing unemployment compensation differ from the definition of unemployment used by the Census Bureau. Persons working only a few hours during the week and persons with a job but not at work are sometimes eligible for unemployment compensation but are classified as ""Employed"" in the census. Differences in the geographical distribution of unemployment data arise because the place where claims are filed may not necessarily be the same as the place of residence of the unemployed worker.   The figures on employment status from the decennial census are generally comparable with similar data collected in the Current Population Survey. However, some difference may exist because of variations in enumeration and processing techniques.    FERTILITY --The data on fertility (also referred to as ""children ever born"") were derived from answers to questionnaire item 20, which was asked of a sample of women 15 years old and over regardless of marital status. Stillbirths, stepchildren, and adopted children were excluded from the number of children ever born. Ever-married women were instructed to include all children born to them before and during their most recent marriage, children no longer living, and children away from home, as well as children who were still living in the home.  Never-married women were instructed to include all children born to them.   Data are most frequently presented in terms of the aggregate number of children ever born to women in the specified category and in terms of the rate per 1,000 women. For purposes of calculating the aggregate, the open-ended response category, ""12 or more"" is assigned a value of 13.   Limitation of the Data--Although the data are assumed to be less complete for out-of-wedlock births than for births occurring within marriage, comparisons of 1980 census data on the fertility of single women with other census sources and administrative records indicate that no significant differences were found between different data sources; that is, 1980 census data on children ever born to single women were complete with no significant understatements of childbearing.   Comparability--The wording of the question on children ever born was the same in 1990 as in 1980. In 1970, however, the question on children ever born was asked of all ever-married women but only of never-married women who received self-administered questionnaires. Therefore, rates and numbers of children ever born to single women in 1970 may be understated. Data presented for children ever born to ever-married women are comparable for the 1990 census and all previous censuses containing this question.   GROUP QUARTERS --All persons not living in households are classified by the Census Bureau as living in group quarters. Two general categories of persons in group quarters are recognized:    (1) institutionalized persons and    (2) other persons in group quarters (also referred to as       ""noninstitutional group quarters"").   Institutionalized Persons--Includes persons under formally authorized, supervised care or custody in institutions at the time of enumeration. Such persons are classified as ""patients or inmates"" of an institution regardless of the availability of nursing or medical care, the length of stay, or the number of persons in the institution. Generally, institutionalized persons are restricted to the institutional buildings and grounds (or must have passes or escorts to leave) and thus have limited interaction with the surrounding community. Also, they are generally under the care of trained staff who have responsibility for their safekeeping and supervision.    Type of Institution--The type of institution was determined as part of census enumeration activities. For institutions which specialize in only one specific type of service, all patients or inmates were given the same classification.  For institutions which had multiple types of major services (usually general hospitals and Veterans' Administration hospitals), patients were classified according to selected types of wards. For example, in psychiatric wards of hospitals, patients were classified in ""mental (psychiatric) hospitals""; in hospital wards for persons with chronic diseases, patients were classified in ""hospitals for the chronically ill."" Each patient or inmate was classified in only one type of institution. Institutions include the following types:      Correctional Institutions--Includes prisons, Federal    detention centers, military stockades and jails, police lockups,    halfway houses, local jails, and other confinement facilities,    including work farms.      Prisons--Where persons convicted of crimes serve their    sentences. In some census products, the prisons are classified by two    types of control:       (1) ""Federal"" (operated by the Bureau of  Prisons of the Department      of Justice) and (2) ""State."" Residents who are criminally insane were      classified on the basis of where they resided at the time of      enumeration: (1) in institutions (or hospital wards) operated by      departments of correction or similar agencies; or       (2) in institutions operated by departments of mental health or      similar agencies.      Federal Detention Centers--Operated by the Immigration    and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Bureau of Prisons. These    facilities include detention centers used by the Park Police; Bureau of    Indian Affairs Detention Centers; INS Centers, such as the INS Federal    Alien Detention Facility; INS Processing Centers; and INS Contract    Detention Centers used to detain aliens under exclusion or deportation    proceedings, as well as those aliens who have not been placed into    proceedings, such as custodial required departures; and INS Detention    Centers operated within local jails, and State and Federal prisons.      Military Stockades, Jails--Operated by military police    and used to hold persons awaiting trial or convicted of violating    military laws.      Local Jails and Other Confinement Facilities--Includes    facilities operated by counties and cities that primarily hold persons    beyond arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours. Also included in    this category are work farms used to hold persons awaiting trial or    serving time on relatively short sentences and jails run by private    businesses under contract for local governments (but not by    State governments).      Police Lockups--Temporary-holding facilities operated    by county and city police that hold persons for 48 hours or less only    if they have not been formally charged in court.      Halfway Houses--Operated for correctional purposes and include    probation and restitution centers, pre- release centers, and    community-residential centers.      Other Types of Correctional Institutions--Privately    operated correctional facilities and correctional facilities    specifically for alcohol/drug abuse.   Nursing Homes--Comprises a heterogeneous group of places. The majority of patients are elderly, although persons who require nursing care because of chronic physical conditions may be found in these homes regardless of their age. Included in this category are skilled-nursing facilities, intermediate-care facilities, long-term care rooms in wards or buildings on the grounds of hospitals, or long-term care rooms/nursing wings in congregate housing facilities. Also included are nursing, convalescent, and rest homes, such as soldiers', sailors', veterans', and fraternal or religious homes for the aged, with or without nursing care. In some census products, nursing homes are classified by type of ownership as ""Federal,"" ""State,"" ""Private not-for-profit,"" and ""Private for profit.""   Mental (Psychiatric) Hospitals--Includes hospitals or wards for the criminally insane not operated by a prison, and psychiatric wards of general hospitals and veterans' hospitals. Patients receive supervised medical/nursing care from formally-trained staff. In some census products, mental hospitals are classified by type of ownership as ""Federal,"" ""State or local,"" ""Private,"" and ""Ownership not known.""   Hospitals for Chronically Ill--Includes hospitals for patients who require long-term care, including those in military hospitals and wards for the chronically ill located on military bases; or other hospitals or wards for the chronically ill, which include tuberculosis hospitals or wards, wards in general and Veterans' Administration hospitals for the chronically ill, neurological wards, hospices, wards for patients with Hansen's Disease (leprosy) and other incurable diseases, and other unspecified wards for the chronically ill. Patients who had no usual home elsewhere were enumerated as part of the institutional population in the wards of general and military hospitals. Most hospital patients are at the hospital temporarily and were enumerated at their usual place of residence. (For more information, see ""Wards in General and Military Hospitals for Patients Who Have No Usual Home Elsewhere."")   Schools, Hospitals, or Wards for the Mentally Retarded--Includes those institutions such as wards in hospitals for the mentally retarded, and intermediate-care facilities for the mentally retarded that provide supervised medical/nursing care from formally-trained staff. In some census products, this category is classified by type of ownership as ""Federal,"" ""State or local,"" ""Private,"" and ""Ownership not known.""   Schools, Hospitals, or Wards for the Physically Handicapped--Includes three types of institutions: institutions for the blind, those for the deaf, and orthopedic wards and institutions for the physically handicapped. Institutions for persons with speech problems are classified with ""institutions for the deaf."" The category ""orthopedic wards and institutions for the physically handicapped"" includes those institutions providing relatively long-term care to accident victims, and to persons with polio, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy. In some census products, this category is classified by type of ownership as ""Public,"" ""Private,"" and ""Ownership not known.""   Hospitals, and Wards for Drug/Alcohol Abuse--Includes hospitals, and hospital wards in psychiatric and general hospitals.  These facilities are equipped medically and designed for the diagnosis and treatment of medical or psychiatric illnesses associated with alcohol or drug abuse. Patients receive supervised medical care from formally-trained staff.   Wards in General and Military Hospitals for Patients Who Have No Usual Home Elsewhere--Includes maternity, neonatal, pediatric (including wards for boarder babies), military, and surgical wards of hospitals, and wards for persons with infectious diseases.   Juvenile Institutions--Includes homes, schools, and other institutions providing care for children (short- or long-term care). Juvenile institutions include the following types:      Homes for Abused, Dependent, and Neglected Children--Includes    orphanages and other institutions which provide long-term care    (usually more than 30 days) for children. This category    is classified in some census products by type of ownership as    ""Public"" and ""Private.""      Residential Treatment Centers--Includes those institutions which    primarily serve children who, by clinical diagnosis, are moderately    or seriously disturbed emotionally. Also, these institutions provide    long-term treatment services, usually supervised or directed by a    psychiatrist.      Training Schools for Juvenile Delinquents--Includes residential    training schools or homes, and industrial schools, camps, or farms for    juvenile delinquents.      Public Training Schools for Juvenile Delinquents--Usually operated by    a State agency (for example, department of welfare, corrections, or a    youth authority). Some are operated by county and city governments.    These public training schools are specialized institutions serving    delinquent children, generally between the ages of 10 and 17 years    old, all of whom are committed by the courts.      Private Training Schools--Operated under private auspices. Some of the    children they serve are committed by the courts as delinquents. Others    are referred by parents or social agencies because of delinquent    behavior. One difference between private and public training schools    is that, by their administrative policy, private schools have control    over their selection and intake.   Detention Centers--Includes institutions providing short-term care (usually 30 days or less) primarily for delinquent children pending disposition of their cases by a court. This category also covers diagnostic centers. In practice, such institutions may be caring for both delinquent and neglected children pending court disposition.    Other Persons in Group Quarters (also referred to as ""noninstitutional group quarters"")--Includes all persons who live in group quarters other than institutions. Persons who live in the following living quarters are classified as ""other persons in group quarters"" when there are 10 or more unrelated persons living in the unit; otherwise, these living quarters are classified as housing units.   Rooming Houses--Includes persons residing in rooming and boarding houses and living in quarters with 10 or more unrelated persons.   Group Homes--Includes ""community-based homes"" that provide care and supportive services. Such places include homes for the mentally ill, mentally retarded, and physically handicapped; drug/alcohol halfway houses; communes; and maternity homes for unwed mothers.   Homes for the Mentally Ill--Includes community-based homes that provide care primarily for the mentally ill. In some data products, this category is classified by type of ownership as ""Federal,"" ""State,"" ""Private,"" and ""Ownership not known."" Homes which combine treatment of the physically handicapped with treatment of the mentally ill are counted as homes for the mentally ill.   Homes for the Mentally Retarded--Includes community-based homes that provide care primarily for the mentally retarded. Homes which combine treatment of the physically handicapped with treatment of the mentally retarded are counted as homes for the mentally retarded.  This category is classified by type of ownership in some census products, as ""Federal,"" ""State,"" ""Private,"" or ""Ownership not known.""   Homes for the Physically Handicapped--Includes community-based homes for the blind, for the deaf, and other community-based homes for the physically handicapped. Persons with speech problems are classified with homes for the deaf. In some census products, this category is classified by type of ownership as ""Public,"" ""Private,"" or ""Ownership not known.""   Homes or Halfway Houses for Drug/Alcohol Abuse--Includes persons with no usual home elsewhere in places that provide community-based care and supportive services to persons suffering from a drug/alcohol addiction and to recovering alcoholics and drug abusers. Places providing community-based care for drug and alcohol abusers include group homes, detoxification centers, quarterway houses (residential treatment facilities that work closely with accredited hospitals), halfway houses, and recovery homes for ambulatory, mentally competent recovering alcoholics and drug abusers who may be re-entering the work force.   Maternity Homes for Unwed Mothers--Includes persons with no usual home elsewhere in places that provide domestic care for unwed mothers and their children. These homes may provide social services and post-natal care within the facility, or may make arrangements for women to receive such services in the community.  Nursing services are usually available in the facility.    Other Group Homes--Includes persons with no usual home elsewhere in communes, foster care homes, and job corps centers with 10 or more unrelated persons. These types of places provide communal living quarters, generally for persons who have formed their own community in which they have common interests and often share or own property jointly.   Religious Group Quarters--Includes, primarily, group quarters for nuns teaching in parochial schools and for priests living in rectories. It also includes other convents and monasteries, except those associated with a general hospital or an institution.    College Quarters Off Campus--Includes privately-owned rooming and boarding houses off campus, if the place is reserved exclusively for occupancy by college students and if there are 10 or more unrelated persons. In census products, persons in this category are classified as living in a college dormitory.   Persons residing in certain other types of living arrangements are classified as living in ""noninstitutional group quarters"" regardless of the number of people sharing the unit. These include persons residing in the following types of group quarters:      College Dormitories--Includes college students in    dormitories (provided the dormitory is restricted to students who do    not have their families living with them), fraternity and sorority    houses, and on-campus residential quarters used exclusively for those    in religious orders who are attending college. Students in    privately-owned rooming and boarding houses off campus are also    included, if the place is reserved exclusively for occupancy by    college-level students and if there are 10 or more unrelated persons.      Military Quarters--Includes military personnel living    in barracks and dormitories on base, in transient quarters on base for    temporary residents (both civilian and military), and on military    ships. However, patients in military hospitals receiving treatment for    chronic diseases or who had no usual home elsewhere, and persons being    held in military stockades were included as part of the institutional    population.      Agriculture Workers' Dormitories--Includes persons in    migratory farm workers' camps on farms, bunkhouses for ranch hands, and    other dormitories on farms, such as those on ""tree farms.""      Other Workers' Dormitories--Includes persons in logging    camps, construction workers' camps, firehouse dormitories, job-training    camps, energy enclaves (Alaska only), and nonfarm migratory workers'    camps (for example, workers in mineral and mining camps).      Emergency Shelters for Homeless Persons (with sleeping    facilities) and Visible in Street Locations--Includes persons    enumerated during the ""Shelter-and-Street-Night"" operation primarily on    March 20-21, 1990. Enumerators were instructed not to ask if a person    was ""homeless."" If a person was at one of the locations below on March    20-21, the person was counted as described below. (For more information    on the ""Shelter-and-Street-Night"" operation, see Appendix D, Collection    and Processing Procedures.) This category is divided into four    classifications:        Emergency Shelters for Homeless Persons (with sleeping      facilities)--Includes persons who stayed overnight on March 20,      1990, in permanent and temporary emergency housing, missions,      hotels/motels, and flophouses charging $12 or less (excluding taxes)      per night; Salvation Army shelters, hotels, and motels used      entirely for homeless persons regardless of the nightly rate      charged; rooms in hotels and motels used partially for the      homeless; and similar places known to have persons who have no usual      home elsewhere staying overnight. If not shown separately, shelters      and group homes that provide temporary sleeping facilities for      runaway, neglected, and homeless children are included in this        category in data products.        Shelters for Runaway, Neglected, and Homeless Children--Includes      shelters/group homes which provide temporary sleeping facilities for      juveniles.    Visible in Street Locations--Includes street blocks and open public locations designated before March 20, 1990, by city and community officials as places where the homeless congregate at night. All persons found at predesignated street sites from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. and leaving abandoned or boarded-up buildings from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. on March 21, 1990, were enumerated during ""street"" enumeration, except persons in uniform such as police and persons engaged in obvious money-making activities other than begging or panhandling. Enumerators were instructed not to ask if a person was ""homeless.""   This cannot be considered a complete count of all persons living on the streets because those who were so well hidden that local people did not know where to find them were likely to have been missed as were persons moving about or in places not identified by local officials. It is also possible that persons with homes could have been included in the count of ""visible in street locations"" if they were present when the enumerator did the enumeration of a particular block.   Predesignated street sites include street corners, parks, bridges, persons emerging from abandoned and boarded-up buildings, noncommercial campsites (tent cities), all-night movie theaters, all-night restaurants, emergency hospital waiting rooms, train stations, airports, bus depots, and subway stations.   Shelters for Abused Women (Shelters Against Domestic Violence or Family Crisis Centers)--Includes community-based homes or shelters that provide domiciliary care for women who have sought shelter from family violence and who may have been physically abused. Most shelters also provide care for children of abused women.  These shelters may provide social services, meals, psychiatric treatment, and counseling. In some census products, ""shelters for abused women"" are included in the category ""other noninstitutional group quarters.""   Dormitories for Nurses and Interns in General and Military Hospitals--Includes group quarters for nurses and other staff members. It excludes patients.   Crews of Maritime Vessels--Includes officers, crew members, and passengers of maritime U.S. flag vessels. All ocean-going and Great Lakes ships are included.    Staff Residents of Institutions--Includes staff residing in group quarters on institutional grounds who provide formally-authorized, supervised care or custody for the institutionalized population.   Other Nonhousehold Living Situations--Includes persons with no usual home elsewhere enumerated during transient or ""T-Night"" enumeration at YMCA's, YWCA's, youth hostels, commercial and government-run campgrounds, campgrounds at racetracks, fairs, and carnivals, and similar transient sites.   Living Quarters for Victims of Natural Disasters--Includes living quarters for persons temporarily displaced by natural disasters.   Limitation of the Data--Two types of errors can occur in the classification of ""types of group quarters"":      Misclassification of Group Quarters--During the 1990 Special Place    Prelist operation, the enumerator determined the type of group quarters    associated with each special place in their assignment.  The enumerator    used the Alphabetical Group Quarters Code List and Index to the    Alphabetical Group Quarters Code List to assign a two-digit code    number followed by either an ""I,"" for institutional, or an    ""N,"" for noninstitutional to each group quarters. In 1990,    unacceptable group quarter codes were edited. (For more information on    editing of unacceptable data, see Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.)     No Classification (unknowns)--The imputation rate for type of    institution was higher in 1980 (23.5 percent) than in 1970 (3.3    percent). Improvements were made to the 1990 Alphabetical Group    Quarters Code List; that is, the inclusion of more group quarters    categories and an ""Index to the Alphabetical Group Quarters Code    List."" (For more information on the allocation rates for Type of    Institution, see the allocation rates in 1990 CP-1, General    Population Characteristics.)   In previous censuses, allocation rates for demographic characteristics (such as age, sex, race, and marital status) of the institutional population were similar to those for the total population. The allocation rates for sample characteristics such as school enrollment, highest grade completed, income, and veteran status for the institutional and noninstitutional group quarters population have been substantially higher than the population in households at least as far back as the 1960 census. The data, however, have historically presented a reasonable picture of the institutional and noninstitutional group quarters population.   Shelter and Street Night (S-Night)--For the 1990 census ""Shelter-and- Street-Night"" operation, persons well hidden, moving about, or in locations enumerators did not visit were likely to be missed. The number of people missed will never be known; thus, the 1990 census cannot be considered to include a definitive count of America's total homeless population. It does, however, give an idea of relative differences among areas of the country. Other components were counted as part of regular census procedures.   The count of persons in shelters and visible on the street could have been affected by many factors. How much the factors affected the count can never be answered definitively, but some elements include:  How well enumerators were trained and how well they followed procedures.  How well the list of shelter and street locations given to the Census Bureau by the local government reflected the actual places that homeless persons stay at night.  Cities were encouraged to open temporary shelters for census night, and many did that and actively encouraged people to enter the shelters. Thus, people who may have been on the street otherwise were in shelters the night of March 20, so that the ratio of shelter-to-street population could be different than usual.  The weather, which was unusually cold in some parts of the country, could affect how likely people were to seek emergency shelter or to be more hidden than usual if they stayed outdoors.  The media occasionally interfered with the ability to do the count.  How homeless people perceived the census and whether they wanted to be counted or feared the census and hid from it.  The Census Bureau conducted two assessments of Shelter and Street Night: (1) the quality of the lists of shelters used for the Shelter-and-Street-Night operation, and (2) how well procedures were followed by census- takers for the street count in parts of five cities (Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, and Phoenix). Information about these two assessments is available from the Chief, Center for Survey Methods Research, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.  Comparability--For the 1990 census, the definition of institutionalized persons was revised so that the definition of ""care"" only includes persons under organized medical or formally-authorized, supervised care or custody. As a result of this change to the institutional definition, maternity homes are classified as noninstitutional rather than institutional group quarters as in previous censuses. The following types of other group quarters are classified as institutional rather than noninstitutional group quarters: ""halfway houses (operated for correctional purposes)"" and ""wards in general and military hospitals for patients who have no usual home elsewhere,"" which includes maternity, neonatal, pediatric, military, and surgical wards of hospitals, other-purpose wards of hospitals, and wards for infectious diseases. These changes should not significantly affect the comparability of data with earlier censuses because of the relatively small number of persons involved.   As in 1980, 10 or more unrelated persons living together were classified as living in noninstitutional group quarters. In 1970, the criteria was six or more unrelated persons.   Several changes also have occurred in the identification of specific types of group quarters. For the first time, the 1990 census identifies separately the following types of correctional institutions: persons in halfway houses (operated for correctional purposes), military stockades and jails, and police lockups. In 1990, tuberculosis hospitals or wards are included with hospitals for the chronically ill; in 1980, they were shown separately. For 1990, the noninstitutional group quarters category, ""Group homes"" is further classified as: group homes for drug/alcohol abuse; maternity homes (for unwed mothers), group homes for the mentally ill, group homes for the mentally retarded, and group homes for the physically handicapped. Persons living in communes, foster-care homes, and job corps centers are classified with ""Other group homes"" only if 10 or more unrelated persons share the unit; otherwise, they are classified as housing units.   In 1990, workers' dormitories were classified as group quarters regardless of the number of persons sharing the dorm. In 1980, 10 or more unrelated persons had to share the dorm for it to be classified as a group quarters. In 1960, data on persons in military barracks were shown only for men. In subsequent censuses, they include both men and women.   In 1990 census data products, the phrase ""inmates of institutions"" was changed to ""institutionalized persons."" Also, persons living in noninstitutional group quarters were referred to as ""other persons in group quarters,"" and the phrase ""staff residents"" was used for staff living in institutions.  In 1990, there are additional institutional categories and noninstitutional group quarters categories compared with the 1980 census. The institutional categories added include ""hospitals and wards for drug/alcohol abuse"" and ""military hospitals for the chronically ill."" The noninstitutional group quarters categories added include emergency shelters for homeless persons; shelters for runaway, neglected, and homeless children; shelters for abused women; and visible-in-street locations. Each of these noninstitutional group quarters categories was enumerated on March 20-21, 1990, during the ""Shelter-and-Street-Night"" operation. (For more information on the ""Shelter-and-Street-Night"" operation, see Appendix D, Collection and Processing Procedures.)    HISPANIC ORIGIN --The data on Spanish/Hispanic origin were derived from answers to questionnaire item 7, which was asked of all persons. Persons of Hispanic origin are those who classified themselves in one of the specific Hispanic origin categories listed on the questionnaire--""Mexican,"" ""Puerto Rican,"" or ""Cuban""--as well as those who indicated that they were of ""other Spanish/Hispanic"" origin. Persons of ""Other Spanish/Hispanic"" origin are those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, or the Dominican Republic, or they are persons of Hispanic origin identifying themselves generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on. Write-in responses to the ""other Spanish/Hispanic"" category were coded only for sample data.   Origin can be viewed as the ancestry, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.   Some tabulations are shown by the Hispanic origin of the householder. In all cases where households, families, or occupied housing units are classified by Hispanic origin, the Hispanic origin of the householder is used. (See the discussion of householder under ""Household Type and Relationship."")   During direct interviews conducted by enumerators, if a person could not provide a single origin response, he or she was asked to select, based on self-identification, the group which best described his or her origin or descent. If a person could not provide a single group, the origin of the person's mother was used. If a single group could not be provided for the person's mother, the first origin reported by the person was used.   If any household member failed to respond to the Spanish/Hispanic origin question, a response was assigned by the computer according to the reported entries of other household members by using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. In the processing of sample questionnaires, responses to other questions on the questionnaire, such as ancestry and place of birth, were used to assign an origin before any reference was made to the origin reported by other household members. If an origin was not entered for any household member, an origin was assigned from another household according to the race of the householder. This procedure is a variation of the general imputation process described in Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.   Comparability--There may be differences between the total Hispanic origin population based on 100-percent tabulations and sample tabulations. Such differences are the result of sampling variability, nonsampling error, and more extensive edit procedures for the Spanish/Hispanic origin item on the sample questionnaires. (For more information on sampling variability and nonsampling error, see Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.)   The 1990 data on Hispanic origin are generally comparable with those for the 1980 census. However, there are some differences in the format of the Hispanic origin question between the two censuses. For 1990, the word ""descent"" was deleted from the 1980 wording. In addition, the term ""Mexican-Amer."" used in 1980 was shortened further to ""Mexican-Am."" to reduce misreporting (of ""American"") in this category detected in the 1980 census. Finally, the 1990 question allowed those who reported as ""other Spanish/Hispanic"" to write in their specific Hispanic origin group.   Misreporting in the ""Mexican-Amer."" category of the 1980 census item on Spanish/Hispanic origin may affect the comparability of 1980 and 1990 census data for persons of Hispanic origin for certain areas of the country. An evaluation of the 1980 census item on Spanish/Hispanic origin indicated that there was misreporting in the Mexican origin category by White and Black persons in certain areas. The study results showed evidence that the misreporting occurred in the South (excluding Texas), the Northeast (excluding the New York City area), and a few States in the Midwest Region. Also, results based on available data suggest that the impact of possible misreporting of Mexican origin in the 1980 census was severe in those portions of the above-mentioned regions where the Hispanic origin population was generally sparse. However, national 1980 census data on the Mexican origin population or total Hispanic origin population at the national level was not seriously affected by the reporting problem. (For a more detailed discussion of the evaluation of the 1980 census Spanish/Hispanic origin item, see the 1980 census Supplementary Reports.)   The 1990 and 1980 census data on the Hispanic population are not directly comparable with 1970 Spanish origin data because of a number of factors: (1) overall improvements in the 1980 and 1990 censuses, (2) better coverage of the population, (3) improved question designs, and (4) an effective public relations campaign by the Census Bureau with the assistance of national and community ethnic groups.   Specific changes in question design between the 1980 and 1970 censuses included the placement of the category ""No, not Spanish/Hispanic"" as the first category in that question. (The corresponding category appeared last in the 1970 question.) Also, the 1970 category ""Central or South American"" was deleted because in 1970 some respondents misinterpreted the category; furthermore, the designations ""Mexican-American"" and ""Chicano"" were added to the Spanish/Hispanic origin question in 1980. In the 1970 census, the question on Spanish origin was asked of only a 5-percent sample of the population.    HOUSEHOLD TYPE AND RELATIONSHIP   Household--A household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit. A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements.   In 100-percent tabulations, the count of households or householders always equals the count of occupied housing units. In sample tabulations, the numbers may differ as a result of the weighting process.   Persons Per Household--A measure obtained by dividing the number of persons in households by the number of households (or householders). In cases where persons in households are cross-classified by race or Hispanic origin, persons in the household are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual.  Relationship to Householder  Householder--The data on relationship to householder were derived from answers to questionnaire item 2, which was asked of all persons in housing units.  One person in each household is designated as the householder. In most cases, this is the person, or one of the persons, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented and who is listed in column 1 of the census questionnaire. If there is no such person in the household, any adult household member 15 years old and over could be designated as the householder.   Households are classified by type according to the sex of the householder and the presence of relatives. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family householder and a nonfamily householder. A family householder is a householder living with one or more persons related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all persons in the household related to him or her are family members. A nonfamily householder is a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only.   Spouse--Includes a person married to and living with a householder. This category includes persons in formal marriages, as well as persons in common-law marriages.   The number of spouses is equal to the number of ""married-couple families"" or ""married-couple households"" in 100-percent tabulations. The number of spouses, however, is generally less than half of the number of ""married persons with spouse present"" in sample tabulations, since more than one married couple can live in a household, but only spouses of householders are specifically identified as ""spouse."" For sample tabulations, the number of ""married persons with spouse present"" includes married-couple subfamilies and married-couple families.   Child--Includes a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or adopted child of the householder, regardless of the child's age or marital status. The category excludes sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and foster children.   Natural-Born or Adopted Son/Daughter--A son or daughter of the householder by birth, regardless of the age of the child. Also, this category includes sons or daughters of the householder by legal adoption, regardless of the age of the child. If the stepson/stepdaughter of the householder has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is still classified as a stepchild.   Stepson/Stepdaughter--A son or daughter of the householder through marriage but not by birth, regardless of the age of the child. If the stepson/stepdaughter of the householder has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is still classified as a stepchild.   Own Child--A never-married child under 18 years who is a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or an adopted child of the householder. In certain tabulations, own children are further classified as living with two parents or with one parent only. Own children of the householder living with two parents are by definition found only in married-couple families.   In a subfamily, an ""own child"" is a never-married child under 18 years of age who is a son, daughter, stepchild, or an adopted child of a mother in a mother-child subfamily, a father in a father-child subfamily, or either spouse in a married-couple subfamily.   ""Related children"" in a family include own children and all other persons under 18 years of age in the household, regardless of marital status, who are related to the householder, except the spouse of the householder. Foster children are not included since they are not related to the householder.   Other Relatives--In tabulations, includes any household member related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption, but not included specifically in another relationship category. In certain detailed tabulations, the following categories may be shown:   Grandchild--The grandson or granddaughter of the householder.   Brother/Sister--The brother or sister of the householder, including stepbrothers, stepsisters, and brothers and sisters by adoption. Brothers- in-law and sisters-in-law are included in the ""Other relative"" category on the questionnaire.   Parent--The father or mother of the householder, including a stepparent or adoptive parent. Fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law are included in the ""Other relative"" category on the questionnaire.   Other Relatives--Anyone not listed in a reported category above who is related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption (brother-in-law, grandparent, nephew, aunt, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, cousin, and so forth).  Nonrelatives--Includes any household member, including foster children not related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The following categories may be presented in more detailed tabulations:     Roomer, Boarder, or Foster Child--Roomer, boarder, lodger, and foster    children or foster adults of the householder.       Housemate or Roommate--A person who is not related to the householder    and who shares living quarters primarily in order to share expenses.      Unmarried Partner--A person who is not related to the householder, who    shares living quarters, and who has a close personal relationship with    the householder.      Other Nonrelatives--A person who is not related by birth, marriage, or    adoption to the householder and who is not described by the categories    given above.   When relationship is not reported for an individual, it is imputed according to the responses for age, sex, and marital status for that person while maintaining consistency with responses for other individuals in the household. (For more information on imputation, see Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.)   Unrelated Individual--An unrelated individual is: (1) a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only, (2) a household member who is not related to the householder, or (3) a person living in group quarters who is not an inmate of an institution.   Family Type--A family consists of a householder and one or more other persons living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All persons in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations. Not all households contain families since a household may comprise a group of unrelated persons or one person living alone.   Families are classified by type as either a ""married-couple family"" or ""other family"" according to the sex of the householder and the presence of relatives. The data on family type are based on answers to questions on sex and relationship which were asked on a 100-percent basis.   Married-Couple Family--A family in which the householder and his or her spouse are enumerated as members of the same household.   Other Family:      Male Householder, No Wife Present--A family with a male    householder and no spouse of householder present.      Female Householder, No Husband Present--A family with a    female householder and no spouse of householder present.   Persons Per Family--A measure obtained by dividing the number of persons in families by the total number of families (or family householders). In cases where the measure, ""persons in family"" or ""persons per family"" are cross-tabulated by race or Hispanic origin, the race or Hispanic origin refers to the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual.   Subfamily--A subfamily is a married couple (husband and wife enumerated as members of the same household) with or without never-married children under 18 years old, or one parent with one or more never-married children under 18 years old, living in a household and related to, but not including, either the householder or the householder's spouse. The number of subfamilies is not included in the count of families, since subfamily members are counted as part of the householder's family.   Subfamilies are defined during processing of sample data. In selected tabulations, subfamilies are further classified by type: married-couple subfamilies, with or without own children; mother-child subfamilies; and father-child subfamilies.   Lone parents include people maintaining either one-parent families or one- parent subfamilies. Married couples include husbands and wives in both married-couple families and married-couple subfamilies.   Unmarried-Partner Household--An unmarried-partner household is a household other than a ""married-couple household"" that includes a householder and an ""unmarried partner."" An ""unmarried partner"" can be of the same sex or of the opposite sex of the householder. An ""unmarried partner"" in an ""unmarried- partner household"" is an adult who is unrelated to the householder, but shares living quarters and has a close personal relationship with the householder.   Unmarried-Couple Household--An unmarried-couple household is composed of two unrelated adults of the opposite sex (one of whom is the householder) who share a housing unit with or without the presence of children under 15 years old.   Foster Children--Foster children are nonrelatives of the householder and are included in the category, ""Roomer, boarder, or foster child"" on the questionnaire. Foster children are identified as persons under 18 years old and living in households that have no nonrelatives 18 years old and over (who might be parents of the nonrelatives under 18 years old).   Stepfamily--A stepfamily is a ""married-couple family"" with at least one stepchild of the householder present, where the householder is the husband.   Comparability--The 1990 definition of a household is the same as that used in 1980.  The 1980 relationship category ""Son/daughter"" has been replaced by two categories, ""Natural-born or adopted son/daughter"" and ""Stepson/ stepdaughter."" ""Grandchild"" has been added as a separate category. The 1980 nonrelative categories: ""Roomer, boarder"" and ""Partner, roommate"" have been replaced by the categories ""Roomer, boarder, or foster child,"" ""Housemate, roommate,"" and ""Unmarried partner."" The 1980 nonrelative category ""Paid employee"" has been dropped.    INCOME IN 1989 --The data on income in 1989 were derived from answers to questionnaire items 32 and 33. Information on money income received in the calendar year 1989 was requested from persons 15 years old and over. ""Total income"" is the algebraic sum of the amounts reported separately for wage or salary income; net nonfarm self-employment income; net farm self-employment income; interest, dividend, or net rental or royalty income; Social Security or railroad retirement income; public assistance or welfare income; retirement or disability income; and all other income. ""Earnings"" is defined as the algebraic sum of wage or salary income and net income from farm and nonfarm self-employment. ""Earnings"" represent the amount of income received regularly before deductions for personal income taxes, Social Security, bond purchases, union dues, medicare deductions, etc.   Receipts from the following sources are not included as income: money received from the sale of property (unless the recipient was engaged in the business of selling such property); the value of income ""in kind"" from food stamps, public housing subsidies, medical care, employer contributions for persons, etc.; withdrawal of bank deposits; money borrowed; tax refunds; exchange of money between relatives living in the same household; gifts and lump-sum inheritances, insurance payments, and other types of lump-sum receipts.   Income Type in 1989--The eight types of income reported in the census are defined as follows:      Wage or Salary Income--Includes total money earnings    received for work performed as an employee during the calendar year    1989. It includes wages, salary, Armed Forces pay, commissions, tips,    piece-rate payments, and cash bonuses earned before deductions were made    for taxes, bonds, pensions, union dues, etc.      Nonfarm Self-Employment Income--Includes net money income (gross    receipts minus expenses) from one's own business, professional    enterprise, or partnership. Gross receipts include the value of all    goods sold and services rendered. Expenses includes costs of goods    purchased, rent, heat, light, power, depreciation charges, wages and    salaries paid, business taxes (not personal income taxes), etc.      Farm Self-Employment Income--Includes net money income (gross receipts    minus operating expenses) from the operation of a farm by a person on    his or her own account, as an owner, renter, or sharecropper. Gross    receipts include the value of all products sold, government farm    programs, money received from the rental of farm equipment to others,    and incidental receipts from the sale of wood, sand, gravel, etc.    Operating expenses include cost of feed, fertilizer, seed, and other    farming supplies, cash wages paid to farmhands, depreciation charges,    cash rent, interest on farm mortgages, farm building repairs, farm taxes    (not State and Federal personal income taxes), etc. The value of fuel,    food, or other farm products used for family living is not included as    part of net income.      Interest, Dividend, or Net Rental Income--Includes interest on savings    or bonds, dividends from stockholdings or membership in associations,    net income from rental of property to others and receipts from boarders    or lodgers, net royalties, and periodic payments from an estate or trust    fund.      Social Security Income--Includes Social Security pensions and survivors    benefits and permanent disability insurance payments made by the Social    Security Administration prior to deductions for medical insurance, and    railroad retirement insurance checks from the U.S. Government. Medicare    reimbursements are not included.      Public Assistance Income--Includes: (1) supplementary security income    payments made by Federal or State welfare agencies to low income persons    who are aged (65 years old or over), blind, or disabled; (2) aid to    families with dependent children, and (3) general assistance. Separate    payments received for hospital or other medical care (vendor payments)    are excluded from this item.      Retirement or Disability Income--Includes: (1) retirement pensions and    survivor benefits from a former employer, labor union, or Federal,    State, county, or other governmental agency; (2) disability income from    sources such as worker's compensation; companies or unions; Federal,    State, or local government; and the U.S. military; (3) periodic receipts    from annuities and insurance; and (4) regular income from IRA and KEOGH    plans.      All Other Income--Includes unemployment compensation, Veterans    Administration (VA) payments, alimony and child support,     contributions received periodically from persons not living in the    household, military family allotments, net gambling winnings, and other    kinds of periodic income other than earnings.   Income of Households--Includes the income of the householder and all other persons 15 years old and over in the household, whether related to the householder or not. Because many households consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than average family income.   Income of Families and Persons--In compiling statistics on family income, the incomes of all members 15 years old and over in each family are summed and treated as a single amount. However, for persons 15 years old and over, the total amounts of their own incomes are used. Although the income statistics covered the calendar year 1989, the characteristics of persons and the composition of families refer to the time of enumeration (April 1990).  Thus, the income of the family does not include amounts received by persons who were members of the family during all or part of the calendar year 1989 if these persons no longer resided with the family at the time of enumeration. Yet, family income amounts reported by related persons who did not reside with the family during 1989 but who were members of the family at the time of enumeration are included. However, the composition of most families was the same during 1989 as in April 1990.   Median Income--The median divides the income distribution into two equal parts, one having incomes above the median and the other having incomes below the median. For households and families, the median income is based on the distribution of the total number of units including those with no income. The median for persons is based on persons with income. The median income values for all households, families, and persons are computed on the basis of more detailed income intervals than shown in most tabulations. Median household or family income figures of $50,000 or less are calculated using linear interpolation. For persons, corresponding median values of $40,000 or less are also computed using linear interpolation. All other median income amounts are derived through Pareto interpolation. (For more information on medians and interpolation, see the discussion under ""Derived Measures."")   Mean Income--This is the amount obtained by dividing the total income of a particular statistical universe by the number of units in that universe. Thus, mean household income is obtained by dividing total household income by the total number of households. For the various types of income the means are based on households having those types of income. ""Per capita income"" is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group. It is derived by dividing the total income of a particular group by the total population in that group.   Care should be exercised in using and interpreting mean income values for small subgroups of the population. Because the mean is influenced strongly by extreme values in the distribution, it is especially susceptible to the effects of sampling variability, misreporting, and processing errors. The median, which is not affected by extreme values, is, therefore, a better measure than the mean when the population base is small. The mean, nevertheless, is shown in some data products for most small subgroups because, when weighted according to the number of cases, the means can be added to obtained summary measures for areas and groups other than those shown in census tabulations.   Limitation of the Data--Since questionnaire entries for income frequently are based on memory and not on records, many persons tended to forget minor or irregular sources of income and, therefore, underreport their income. Underreporting tends to be more pronounced for income sources that are not derived from earnings, such as Social Security, public assistance, or from interest, dividends, and net rental income.   There are errors of reporting due to the misunderstanding of the income questions such as reporting gross rather than net dollar amounts for the two questions on net self-employment income, which resulted in an overstatement of these items. Another common error is the reporting of identical dollar amounts in two of the eight type of income items where a respondent with only one source of income assumed that the second amount should be entered to represent total income. Such instances of overreporting had an impact on the level of mean nonfarm or farm self-employment income and mean total income published for the various geographical subdivisions of the State.   Extensive computer editing procedures were instituted in the data processing operation to reduce some of these reporting errors and to improve the accuracy of the income data. These procedures corrected various reporting deficiencies and improved the consistency of reported income items associated with work experience and information on occupation and class of worker. For example, if persons reported they were self-employed on their own farm, not incorporated, but had reported wage and salary earnings only, the latter amount was shifted to net farm self-employment income. Also, if any respondent reported total income only, the amount was generally assigned to one of the type of income items according to responses to the work experience and class-of-worker questions. Another type of problem involved nonreporting of income data. Where income information was not reported, procedures were devised to impute appropriate values with either no income or positive or negative dollar amounts for the missing entries. (For more information on imputation, see Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.)   In income tabulations for households and families, the lowest income group (e.g., less than $5,000) includes units that were classified as having no 1989 income. Many of these were living on income ""in kind,"" savings, or gifts, were newly created families, or families in which the sole breadwinner had recently died or left the household. However, many of the households and families who reported no income probably had some money income which was not recorded in the census.   The income data presented in the tabulations covers money income only. The fact that many farm families receive an important part of their income in the form of ""free"" housing and goods produced and consumed on the farm rather than in money should be taken into consideration in comparing the income of farm and nonfarm residents. Nonmoney income such as business expense accounts, use of business transportation and facilities, or partial compensation by business for medical and educational expenses was also received by some nonfarm residents. Many low income families also receive income ""in kind"" from public welfare programs. In comparing income data for 1989 with earlier years, it should be noted that an increase or decrease in money income does not necessarily represent a comparable change in real income, unless adjustments for changes in prices are made.   Comparability--The income data collected in the 1980 and 1970 censuses are  similar to the 1990 census data, but there are variations in the detail of the questions. In 1980, income information for 1979 was collected from persons in approximately 19 percent of all housing units and group quarters. Each person was required to report:        Wage or salary income      Net nonfarm self-employment income       Net farm self-employment income      Interest, dividend, or net rental or royalty income Social Security       income       Public assistance income      Income from all other sources   Between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, there were minor differences in the processing of the data. In both censuses, all persons with missing values in one or more of the detailed type of income items and total income were designated as allocated. Each missing entry was imputed either as a ""no"" or as a dollar amount. If total income was reported and one or more of the type of income fields was not answered, then the entry in total income generally was assigned to one of the income types according to the socioeconomic characteristics of the income recipient. This person was designated as unallocated.   In 1980 and 1990, all nonrespondents with income not reported (whether heads of households or other persons) were assigned the reported income of persons with similar characteristics. (For more information on imputation, see Appendix C, ""Accuracy of the Data."")   There was a difference in the method of computer derivation of aggregate income from individual amounts between the two census processing operations. In the 1980 census, income amounts less than $100,000 were coded in tens of dollars, and amounts of $100,000 or more were coded in thousands of dollars; $5 was added to each amount coded in tens of dollars and $500 to each amount coded in thousands of dollars. Entries of $999,000 or more were treated as $999,500 and losses of $9,999 or more were treated as minus $9,999. In the 1990 census, income amounts less than $999,999 were keyed in dollars. Amounts of $999,999 or more were treated as $999,999 and losses of $9,999 or more were treated as minus $9,999 in all of the computer derivations of aggregate income.   In 1970, information on income in 1969 was obtained from all members in every fifth housing unit and small group quarters (less than 15 persons) and every fifth person in all other group quarters. Each person was required to report:        Wage or salary income       Net nonfarm self-employment income       Net farm self-employment income       Social Security or Railroad Retirement       Public assistance or welfare payments       Income from all other sources  If a person reported a dollar amount in wage or salary, net nonfarm self-employment income, or net farm self-employment income, the person was considered as unallocated only if no further dollar amounts were imputed for any additional missing entries.  In 1960, data on income were obtained from all members in every fourth housing unit and from every fourth person 14 years old and over living in group quarters. Each person was required to report wage or salary income, net self-employment income, and income other than earnings received in 1959. An assumption was made in the editing process that no other type of income was received by a person who reported the receipt of either wage and salary income or self-employment but who had failed to report the receipt of other money income.   For several reasons, the income data shown in census tabulations are not directly comparable with those that may be obtained from statistical summaries of income tax returns. Income, as defined for Federal tax purposes, differs somewhat from the Census Bureau concept. Moreover, the coverage of income tax statistics is different because of the exemptions of persons having small amounts of income and the inclusion of net capital gains in tax returns. Furthermore, members of some families file separate returns and others file joint returns; consequently, the income reporting unit is not consistently either a family or a person.   The earnings data shown in census tabulations are not directly comparable with earnings records of the Social Security Administration. The earnings record data for 1989 excluded the earnings of most civilian government employees, some employees of nonprofit organizations, workers covered by the Railroad Retirement Act, and persons not covered by the program because of insufficient earnings. Furthermore, earnings received from any one employer in excess of $48,000 in 1989 are not covered by earnings records. Finally, because census data are obtained from household questionnaires, they may differ from Social Security Administration earnings record data, which are based upon employers' reports and the Federal income tax returns of self-employed persons.   The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce publishes annual data on aggregate and per-capita personal income received by the population for States, metropolitan areas, and selected counties. Aggregate income estimates based on the income statistics shown in census products usually would be less than those shown in the BEA income series for several reasons. The Census Bureau data are obtained directly from households, whereas the BEA income series is estimated largely on the basis of data from administrative records of business and governmental sources. Moreover, the definitions of income are different. The BEA income series includes some items not included in the income data shown in census publications, such as income ""in kind,"" income received by nonprofit institutions, the value of services of banks and other financial intermediaries rendered to persons without the assessment of specific charges, Medicare payments, and the income of persons who died or emigrated prior to April 1, 1990. On the other hand, the census income data include contributions for support received from persons not residing in the same household and employer contributions for social insurance.    INDUSTRY, OCCUPATION, AND CLASS OF WORKER --The data on industry, occupation, and class of worker were derived from answers to questionnaire items 28, 29, and 30 respectively. These questions were asked of a sample of persons. Information on industry relates to the kind of business conducted by a person's employing organization; occupation describes the kind of work the person does on the job.   For employed persons, the data refer to the person's job during the reference week. For those who worked at two or more jobs, the data refer to the job at which the person worked the greatest number of hours. For unemployed persons, the data refer to their last job. The industry and occupation statistics are derived from the detailed classification systems developed for the 1990 census as described below. The Classified Index of Industries and Occupations provided additional information on the industry and occupation classification systems.   Respondents provided the data for the tabulations by writing on the questionnaires descriptions of their industry and occupation. These descriptions were keyed and passed through automated coding software which assigned a portion of the written entries to categories in the classification system. The automated system assigned codes to 59 percent of the industry entries and 38 percent of the occupation entries.   Those cases not coded by the computer were referred to clerical staff in the Census Bureau's Kansas City processing office for coding. The clerical staff converted the written questionnaire descriptions to codes by comparing these descriptions to entries in the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations. For the industry code, these coders also referred to an Employer Name List (formerly called Company Name List). This list, prepared from the Standard Statistical Establishment List developed by the Census Bureau for the economic censuses and surveys, contained the names of business establishments and their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes converted to population census equivalents. This list facilitated coding and maintained industrial classification comparability.   Industry--The industry classification system developed for the 1990 census consists of 235 categories for employed persons, classified into 13 major industry groups. Since 1940, the industrial classification has been based on the Standard Industrial Classification Manual (SIC). The 1990 census classification was developed from the 1987 SIC published by the Office of Management and Budget Executive Office of the President.   The SIC was designed primarily to classify establishments by the type of industrial activity in which they were engaged. However, census data, which were collected from households, differ in detail and nature from those obtained from establishment surveys. Therefore, the census classification systems, while defined in SIC terms, cannot reflect the full detail in all categories. There are several levels of industrial classification found in census products. For example, the 1990 CP-2, Social and Economic Characteristics report includes 41 unique industrial categories, while the 1990 Summary Tape File 4 (STF 4) presents 72 categories.   Occupation--The occupational classification system developed for the 1990 census consists of 500 specific occupational categories for employed persons arranged into 6 summary and 13 major occupational groups. This classification was developed to be consistent with the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual: 1980, published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce. Tabulations with occupation as the primary characteristic present several levels of occupational detail. The most detailed tabulations are shown in a special 1990 subject report and tape files on occupation. These products contain all 500 occupational categories plus industry or class of worker subgroupings of occupational categories.   Some occupation groups are related closely to certain industries. Operators of transportation equipment, farm operators and workers, and private household workers account for major portions of their respective industries of transportation, agriculture, and private households. However, the industry categories include persons in other occupations. For example, persons employed in agriculture include truck drivers and bookkeepers; persons employed in the transportation industry include mechanics, freight handlers, and payroll clerks; and persons employed in the private household industry include occupations such as chauffeur, gardener, and secretary.   Class of Worker--The data on class of worker were derived from answers to questionnaire item 30. The information on class of worker refers to the same job as a respondent's industry and occupation and categorizes persons according to the type of ownership of the employing organization. The class of worker categories are defined as follows:      Private Wage and Salary Workers--Includes persons who worked for wages,    salary, commission, tips, pay-in-kind, or piece rates for a private for    profit employer or a private not-for-profit, tax-exempt or charitable    organization. Self-employed persons whose business was incorporated are    included with private wage and salary workers because they are paid    employees of their own companies. Some tabulations present data    separately for these subcategories: ""For profit,"" ""Not for profit,"" and    ""Own business incorporated.""      Employees of foreign governments, the United Nations, or other formal    international organizations were classified as ""Private-not-for-profit.""     Government Workers--Includes persons who were employees of any local,    State, or Federal governmental unit, regardless of the activity of the    particular agency. For some tabulations, the data were presented    separately for the three levels of government.      Self-Employed Workers--Includes persons who worked for profit or fees in    their own unincorporated business, profession, or trade, or who operated    a farm.      Unpaid Family Workers--Includes persons who worked 15 hours or more    without pay in a business or on a farm operated by a relative.      Salaried/Self-Employed--In tabulations that categorize persons as either    salaried or self-employed, the salaried category includes private and    government wage and salary workers; self-employed includes self-employed    persons and unpaid family workers.      The industry category, ""Public administration,"" is limited to regular    government functions such as legislative, judicial, administrative, and    regulatory activities of governments. Other government organizations    such as schools, hospitals, liquor stores, and bus lines are classified    by industry according to the activity in which they are engaged. On the    other hand, the class of worker government categories include all    government workers.   Occasionally respondents supplied industry, occupation, or class of worker descriptions which were not sufficiently specific for precise classification or did not report on these items at all. Some of these cases were corrected through the field editing process and during the coding and tabulation operations. In the coding operation, certain types of incomplete entries were corrected using the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations. For example, it was possible in certain situations to assign an industry code based on the occupation reported.   Following the coding operations, there was a computer edit and an allocation process. The edit first determined whether a respondent was in the universe which required an industry and occupation code. The codes for the three items (industry, occupation, and class of worker) were checked to ensure they were valid and were edited for their relation to each other. Invalid and inconsistent codes were either blanked or changed to a consistent code.   If one or more of the three codes were blank after the edit, a code was assigned from a ""similar"" person based on other items such as age, sex, education, farm or nonfarm residence, and weeks worked. If all the labor force and income data also were blank, all these economic items were assigned from one other person who provided all the necessary data.   Comparability--Comparability of industry and occupation data was affected by a number of factors, primarily the systems used to classify the questionnaire responses. For both the industry and occupation classification systems, the basic structures were generally the same from 1940 to 1970, but changes in the individual categories limited comparability of the data from one census to another. These changes were needed to recognize the ""birth"" of new industries and occupations, the ""death"" of others, and the growth and decline in existing industries and occupations, as well as, the desire of analysts and other users for more detail in the presentation of the data. Probably the greatest cause of incomparability is the movement of a segment of a category to a different category in the next census. Changes in the nature of jobs and respondent terminology, and refinement of category composition made these movements necessary.   In the 1990 census, the industry classification had minor revisions to reflect recent changes to the SIC. The 1990 occupational classification system is essentially the same as that for the 1980 census. However, the conversion of the census classification to the SOC in 1980 meant that the 1990 classification system was less comparable to the classifications used prior to the 1980 census.   Other factors that affected data comparability included the universe to which the data referred (in 1970, the age cutoff for labor force was changed from 14 years to 16 years); how the industry and occupation questions were worded on the questionnaire (for example, important changes were made in 1970); improvements in the coding procedures (the Employer Name List technique was introduced in 1960); and how the ""not reported"" cases are handled. Prior to 1970, they were placed in the residual categories, ""Industry not reported"" and ""Occupation not reported."" In 1970, an allocation process was introduced that assigned these cases to major groups. In 1990, as in 1980, the ""Not reported"" cases were assigned to individual categories. Therefore, the 1980 and 1990 data for individual categories included some numbers of persons who were tabulated in a ""Not reported"" category in previous censuses.   The following publications contain information on the various factors affecting comparability and are particularly useful for understanding differences in the occupation and industry information from earlier censuses: U.S. Bureau of the Census, Changes Between the 1950 and 1960 Occupation and Industry Classifications With Detailed Adjustments of 1950 Data to the 1960 Classifications, Technical Paper No. 18, 1968; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970 Occupation and Industry Classification Systems in Terms of their 1960 Occupation and Industry Elements, Technical Paper No. 26, 1972; and U.S. Bureau of the Census, The Relationship Between the 1970 and 1980 Industry and Occupation Classification Systems, Technical Paper No. 59, 1988. For citations for earlier census years, see the 1980 Census of Population report, PC80-1-D, Detailed Population Characteristics.   The 1990 census introduced an additional class of worker category for ""private not-for-profit"" employers. This category is a subset of the 1980 category ""employee of private employer"" so there is no comparable data before 1990. Also in 1990, employees of foreign governments, the United Nations, etc., are classified as ""private not-for-profit,"" rather than Federal Government as in 1970 and 1980. While in theory, there was a change in comparability, in practice, the small number of U.S. residents working for foreign governments made this change negligible.   Comparability between the statistics on industry and occupation from the 1990 census and statistics from other sources is affected by many of the factors described in the section on ""Employment Status."" These factors are primarily geographic differences between residence and place of work, different dates of reference, and differences in counts because of dual job holding. Industry data from population censuses cover all industries and all kinds of workers, whereas, data from establishments often excluded private household workers, government workers, and the self-employed. Also, the replies from household respondents may have differed in detail and nature from those obtained from establishments.   Occupation data from the census and data from government licensing agencies, professional associations, trade unions, etc., may not be as comparable as expected. Organizational listings often include persons not in the labor force or persons devoting all or most of their time to another occupation; or the same person may be included in two or more different listings. In addition, relatively few organizations, except for those requiring licensing, attained complete coverage of membership in a particular occupational field.    JOURNEY TO WORK    Place of Work--The data on place of work were derived from answers to questionnaire item 22, which was asked of persons who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week. (For more information, see discussion under ""Reference Week."")   Data were tabulated for workers 16 years and over; that is, members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. Data on place of work refer to the geographic location at which workers carried out their occupational activities during the reference week. The exact address (number and street) of the place of work was asked, as well as the place (city, town, or post office); whether or not the place of work was inside or outside the limits of that city or town; and the county, State, and ZIP Code. If the person's employer operated in more than one location, the exact address of the location or branch where the respondent worked was requested. When the number and street name were unknown, a description of the location, such as the building name or nearest street or intersection, was to be entered.   Persons who worked at more than one location during the reference week were asked to report the one at which they worked the greatest number of hours. Persons who regularly worked in several locations each day during the reference week were requested to give the address at which they began work each day. For cases in which daily work did not begin at a central place each day, the person was asked to provide as much information as possible to describe the area in which he or she worked most during the reference week.   In some tabulations, place-of-work locations may be defined as ""in area of residence"" and ""outside area of residence."" The area of residence may vary from table to table or even within a table, and refers to the particular area or areas shown. For example, in a table that provides data for counties, ""in area of residence"" refers to persons who worked in the same county in which they lived, while ""outside area of residence"" refers to persons whose workplace was located in a county different from the one in which they lived. Similarly, in a table that provides data for several types of areas, such as the State and its individual metropolitan areas (MA's), counties, and places, the place-of-work data will be variable and is determined by the geographic level (State, MA, county, or place) shown in each section of the tabulation.   In tabulations that present data for States, workplaces for the residents of the State may include, in addition to the State itself, each contiguous State. The category, ""in noncontiguous State or abroad,"" includes persons who worked in a State that did not border their State of residence as well as persons who worked outside the United States.   In tabulations that present data for an MSA/PMSA, place-of-work locations are specified to show the main destinations of workers living in the MSA/PMSA. (For more information on metropolitan areas (MA's), see Appendix A, Area Classifications.) All place-of-work locations are identified with respect to the boundaries of the MSA/PMSA as ""inside MSA/PMSA"" or ""outside MSA/PMSA."" Locations within the MSA/PMSA are further divided into each central city, and each county or county balance. Selected large incorporated places also may be specified as places of work.   Within New England MSA/PMSA's, the places of work presented generally are cities and towns. Locations outside the MSA/PMSA are specified if they are important commuting destinations for residents of the MSA/PMSA, and may include adjoining MSA/PMSA's and their central cities, their component counties, large incorporated places, or counties, cities, or other geographic areas outside any MA. In tabulations for MSA/PMSA's in New England; Honolulu, Hawaii; and certain other MA's, some place-of-work locations are identified as ""areas"" (e.g., Area 1, Area 5, Area 12, etc.). Such areas consist of groups of towns, cities, census designated places (Honolulu MSA only), or counties that have been identified as unique place-of-work destinations. When an adjoining MSA/PMSA or MSA/PMSA remainder is specified as a place-of-work location, its components are not defined. However, the components are presented in the 1990 CP-1, General Population Characteristics for Metropolitan Areas and the 1990 CH-1, General Housing Characteristics for Metropolitan Areas reports. In tabulations that present data for census tracts outside MA's, place-of-work locations are defined as ""in county of residence"" and ""outside county of residence.""   In areas where the workplace address was coded to the block level, persons were tabulated as working inside or outside a specific place based on the location of that address, regardless of the response to question 22c concerning city/town limits. In areas where it was impossible to code the workplace address to the block level, persons were tabulated as working in a place if a place name was reported in question 22b and the response to question 22c was either ""Yes"" or the item was left blank. In selected areas, census designated places (CDP's) may appear in the tabulations as places of work. The accuracy of place-of-work data for CDP's may be affected by the extent to which their census names were familiar to respondents, and by coding problems caused by similarities between the CDP name and the names of other geographic jurisdictions in the same vicinity.   Place-of-work data are given for selected minor civil divisions (generally, cities, towns, and townships) in the nine Northeastern States, based on the responses to the place-of-work question. Many towns and townships are regarded locally as equivalent to a place and therefore, were reported as the place of work. When a respondent reported a locality or incorporated place that formed a part of a township or town, the coding and tabulating procedure was designed to include the response in the total for the township or town. The accuracy of the place-of-work data for minor civil divisions is greatest for the New England States. However, the data for some New England towns, for towns in New York, and for townships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania may be affected by coding problems that resulted from the unfamiliarity of the respondent with the minor civil division in which the workplace was located or when a township and a city or borough of the same or similar name are located close together.   Place-of-work data may show a few workers who made unlikely daily work trips (e.g., workers who lived in New York and worked in California). This result is attributable to persons who worked during the reference week at a location that was different from their usual place of work, such as persons away from home on business.  Comparability--The wording of the question on place of work was substantially the same in the 1990 census as it was in 1980. However, data on place of work from the 1990 census are based on the full census sample, while data from the 1980 census were based on only about one-half of the full sample.  For the 1980 census, nonresponse or incomplete responses to the place-of-work question were not allocated, resulting in the use of ""not reported"" categories in the 1980 publications. However, for the 1990 census, when place of work was not reported or the response was incomplete, a work location was allocated to the person based on their means of transportation to work, travel time to work, industry, and location of residence and workplace of others. The 1990 publications, therefore, do not contain a ""not reported"" category for the place-of-work data.  Comparisons between 1980 and 1990 census data on the gross number of workers in particular commuting flows, or the total number of persons working in an area, should be made with extreme caution. Any apparent increase in the magnitude of the gross numbers may be due solely to the fact that for 1990 the ""not reported"" cases have been distributed among specific place-of-work destinations, instead of tallied in a separate category as in 1980.  Limitation of the Data--The data on place of work relate to a reference week; that is, the calendar week preceding the date on which the  respondents completed their questionnaires or were interviewed by enumerators. This week is not the same for all respondents because the enumeration was not completed in 1 week. However, for the majority of persons, the reference week for the 1990 census is the last week in March 1990. The lack of a uniform reference week means that the place-of-work data reported in the census will not exactly match the distribution of workplace locations observed or measured during an actual workweek.  The place-of-work data are estimates of persons 16 years old and over who were both employed and at work during the reference week (including persons in the Armed Forces). Persons who did not work during the reference week but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons are not included in the place-of-work data. Therefore, the data on place of work understate the total number of jobs or total employment in a geographic area during the reference week. It also should be noted that persons who had irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs during the reference week may have erroneously reported themselves as not working.   The address where the individual worked most often during the reference week was recorded on the census questionnaire. If a worker held two jobs, only data about the primary job (the one worked the greatest number of hours during the preceding week) was requested. Persons who regularly worked in several locations during the reference week were requested to give the address at which they began work each day. For cases in which daily work was not begun at a central place each day, the person was asked to provide as much information as possible to describe the area in which he or she worked most during the reference week.  Means of Transportation to Work--The data on means of transportation to work were derived from answers to questionnaire item 23a, which was asked of persons who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week. (For more information, see discussion under ""Reference Week."") Means of transportation to work refers to the principal mode of travel or type of conveyance that the person usually used to get from home to work during the reference week.   Persons who used different means of transportation on different days of the week were asked to specify the one they used most often, that is, the greatest number of days. Persons who used more than one means of transportation to get to work each day were asked to report the one used for the longest distance during the work trip. The category, ""Car, truck, or van,"" includes workers using a car (including company cars but excluding taxicabs), a truck of one-ton capacity or less, or a van. The category, ""Public transportation,"" includes workers who used a bus or trolley bus, streetcar or trolley car, subway or elevated, railroad, ferryboat, or taxicab even if each mode is not shown separately in the tabulation. The category, ""Other means,"" includes workers who used a mode of travel which is not identified separately within the data distribution. The category, ""Other means,"" may vary from table to table, depending on the amount of detail shown in a particular distribution.   The means of transportation data for some areas may show workers using modes of public transportation that are not available in those areas (e.g., subway or elevated riders in an MA where there actually is no subway or elevated service). This result is largely due to persons who worked during the reference week at a location that was different from their usual place of work (such as persons away from home on business in an area where subway service was available) and persons who used more than one means of transportation each day but whose principal means was unavailable where they lived (for example, residents of nonmetropolitan areas who drove to the fringe of an MA and took the commuter railroad most of the distance to work).   Private Vehicle Occupancy--The data on private vehicle occupancy were derived from answers to questionnaire item 23b. This question was asked of persons who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in question 23a that their means of transportation to work was ""Car, truck, or van."" (For more information, see discussion under ""Reference Week."")   Private vehicle occupancy refers to the number of persons who usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. The category, ""Drove alone,"" includes persons who usually drove alone to work as well as persons who were driven to work by someone who then drove back home or to a nonwork destination. The category, ""Carpooled,"" includes workers who reported that two or more persons usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week.   Persons Per Car, Truck, or Van--This is obtained by dividing the number of persons who reported using a car, truck, or van to get to work by the number of such vehicles that they used. The number of vehicles used is derived by counting each person who drove alone as one vehicle, each person who reported being in a two-person carpool as one-half vehicle, each person who reported being in a three-person carpool as one-third vehicle, and so on, and then summing all the vehicles.   Time Leaving Home to Go to Work--The data on time leaving home to go to work were derived from answers to questionnaire item 24a. This question was asked of persons who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in question 23a that they worked outside their home. The departure time refers to the time of day that the person usually left home to go to work during the reference week. (For more information, see discussion under ""Reference Week."")   Travel Time to Work--The data on travel time to work were derived from answers to questionnaire item 24b. This question was asked of persons who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in question 23a that they worked outside their home. Travel time to work refers to the total number of minutes that it usually took the person to get from home to work during the reference week. The elapsed time includes time spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. (For more information, see discussion under ""Reference Week."")    LANGUAGE SPOKEN AT HOME AND ABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH    Language Spoken at Home--Data on language spoken at home were derived from the answers to questionnaire items 15a and 15b, which were asked of a sample of persons born before April 1, 1985. Instructions mailed with the 1990 census questionnaire stated that a respondent should mark ""Yes"" in question 15a if the person sometimes or always spoke a language other than English at home and should not mark ""Yes"" if a language was spoken only at school or if speaking was limited to a few expressions or slang. For question 15b, respondents were instructed to print the name of the non-English language spoken at home. If the person spoke more than one language other than English, the person was to report the language spoken more often or the language learned first.  The cover of the census questionnaire included information in Spanish which provided a telephone number for respondents to call to request a census questionnaire and instructions in Spanish. Instruction guides were also available in 32 other languages to assist enumerators who encountered households or respondents who spoke no English.   Questions 15a and 15b referred to languages spoken at home in an effort to measure the current use of languages other than English. Persons who knew languages other than English but did not use them at home or who only used them elsewhere were excluded. Persons who reported speaking a language other than English at home may also speak English; however, the questions did not permit determination of the main or dominant language of persons who spoke both English and another language. (For more information, see discussion below on ""Ability to Speak English."")   For persons who indicated that they spoke a language other than English at home in question 15a, but failed to specify the name of the language in question 15b, the language was assigned based on the language of other speakers in the household; on the language of a person of the same Spanish origin or detailed race group living in the same or a nearby area; or on a person of the same ancestry or place of birth. In all cases where a person was assigned a non-English language, it was assumed that the language was spoken at home. Persons for whom the name of a language other than English was entered in question 15b, and for whom question 15a was blank were assumed to speak that language at home.   The write-in responses listed in question 15b (specific language spoken) were transcribed onto computer files and coded into more than 380 detailed language categories using an automated coding system. The automated procedure compared write-in responses reported by respondents with entries in a computer dictionary, which initially contained approximately 2,000 language names. The dictionary was updated with a large number of new names, variations in spelling, and a small number of residual categories. Each write-in response was given a numeric code that was associated with one of the detailed categories in the dictionary. If the respondent listed more than one non-English language, only the first was coded.   The write-in responses represented the names people used for languages they speak. They may not match the names or categories used by linguists. The sets of categories used are sometimes geographic and sometimes linguistic. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the content of the classification schemes used to present language data. For more information, write to the Chief, Population Division, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.  Household Language--In households where one or more persons (age 5 years old or over) speak a language other than English, the household language assigned to all household members is the non-English language spoken by the first person with a non-English language in the following order:       householder, spouse, parent, sibling,      child, grandchild, other relative, stepchild, unmarried partner,      housemate or roommate, roomer, boarder, or foster child, or other       nonrelative. Thus, persons who speak only English may have a       non-English household language assigned to them in tabulations of       persons by household language.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Figure 1.

The data on ability to speak English represent the person's own perception about his or her own ability or, because census questionnaires are usually completed by one household member, the responses may represent the perception of another household member. The instruction guides and questionnaires that were mailed to households did not include any information on how to interpret the response categories in question 15c.   Persons who reported that they spoke a language other than English at home but whose ability to speak English was not reported, were assigned the English-language ability of a randomly selected person of the same age, Spanish origin, nativity and year of entry, and language group.   Linguistic Isolation-- A household in which no person age 14 years or over speaks only English and no person age 14 years or over who speaks a language other than English speaks English ""Very well"" is classified as ""linguistically isolated."" All the members of a linguistically isolated household are tabulated as linguistically isolated, including members under age 14 years who may speak only English.    Limitation of the Data--Persons who speak a language other than English at home may have first learned that language at school. However, these persons would be expected to indicate that they spoke English ""Very well."" Persons who speak a language other than English, but do not do so at home, should have been reported as not speaking a language other than English at home.   The extreme detail in which language names were coded may give a false impression of the linguistic precision of these data. The names used by speakers of a language to identify it may reflect ethnic, geographic, or political affiliations and do not necessarily respect linguistic distinctions. The categories shown in the tabulations were chosen on a number of criteria, such as information about the number of speakers of each language that might be expected in a sample of the United States population.   Comparability--Information on language has been collected in every census since 1890.  The comparability of data among censuses is limited by changes in question wording, by the subpopulations to whom the question was addressed, and by the detail that was published.    The same question on language was asked in the 1980 and 1990 censuses. This question on the current language spoken at home replaced the questions asked in prior censuses on mother tongue; that is, the language other than English spoken in the person's home when he or she was a child; one's first language; or the language spoken before immigrating to the United States. The censuses of 1910-1940, 1960 and 1970 included questions on mother tongue. A change in coding procedure from 1980 to 1990 should have improved accuracy of coding and may affect the number of persons reported in some of the 380 plus categories. It should not greatly affect the 4-group or 25- group lists. In 1980, coding clerks supplied numeric codes for the written entries on each questionnaire using a 2,000 name reference list. In 1990 written entries were transcribed to a computer file and matched to a computer dictionary which began with the 2,000 name list, but expanded as unmatched names were referred to headquarters specialists for resolution.   The question on ability to speak English was asked for the first time in 1980. In tabulations from 1980, the categories ""Very well"" and ""Well"" were combined. Data from other surveys suggested a major difference between the category ""Very well"" and the remaining categories. In tabulations showing ability to speak English, persons who reported that they spoke English ""Very well"" are presented separately from persons who reported their ability to speak English as less than ""Very well.""    MARITAL STATUS --The data on marital status were derived from answers to questionnaire item 6, which was asked of all persons. The marital status classification refers to the status at the time of enumeration. Data on marital status are tabulated only for persons 15 years old and over.   All persons were asked whether they were ""now married,"" ""widowed,"" ""divorced,"" ""separated,"" or ""never married."" Couples who live together (unmarried persons, persons in common-law marriages) were allowed to report the marital status they considered the most appropriate.   Never Married--Includes all persons who have never been married, including persons whose only marriage(s) was annulled.   Ever Married--Includes persons married at the time of enumeration (including those separated), widowed, or divorced.   Now Married, Except Separated--Includes persons whose current marriage has not ended through widowhood, divorce, or separation (regardless of previous marital history). The category may also include couples who live together or persons in common-law marriages if they consider this category the most appropriate. In certain tabulations, currently married persons are further classified as ""spouse present"" or ""spouse absent.""   Separated--Includes persons legally separated or otherwise absent from their spouse because of marital discord. Included are persons who have been deserted or who have parted because they no longer want to live together but who have not obtained a divorce.   Widowed--Includes widows and widowers who have not remarried.   Divorced--Includes persons who are legally divorced and who have not  remarried.   In selected sample tabulations, data for married and separated persons are reorganized and combined with information on the presence of the spouse in the same household.   Now Married--All persons whose current marriage has not ended by widowhood  or divorce. This category includes persons defined above as ""separated.""   Spouse Present--Married persons whose wife or husband was enumerated as a member of the same household, including those whose spouse may have been temporarily absent for such reasons as travel or hospitalization.   Spouse Absent--Married persons whose wife or husband was not enumerated as a member of the same household. This category also includes all married persons living in group quarters.    Separated--Defined above.   Spouse Absent, Other--Married persons whose wife or husband was not enumerated as a member of the same household, excluding separated. Included is any person whose spouse was employed and living away from home or in an institution or absent in the Armed Forces.   Differences between the number of currently married males and the number of currently married females occur because of reporting differences and because some husbands and wives have their usual residence in different areas. In sample tabulations, these differences can also occur because different weights are applied to the individual's data. Any differences between the number of ""now married, spouse present"" males and females are due solely to sample weighting. By definition, the numbers would be the same.   When marital status was not reported, it was imputed according to the relationship to the householder and sex and age of the person. (For more information on imputation, see Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.)   Comparability--The 1990 marital status definitions are the same as those  used in 1980 with the exception of the term ""never married"" which replaces the term ""single"" in tabulations. A general marital status question has been asked in every census since 1880.    MOBILITY LIMITATION STATUS --The data on mobility limitation status were derived from answers to questionnaire item 19a, which was asked of a sample of persons 15 years old and over. Persons were identified as having a mobility limitation if they had a health condition that had lasted for 6 or more months and which made it difficult to go outside the home alone. Examples of outside activities on the questionnaire included shopping and visiting the doctor's office.   The term ""health condition"" referred to both physical and mental conditions. A temporary health problem, such as a broken bone that was expected to heal normally, was not considered a health condition.   Comparability--This was the first time that a question on mobility limitation was included in the census.    PLACE OF BIRTH --The data on place of birth were derived from answers to questionnaire item 8, which was asked on a sample basis. The place-of-birth question asked respondents to report the U.S. State, commonwealth or territory, or the foreign country where they were born. Persons born outside the United States were asked to report their place of birth according to current international boundaries. Since numerous changes in boundaries of foreign countries have occurred in the last century, some persons may have reported their place of birth in terms of boundaries that existed at the time of their birth or emigration, or in accordance with their own national preference.   Persons not reporting place of birth were assigned the birthplace of another family member or were allocated the response of another person with similar characteristics. Persons allocated as foreign born were not assigned a specific country of birth but were classified as ""Born abroad, country not specified.""   Nativity--Information on place of birth and citizenship were used to  classify the population into two major categories: native and foreign born. When information on place of birth was not reported, nativity was assigned on the basis of answers to citizenship, if reported, and other characteristics.   Native--Includes persons born in the United States, Puerto Rico, or an outlying area of the United States. The small number of persons who were born in a foreign country but have at least one American parent also are included in this category.   The native population is classified in the following groups: persons born in the State in which they resided at the time of the census; persons born in a different State, by region; persons born in Puerto Rico or an outlying area of the U.S.; and persons born abroad with at least one American parent.   Foreign Born--Includes persons not classified as ""Native."" Prior to the 1970 census, persons not reporting place of birth were generally classified as native.   The foreign-born population is shown by selected area, country, or region of birth: the places of birth shown in data products were selected based on the number of respondents who reported that area or country of birth.   Comparability--Data on the State of birth of the native population have been collected in each census beginning with that of 1850. Similar data were shown in tabulations for the 1980 census and other recent censuses. Nonresponse was allocated in a similar manner in 1980; however, prior to 1980, nonresponse to the place of birth question was not allocated. Prior to the 1970 census, persons not reporting place of birth were generally classified as native.   The questionnaire instruction to report mother's State of residence instead of the person's actual State of birth (if born in a hospital in a different State) was dropped in 1990. Evaluation studies of 1970 and 1980 census data demonstrated that this instruction was generally either ignored or misunderstood. Since the hospital and the mother's residence is in the same State for most births, this change may have a slight effect on State of birth data for States with large metropolitan areas that straddle State lines.    POVERTY STATUS IN 1989 --The data on poverty status were derived from answers to the same questions as the income data, questionnaire items 32 and 33. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Income in 1989."") Poverty statistics presented in census publications were based on a definition originated by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently modified by Federal interagency committees in 1969 and 1980 and prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget in Directive 14 as the standard to be used by Federal agencies for statistical purposes.   At the core of this definition was the 1961 economy food plan, the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture. It was determined from the Agriculture Department's 1955 survey of food consumption that families of three or more persons spend approximately one-third of their income on food; hence, the poverty level for these families was set at three times the cost of the economy food plan. For smaller families and persons living alone, the cost of the economy food plan was multiplied by factors that were slightly higher to compensate for the relatively larger fixed expenses for these smaller households.   The income cutoffs used by the Census Bureau to determine the poverty status of families and unrelated individuals included a set of 48 thresholds arranged in a two-dimensional matrix consisting of family size (from one person to nine or more persons) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to eight or more children present). Unrelated individuals and two-person families were further differentiated by age of the householder (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over).   The total income of each family or unrelated individual in the sample was tested against the appropriate poverty threshold to determine the poverty status of that family or unrelated individual. If the total income was less than the corresponding cutoff, the family or unrelated individual was classified as ""below the poverty level."" The number of persons below the poverty level was the sum of the number of persons in families with incomes below the poverty level and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes below the poverty level.   The poverty thresholds are revised annually to allow for changes in the cost of living as reflected in the Consumer Price Index. The average poverty threshold for a family of four persons was $12,674 in 1989. (For more information, see table A below.) Poverty thresholds were applied on a national basis and were not adjusted for regional, State or local variations in the cost of living. For a detailed discussion of the poverty definition, see U.S. Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, Series P-60, No. 171, Poverty in the United States: 1988 and 1989.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Table A.

These groups also were excluded from the denominator when calculating poverty rates.   Specified Poverty Levels--Since the poverty levels currently in use by the Federal Government do not meet all the needs of data users, some of the data are presented for alternate levels. These specified poverty levels are obtained by multiplying the income cutoffs at the poverty level by the appropriate factor. For example, the average income cutoff at 125 percent of poverty level was $15,843 ($12,674 x 1.25) in 1989 for a family of four persons.   Weighted Average Thresholds at the Poverty Level--The average thresholds shown in the first column of table A are weighted by the presence and number of children. For example, the weighted average threshold for a given family size is obtained by multiplying the threshold for each presence and number of children category within the given family size by the number of families in that category. These products are then aggregated across the entire range of presence and number of children categories, and the aggregate is divided by the total number of families in the group to yield the weighted average threshold at the poverty level for that family size.   Since the basic thresholds used to determine the poverty status of families and unrelated individuals are applied to all families and unrelated individuals, the weighted average poverty thresholds are derived using all families and unrelated individuals rather than just those classified as being below the poverty level. To obtain the weighted poverty thresholds for families and unrelated individuals below alternate poverty levels, the weighted thresholds shown in table A may be multiplied directly by the appropriate factor. The weighted average thresholds presented in the table are based on the March 1990 Current Population Survey. However, these thresholds would not differ significantly from those based on the 1990 census.   Income Deficit--Represents the difference between the total income of families and unrelated individuals below the poverty level and their respective poverty thresholds. In computing the income deficit, families reporting a net income loss are assigned zero dollars and for such cases the deficit is equal to the poverty threshold.   This measure provided an estimate of the amount which would be required to raise the incomes of all poor families and unrelated individuals to their respective poverty thresholds. The income deficit is thus a measure of the degree of impoverishment of a family or unrelated individual. However, caution must be used in comparing the average deficits of families with different characteristics. Apparent differences in average income deficits may, to some extent, be a function of differences in family size.   Mean Income Deficit--Represents the amount obtained by dividing the total income deficit of a group below the poverty level by the number of families (or unrelated individuals) in that group.   Comparability--The poverty definition used in the 1990 and 1980 censuses  differed slightly from the one used in the 1970 census. Three technical modifications were made to the definition used in the 1970 census as described below:   1. The separate thresholds for families with a female householder with    no husband present and all other families were eliminated. For the 1980    and 1990 censuses, the weighted average of the poverty thresholds for    these two types of families was applied to all types of families,    regardless of the sex of the householder.  2. Farm families and farm unrelated individuals no longer had a set of    poverty thresholds that were lower than the thresholds applied to    nonfarm families and unrelated individuals. The farm thresholds were 85    percent of the corresponding levels for nonfarm families in the 1970    census. The same thresholds were applied to all families and unrelated    individuals regardless of residence in 1980 and 1990.   3. The thresholds by size of family were extended from seven or more    persons in 1970 to nine or more persons in 1980 and 1990.   These changes resulted in a minimal increase in the number of poor at the national level. For a complete discussion of these modifications and their impact, see the Current Population Reports, Series P-60, No. 133.   The population covered in the poverty statistics derived from the 1980 and 1990 censuses was essentially the same as in the 1970 census. The only difference was that in 1980 and 1990, unrelated individuals under 15 years old were excluded from the poverty universe, while in 1970, only those under 14 years old were excluded. The poverty data from the 1960 census excluded all persons in group quarters and included all unrelated individuals regardless of age. It was unlikely that these differences in population coverage would have had significant impact when comparing the poverty data for persons since the 1960 censuses.   Current Population Survey--Because of differences in the questionnaires and data collection procedures, estimates of the number of persons below the poverty level by various characteristics from the 1990 census may differ from those reported in the March 1990 Current Population Survey.    RACE --The data on race were derived from answers to questionnaire item 4, which was asked of all persons. The concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects self-identification; it does not denote any clear-cut scientific definition of biological stock. The data for race represent self-classification by people according to the race with which they most closely identify. Furthermore, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include both racial and national origin or socio-cultural groups.   During direct interviews conducted by enumerators, if a person could not provide a single response to the race question, he or she was asked to select, based on self-identification, the group which best described his or her racial identity. If a person could not provide a single race response, the race of the mother was used. If a single race response could not be provided for the person's mother, the first race reported by the person was used. In all cases where occupied housing units, households, or families are classified by race, the race of the householder was used.   The racial classification used by the Census Bureau generally adheres to the guidelines in Federal Statistical Directive No. 15, issued by the Office of Management and Budget, which provides standards on ethnic and racial categories for statistical reporting to be used by all Federal agencies. The racial categories used in the 1990 census data products are provided below.   White--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""White"" or reported entries such as Canadian, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.   Black--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Black or Negro"" or reported entries such as African American, Afro-American, Black Puerto Rican, Jamaican, Nigerian, West Indian, or Haitian.   American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut--Includes persons who classified themselves as such in one of the specific race categories identified below.  American Indian--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""American Indian,"" entered the name of an Indian tribe, or reported such entries as Canadian Indian, French-American Indian, or Spanish-American Indian.   American Indian Tribe--Persons who identified themselves as American Indian were asked to report their enrolled or principal tribe. Therefore, tribal data in tabulations reflect the written tribal entries reported on the questionnaires. Some of the entries (for example, Iroquois, Sioux, Colorado River, and Flathead) represent nations or reservations.   The information on tribe is based on self-identification and therefore does not reflect any designation of Federally- or State-recognized tribe. Information on American Indian tribes is presented in summary tape files and special data products. The information is derived from the American Indian Detailed Tribal Classification List for the 1990 census. The classification list represents all tribes, bands, and clans that had a specified number of American Indians reported on the census questionnaire.   Eskimo--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Eskimo"" or reported entries such as Arctic Slope, Inupiat, and Yupik.   Aleut--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Aleut"" or reported entries such as Alutiiq, Egegik, and Pribilovian.   Asian or Pacific Islander--Includes persons who reported in one of the Asian or Pacific Islander groups listed on the questionnaire or who provided write-in responses such as Thai, Nepali, or Tongan. A more detailed listing of the groups comprising the Asian or Pacific Islander population is presented in figure 2 below. In some data products, information is presented separately for the Asian population and the Pacific Islander population.   Asian--Includes ""Chinese,"" ""Filipino,"" ""Japanese,"" ""Asian Indian,"" ""Korean,"" ""Vietnamese,"" and ""Other Asian."" In some tables, ""Other Asian"" may not be shown separately, but is included in the total Asian population.  Chinese--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Chinese"" or who identified themselves as Cantonese, Tibetan, or Chinese American. In standard census reports, persons who reported as ""Taiwanese"" or ""Formosan"" are included here with Chinese.  In special reports on the Asian or Pacific Islander population, information on persons who identified themselves as Taiwanese are shown separately.   Filipino--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Filipino"" or reported entries such as Philipino, Philipine, or Filipino American.   Japanese--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Japanese"" and persons who identified themselves as Nipponese or Japanese American.   Asian Indian--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Asian Indian"" and persons who identified themselves as Bengalese, Bharat, Dravidian, East Indian, or Goanese.   Korean--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Korean"" and persons who identified themselves as Korean American.   Vietnamese--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Vietnamese"" and persons who identified themselves as Vietnamese American.   Cambodian--Includes persons who provided a write-in response such as Cambodian or Cambodia.   Hmong--Includes persons who provided a write-in response such as Hmong, Laohmong, or Mong.   Laotian--Includes persons who provided a write-in response such as Laotian, Laos, or Lao.   Thai--Includes persons who provided a write-in response such as Thai, Thailand, or Siamese.   Other Asian--Includes persons who provided a write-in response of Bangladeshi, Burmese, Indonesian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Amerasian, or Eurasian. See figure 2 for other groups comprising ""Other Asian.""   Pacific Islander--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Pacific  Islander"" by classifying themselves into one of the following groups or identifying themselves as one of the Pacific Islander cultural groups of Polynesian, Micronesian, or Melanesian.   Hawaiian--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Hawaiian"" as well as persons who identified themselves as Part Hawaiian or Native Hawaiian.   Samoan--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Samoan"" or persons who identified themselves as American Samoan or Western Samoan.   Guamanian--Includes persons who indicated their race as ""Guamanian"" or persons who identified themselves as Chamorro or Guam.   Other Pacific Islander--Includes persons who provided a write-in response of a Pacific Islander group such as Tahitian, Northern Mariana Islander, Palauan, Fijian, or a cultural group such as Polynesian, Micronesian, or Melanesian. See figure 2 for other groups comprising ""Other Pacific Islander.""   Other Race--Includes all other persons not included in the ""White,"" ""Black,"" ""American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut,"" and the ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" race categories described above. Persons reporting in the ""Other race"" category and providing write-in entries such as multiracial, multiethnic, mixed, interracial, Wesort, or a Spanish/Hispanic origin group (such as Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican) are included here.   Written entries to three categories on the race item--""Indian (Amer.),"" ""Other Asian or Pacific Islander (API),"" and ""Other race""--were reviewed, edited, and coded by subject matter specialists. (For more information on the coding operation, see the section below that discusses ""Comparability."")   The written entries under ""Indian (Amer.)"" and ""Other Asian or Pacific Islander (API)"" were reviewed and coded during 100-percent processing of the 1990 census questionnaires. A substantial portion of the entries for the ""Other race"" category also were reviewed, edited, and coded during the 100-percent processing. The remaining entries under ""Other race"" underwent review and coding during sample processing. Most of the written entries reviewed and coded during sample processing were those indicating Hispanic origin such as Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican.   If the race entry for a member of a household was missing on the questionnaire, race was assigned based upon the reported entries of race by other household members using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for the daughter of the householder, then the race of her mother (as female householder or female spouse) would be assigned. If there was no female householder or spouse in the household, the daughter would be assigned her father's (male householder) race. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, the race of a householder in a previously processed household was assigned. This procedure is a variation of the general imputation procedures described in Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.   Limitation of the Data--In the 1980 census, a relatively high proportion (20 percent) of American Indians did not report any tribal entry in the race item.  Evaluation of the pre-census tests indicated that changes made for the 1990 race item should improve the reporting of tribes in the rural areas (especially on reservations) for the 1990 census. The results for urban areas were inconclusive. Also, the precensus tests indicated that there may be overreporting of the Cherokee tribe. An evaluation of 1980 census data showed overreporting of Cherokee in urban areas or areas where the number of American Indians was sparse.   In the 1990 census, respondents sometimes did not fill in a circle or filled the ""Other race"" circle and wrote in a response, such as Arab, Polish, or African American in the shared write-in box for ""Other race"" and ""Other API"" responses. During the automated coding process, these responses were edited and assigned to the appropriate racial designation. Also, some Hispanic origin persons did not fill in a circle, but provided entries such as Mexican or Puerto Rican. These persons were classified in the ""Other race"" category during the coding and editing process. There may be some minor differences between sample data and 100- percent data because sample processing included additional edits not included in the 100-percent processing.   Figure 2.

Groups not shown are tabulated as ""All other Asian"" or ""All other Pacific Islander,"" respectively.   (2)Includes entries such as Asian American, Asian, Asiatic, Amerasian, and Eurasian.   (3)Polynesian, Micronesian, and Melanesian are Pacific Islander cultural groups.  Comparability--Differences between the 1990 census and earlier censuses affect the comparability of data for certain racial groups and American Indian tribes. The 1990 census was the first census to undertake, on a 100- percent basis, an automated review, edit, and coding operation for written responses to the race item. The automated coding system used in the 1990 census greatly reduced the potential for error associated with a clerical review. Specialists with a thorough knowledge of the race subject matter reviewed, edited, coded, and resolved inconsistent or incomplete responses. In the 1980 census, there was only a limited clerical review of the race responses on the 100-percent forms with a full clerical review conducted only on the sample questionnaires.   Another major difference between the 1990 and preceding censuses is the handling of the write-in responses for the Asian or Pacific Islander populations. In addition to the nine Asian or Pacific Islander categories shown on the questionnaire under the spanner ""Asian or Pacific Islander (API),"" the 1990 census race item provided a new residual category, ""Other API,"" for Asian or Pacific Islander persons who did not report in one of the listed Asian or Pacific Islander groups. During the coding operation, write-in responses for ""Other API"" were reviewed, coded, and assigned to the appropriate classification. For example, in 1990, a write-in entry of Laotian, Thai, or Javanese is classified as ""Other Asian,"" while a write-in entry of Tongan or Fijian is classified as ""Other Pacific Islander."" In the 1990 census, these persons were able to identify as ""Other API"" in both the 100-percent and sample operations.  In the 1980 census, the nine Asian or Pacific Islander groups were also listed separately. However, persons not belonging to these nine groups wrote in their specific racial group under the ""Other"" race category. Persons with a written entry such as Laotian, Thai, or Tongan, were tabulated and published as ""Other race"" in the 100- percent processing operation in 1980, but were reclassified as ""Other Asian and Pacific Islander"" in 1980 sample tabulations. In 1980 special reports on the Asian or Pacific Islander populations, data were shown separately for ""Other Asian"" and ""Other Pacific Islander.""   The 1970 questionnaire did not have separate race categories for Asian Indian, Vietnamese, Samoan, and Guamanian. These persons indicated their race in the ""Other"" category and later, through the editing process, were assigned to a specific group. For example, in 1970, Asian Indians were reclassified as ""White,"" while Vietnamese, Guamanians, and Samoans were included in the ""Other"" category.   Another difference between 1990 and preceding censuses is the approach taken when persons of Spanish/Hispanic origin did not report in a specific race category but reported as ""Other race"" or ""Other."" These persons commonly provided a write-in entry such as Mexican, Venezuelan, or Latino. In the 1990 and 1980 censuses, these entries remained in the ""Other race"" or ""Other"" category, respectively. In the 1970 census, most of these persons were included in the ""White"" category.   REFERENCE WEEK    The data on labor force status and journey to work were related to the reference week; that is, the calendar week preceding the date on which the respondents completed their questionnaires or were interviewed by enumerators. This week is not the same for all respondents since the enumeration was not completed in one week. The occurrence of holidays during the enumeration period could affect the data on actual hours worked during the reference week, but probably had no effect on overall measurement of employment status (see the discussion below on ""Comparability"").   Comparability--The reference weeks for the 1990 and 1980 censuses differ in  that Passover and Good Friday occurred in the first week of April 1980, but in the second week of April 1990. Many workers presumably took time off for those observances. The differing occurrence of these holidays could affect the comparability of the 1990 and 1980 data on actual hours worked for some areas if the respective weeks were the reference weeks for a significant number of persons. The holidays probably did not affect the overall measurement of employment status since this information was based on work activity during the entire reference week.    RESIDENCE IN 1985    The data on residence in 1985 were derived from answers to question 14b, which asked for the State (or foreign country), county, and place of residence on April 1, 1985, for those persons reporting in question 14a that on that date they lived in a different house than their current residence. Residence in 1985 is used in conjunction with location of current residence to determine the extent of residential mobility of the population and the resulting redistribution of the population across the various States, metropolitan areas, and regions of the country.   When no information on residence in 1985 was reported for a person, information for other family members, if available, was used to assign a location of residence in 1985. All cases of nonresponse or incomplete response that were not assigned a previous residence based on information from other family members were allocated the previous residence of another person with similar characteristics who provided complete information.   The tabulation category, ""Same house,"" includes all persons 5 years old and over who did not move during the 5 years as well as those who had moved but by 1990 had returned to their 1985 residence. The category, ""Different house in the United States,"" includes persons who lived in the United States in 1985 but in a different house or apartment from the one they occupied on April 1, 1990. These movers are then further subdivided according to the type of move.   In most tabulations, movers are divided into three groups according to their 1985 residence: ""Different house, same county,"" ""Different county, same State,"" and ""Different State."" The last group may be further subdivided into region of residence in 1985.  The category, ""Abroad,"" includes those persons who were residing in a foreign country, Puerto Rico, or an outlying area of the U.S. in 1985, including members of the Armed Forces and their dependents. Some tabulations show movers who were residing in Puerto Rico or an outlying area in 1985 separately from those residing in other countries.   In tabulations for metropolitan areas, movers are categorized according to the metropolitan status of their current and previous residences, resulting in such groups as movers within an MSA/PMSA, movers between PMSA's, movers from nonmetropolitan areas to MSA/PMSA, and movers from central cities to the remainder of an MSA/PMSA. In some tabulations, these categories are further subdivided by size of MSA/PMSA, region of current or previous residence, or movers within or between central cities and the remainder of the same or a different MSA/PMSA.   The size categories used in some tabulations for both 1985 and 1990 residence refer to the populations of the MSA/PMSA on April 1, 1990; that is, at the end of the migration interval.   Some tabulations present data on inmigrants, outmigrants, and net migration. ""Inmigrants"" are generally defined as those persons who entered a specified area by crossing its boundary from some point outside the area. In some tabulations, movers from abroad are included in the number of inmigrants; in others, only movers within the United States are included.   ""Outmigrants"" are persons who depart from a specific area by crossing its boundary to a point outside it, but without leaving the United States. ""Net migration"" is calculated by subtracting the number of outmigrants from the number of inmigrants and, depending upon the particular tabulation, may or may not include movers from abroad. The net migration for the area is net inmigration if the result was positive and net outmigration if the result was negative. In the tabulations, net outmigration is indicated by a minus sign (-).   Inmigrants and outmigrants for States include only those persons who did not live in the same State in 1985 and 1990; that is, they exclude persons who moved between counties within the same State. Thus, the sum of the inmigrants to (or outmigrants from) all counties in any State is greater than the number of inmigrants to (or outmigrants from) that State. However, in the case of net migration, the sum of the nets for all the counties within a State equal the net for the State. In the same fashion, the net migration for a division or region equals the sum of the nets for the States comprising that division or region, while the number of inmigrants and outmigrants for that division or region is less than the sum of the inmigrants or outmigrants for the individual States.   The number of persons who were living in a different house in 1985 is somewhat less than the total number of moves during the 5-year period. Some persons in the same house at the two dates had moved during the 5-year period but by the time of the census had returned to their 1985 residence. Other persons who were living in a different house had made one or more intermediate moves. For similar reasons, the number of persons living in a different county, MSA/PMSA, or State or moving between nonmetropolitan areas may be understated.   Comparability--Similar questions were asked on all previous censuses beginning in 1940, except the questions in 1950 referred to residence 1 year earlier rather than 5 years earlier. Although the questions in the 1940 census covered a 5-year period, comparability with that census was reduced somewhat because of different definitions and categories of tabulation.  Comparability with the 1960 and 1970 census is also somewhat reduced because nonresponse was not allocated in those earlier censuses. For the 1980 census, nonresponse was allocated in a manner similar to the 1990 allocation scheme.    SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND LABOR FORCE STATUS   Tabulation of data on enrollment, educational attainment, and labor force status for the population 16 to 19 years old allows for calculation of the proportion of the age group who are not enrolled in school and not high school graduates or ""dropouts"" and an unemployment rate for the ""dropout"" population. Definitions of the three topics and descriptions of the census items from which they were derived are presented in ""Educational Attainment,"" ""Employment Status,"" and ""School Enrollment and Type of School."" The published tabulations include both the civilian and Armed Forces populations, but labor force status is provided for the civilian population only. Therefore, the component labor force statuses may not add to the total lines enrolled in school, high school graduate, and not high school graduate. The difference is Armed Forces.  Comparability--The tabulation of school enrollment by labor force status is similar to that published in 1980 census reports. The 1980 census tabulation included a single data line for Armed Forces; however, enrollment, attainment, and labor force status data were shown for the civilian population only. In 1970, a tabulation was included for 16 to 21 year old males not attending school.    SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND TYPE OF SCHOOL    Data on school enrollment were derived from answers to questionnaire item 11, which was asked of a sample of persons. Persons were classified as enrolled in school if they reported attending a ""regular"" public or private school or college at any time between February 1, 1990, and the time of enumeration. The question included instructions to ""include only nursery school, kindergarten, elementary school, and schooling which would lead to a high school diploma or a college degree"" as regular school. Instructions included in the 1990 respondent instruction guide, which was mailed with the census questionnaire, further specified that enrollment in a trade or business school, company training, or tutoring were not to be included unless the course would be accepted for credit at a regular elementary school, high school, or college. Persons who did not answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status and type of school of a person with the same age, race or Hispanic origin, and, at older ages, sex, whose residence was in the same or a nearby area.   Public and Private School--Includes persons who attended school in the reference period and indicated they were enrolled by marking one of the questionnaire categories for either ""public school, public college"" or ""private school, private college."" The instruction guide defines a public school as ""any school or college controlled and supported by a local, county, State, or Federal Government."" ""Schools supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or other private groups"" are defined as private. Persons who filled both the ""public"" and ""private"" circles are edited to the first entry, ""public.""   Level of School in Which Enrolled--Persons who were enrolled in school were classified as enrolled in ""preprimary school,"" ""elementary or high school,"" or ""college"" according to their response to question 12 (years of school completed or highest degree received). Persons who were enrolled and reported completing nursery school or less were classified as enrolled in ""preprimary school,"" which includes kindergarten.  Similarly, enrolled persons who had completed at least kindergarten, but not high school, were classified as enrolled in elementary or high school. Enrolled persons who reported completing high school or some college or having received a post- secondary degree were classified as enrolled in ""college."" Enrolled persons who reported completing the twelfth grade but receiving ""NO DIPLOMA"" were classified as enrolled in high school. (For more information on level of school, see the discussion under ""Educational Attainment."")   Comparability--School enrollment questions have been included in the census since 1840; grade attended was first asked in 1940; type of school was first asked in 1960. Before 1940, the enrollment question in various censuses referred to attendance in the preceding six months or the preceding year. In 1940, the reference was to attendance in the month preceding the census, and in the 1950 and subsequent censuses, the question referred to attendance in the two months preceding the census date.   Until the 1910 census, there were no instructions limiting the kinds of schools in which enrollment was to be counted. Starting in 1910, the instructions indicated that attendance at ""school, college, or any educational institution"" was to be counted. In 1930 an instruction to include ""night school"" was added. In the 1940 instructions, night school, extension school, or vocational school were included only if the school was part of the regular school system. Correspondence school work of any kind was excluded. In the 1950 instructions, the term ""regular school"" was introduced, and it was defined as schooling which ""advances a person towards an elementary or high school diploma or a college, university, or professional school degree."" Vocational, trade, or business schools were excluded unless they were graded and considered part of a regular school system. On-the-job training was excluded, as was nursery school. Instruction by correspondence was excluded unless it was given by a regular school and counted towards promotion.   In 1960, the question used the term ""regular school or college"" and a similar, though expanded, definition of ""regular"" was included in the instructions, which continued to exclude nursery school. Because of the census' use of mailed questionnaires, the 1960 census was the first in which instructions were written for the respondent as well as enumerators. In the 1970 census, the questionnaire used the phrase ""regular school or college"" and included instructions to ""count nursery school, kindergarten, and schooling which leads to an elementary school certificate, high school diploma, or college degree."" Instructions in a separate document specified that to be counted as regular school, nursery school must include instruction as an important and integral phase of its program, and continued the exclusion of vocational, trade, and business schools. The 1980 census question was very similar to the 1970 question, but the separate instruction booklet did not require that nursery school include substantial instructional content in order to be counted.   The age range for which enrollment data have been obtained and published has varied over the censuses. Information on enrollment was recorded for persons of all ages in the 1930 and 1940 and 1970 through 1990; for persons under age 30, in 1950; and for persons age 5 to 34, in 1960. Most of the published enrollment figures referred to persons age 5 to 20 in the 1930 census, 5 to 24 in 1940, 5 to 29 in 1950, 5 to 34 in 1960, 3 to 34 in 1970, and 3 years old and over in 1980. This growth in the age group whose enrollment was reported reflects increased interest in the number of children in preprimary schools and in the number of older persons attending colleges and universities.   In the 1950 and subsequent censuses, college students were enumerated where they lived while attending college, whereas in earlier censuses, they generally were enumerated at their parental homes. This change should not affect the comparability of national figures on college enrollment since 1940; however, it may affect the comparability over time of enrollment figures at sub-national levels.   Type of school was first introduced in the 1960 census, where a separate question asked the enrolled persons whether they were in a ""public"" or ""private"" school. Since the 1970 census, the type of school was incorporated into the response categories for the enrollment question and the terms were changed to ""public,"" ""parochial,"" and ""other private."" In the 1980 census, ""private, church related"" and ""private, not church related"" replaced ""parochial"" and ""other private.""   Grade of enrollment was first available in the 1940 census, where it was obtained from responses to the question on highest grade of school completed. Enumerators were instructed that ""for a person still in school, the last grade completed will be the grade preceding the one in which he or she was now enrolled."" From 1950 to 1980, grade of enrollment was obtained from the highest grade attended in the two-part question used to measure educational attainment. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Educational Attainment."") The form of the question from which level of enrollment was derived in the 1990 census most closely corresponds to the question used in 1940. While data from prior censuses can be aggregated to provide levels of enrollment comparable to the 1990 census, 1990 data cannot be disaggregated to show single grade of enrollment as in previous censuses.   Data on school enrollment were also collected and published by other Federal, State, and local government agencies. Where these data were obtained from administrative records of school systems and institutions of higher learning, they were only roughly comparable with data from population censuses and household surveys because of differences in definitions and concepts, subject matter covered, time references, and enumeration methods. At the local level, the difference between the location of the institution and the residence of the student may affect the comparability of census and administrative data. Differences between the boundaries of school districts and census geographic units also may affect these comparisons.    SELF-CARE LIMITATION STATUS    The data on self-care limitation status were derived from answers to questionnaire item 19b, which was asked of a sample of persons 15 years old and over. Persons were identified as having a self-care limitation if they had a health condition that had lasted for 6 or more months and which made it difficult to take care of their own personal needs, such as dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home.   The term ""health condition"" referred to both physical and mental conditions. A temporary health problem, such as a broken bone that was expected to heal normally was not considered a health condition.   Comparability--This was the first time that a question on self-care limitation was included in the census.    SEX    The data on sex were derived from answers to questionnaire item 3, which was asked of all persons. For most cases in which sex was not reported, it was determined by the appropriate entry from the person's given name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was imputed according to the relationship to the householder and the age and marital status of the person. For more information on imputation, see Appendix C, Accuracy of the Data.   Sex Ratio--A measure derived by dividing the total number of males by the  total number of females and multiplying by 100.   Comparability--A question on the sex of individuals has been asked of the total population in every census.    VETERAN STATUS    Data on veteran status, period of military service, and years of military service were derived from answers to questionnaire item 17, which was asked of a sample of persons.   Veteran Status--The data on veteran status were derived from responses to  question 17a.  For census data products, a ""civilian veteran"" is a person 16 years old or over who had served (even for a short time) but is not now serving on active duty in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard, or who served as a Merchant Marine seaman during World War II. Persons who served in the National Guard or military Reserves are classified as veterans only if they were ever called or ordered to active duty not counting the 4-6 months for initial training or yearly summer camps. All other civilians 16 years old and over are classified as nonveterans.   Period of Military Service--Persons who indicated in question 17a that they had served on active duty (civilian veterans) or were now on active duty were asked to indicate in question 17b the period or periods in which they served.  Persons serving in at least one wartime period are classified in their most recent wartime period. For example, persons who served both during the Korean conflict and the post-Korean peacetime era between February 1955 and July 1964 are classified in one of the two ""Korean conflict"" categories. If the same person had also served during the Vietnam era, he or she would instead be included in the ""Vietnam era and Korean conflict"" category. The responses were edited to eliminate inconsistencies between reported period(s) of service and the age of the person and to cancel out reported combinations of periods containing unreasonable gaps (for example, a person could not serve during World War I and the Korean conflict without serving during World War II). Note that the period of service categories shown in this report are mutually exclusive.   Years of Military Service--Persons who indicated in question 17a that they had served on active duty (civilian veterans) or were now on active duty were asked to report the total number of years of active-duty service in question 17c. The data were edited for consistency with responses to question 17b (Period of Military Service) and with the age of the person.   Limitation of the Data--There may be a tendency for the following kinds of persons to report erroneously that they served on active duty in the Armed Forces: (a) persons who served in the National Guard or military Reserves but were never called to active duty; (b) civilian employees or volunteers for the USO, Red Cross, or the Department of Defense (or its predecessor Departments, War and Navy); and (c) employees of the Merchant Marine or Public Health Service. There may also be a tendency for persons to erroneously round up months to the nearest year in question 17c (for example, persons with 1 year 8 months of active duty military service may mistakenly report ""2 years"").   Comparability--Since census data on veterans were based on self-reported responses, they may differ from data from other sources such as administrative records of the Department of Defense. Census data may also differ from Veterans Administration data on the benefits-eligible population, since factors determining eligibility for veterans benefits differ from the rules for classifying veterans in the census.   The wording of the question on veteran status (17a) for 1990 was expanded from the veteran/not veteran question in 1980 to include questions on current active duty status and service in the military Reserves and the National Guard. The expansion was intended to clarify the appropriate response for persons in the Armed Forces and for persons who served in the National Guard or military Reserve units only. For the first time in a census, service during World War II as a Merchant Marine Seaman was considered active-duty military service and persons with such service were counted as veterans. An additional period of military service, ""September 1980 or later"" was added in 1990. As in 1970 and 1980, persons reporting more than one period of service are shown in the most recent wartime period of service category. Question 17c (Years of Military Service) was new for 1990.    WORK DISABILITY STATUS    The data on work disability were derived from answers to questionnaire item 18, which was asked of a sample of persons 15 years old and over. Persons were identified as having a work disability if they had a health condition that had lasted for 6 or more months and which limited the kind or amount of work they could do at a job or business. A person was limited in the kind of work he or she could do if the person had a health condition which restricted his or her choice of jobs. A person was limited in the amount of work if he or she was not able to work full-time. Persons with a work disability were further classified as ""Prevented from working"" or ""Not prevented from working.""   The term ""health condition"" referred to both physical and mental conditions. A temporary health problem, such as a broken bone that was expected to heal normally, was not considered a health condition.   Comparability--The wording of the question on work disability was the same in 1990 as in 1980. Information on work disability was first collected in 1970. In that census, the work disability question did not contain a clause restricting the definition of disability to limitations caused by a health condition that had lasted 6 or more months; however, it did contain a separate question about the duration of the disability.    WORK STATUS IN 1989    The data on work status in 1989 were derived from answers to questionnaire item 31, which was asked of a sample of persons. Persons 16 years old and over who worked 1 or more weeks according to the criteria described below are classified as ""Worked in 1989."" All other persons 16 years old and over are classified as ""Did not work in 1989."" Some tabulations showing work status in 1989 include 15 year olds; these persons, by definition, are classified as ""Did not work in 1989.""   Weeks Worked in 1989   The data on weeks worked in 1989 were derived from responses to questionnaire item 31b. Question 31b (Weeks Worked in 1989) was asked of persons 16 years old and over who indicated in question 31a that they worked in 1989.   The data pertain to the number of weeks during 1989 in which a person did any work for pay or profit (including paid vacation and paid sick leave) or worked without pay on a family farm or in a family business. Weeks of active service in the Armed Forces are also included.   Usual Hours Worked Per Week Worked in 1989   The data on usual hours worked per week worked in 1989 were derived from answers to questionnaire item 31c. This question was asked of persons 16 years old and over who indicated that they worked in 1989.   The data pertain to the number of hours a person usually worked during the weeks worked in 1989. The respondent was to report the number of hours worked per week in the majority of the weeks he or she worked in 1989. If the hours worked per week varied considerably during 1989, the respondent was to report an approximate average of the hours worked per week. The statistics on usual hours worked per week in 1989 are not necessarily related to the data on actual hours worked during the census reference week (question 21b).   Persons 16 years old and over who reported that they usually worked 35 or more hours each week during the weeks they worked are classified as ""Usually worked full time;"" persons who reported that they usually worked 1 to 34 hours are classified as ""Usually worked part time.""   Year-Round Full-Time Workers--All persons 16 years old and over who usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 to 52 weeks in 1989.   Number of Workers in Family in 1989--The term ""worker"" as used for these data is defined based on the criteria for Work Status in 1989.   Limitation of the Data--It is probable that the number of persons who worked in 1989 and the number of weeks worked are understated since there was some tendency for respondents to forget intermittent or short periods of employment or to exclude weeks worked without pay. There may also be a tendency for persons not to include weeks of paid vacation among their weeks worked; one result may be that the census figures may understate the number of persons who worked ""50 to 52 weeks.""   Comparability--The data on weeks worked collected in the 1990 census were comparable with data from the 1980, 1970, and 1960 censuses, but may not be entirely comparable with data from the 1940 and 1950 censuses. Since the 1960 census, two separate questions have been used to obtain this information. The first identified persons with any work experience during the year and, thus, indicated those persons for whom the questions on number of weeks worked applied. In 1940 and 1950, however, the questionnaires contained only a single question on number of weeks worked.   In 1970, persons responded to the question on weeks worked by indicating one of six weeks-worked intervals. In 1980 and 1990, persons were asked to enter the specific number of weeks they worked.    YEAR OF ENTRY    The data on year of entry were derived from answers to questionnaire item 10, which was asked of a sample of persons. The question, ""When did this person come to the United States to stay?"" was asked of persons who indicated in the question on citizenship that they were not born in the United States. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Citizenship."")   The 1990 census questions, tabulations, and census data products about citizenship and year of entry include no reference to immigration. All persons who were born and resided outside the United States before becoming residents of the United States have a date of entry. Some of these persons are U.S. citizens by birth (e.g., persons born in Puerto Rico or born abroad of American parents). To avoid any possible confusion concerning the date of entry of persons who are U.S. citizens by birth, the term, ""year of entry"" is used in this report instead of the term ""year of immigration.""   Limitation of the Data--The census questions on nativity, citizenship, and year of entry were not designed to measure the degree of permanence of residence in the United States. The phrase, ""to stay"" was used to obtain the year in which the person became a resident of the United States. Although the respondent was directed to indicate the year he or she entered the country ""to stay,"" it was difficult to ensure that respondents interpreted the phrase correctly.   Comparability--A question on year of entry, (alternately called ""year of immigration"") was asked in each decennial census from 1890 to 1930, 1970, and 1980. In 1980, the question on year of entry included six arrival time intervals. The number of arrival intervals was expanded to ten in 1990. In 1980, the question on year of entry was asked only of the foreign-born population. In 1990, all persons who responded to the long-form questionnaire and were not born in the United States were to complete the question on year of entry.    HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS     LIVING QUARTERS    Living quarters are classified as either housing units or group quarters. (For more information, see the discussion of ""Group Quarters"" under Population Characteristics.) Usually, living quarters are in structures intended for residential use (for example, a one-family home, apartment house, hotel or motel, boarding house, or mobile home). Living quarters also may be in structures intended for nonresidential use (for example, the rooms in a warehouse where a guard lives), as well as in places such as tents, vans, shelters for the homeless, dormitories, barracks, and old railroad cars.   Housing Units--A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms or a single room occupied as separate living quarters or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall.   The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants.   Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory, except that recreational vehicles, boats, vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's usual place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory.   If the living quarters contains nine or more persons unrelated to the householder or person in charge (a total of at least 10 unrelated persons), it is classified as group quarters. If the living quarters contains eight or fewer persons unrelated to the householder or person in charge, it is classified as a housing unit.   Occupied Housing Units--A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the usual place of residence of the person or group of persons living in it at the time of enumeration, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent; that is, away on vacation or business. If all the persons staying in the unit at the time of the census have their usual place of residence elsewhere, the unit is classified as vacant. A household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of residence. By definition, the count of occupied housing units for 100-percent tabulations is the same as the count of households or householders. In sample tabulations, the counts of household and occupied housing units may vary slightly because of different sample weighting methods.   Vacant Housing Units--A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of enumeration, unless its occupants are only temporarily absent. Units temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration entirely by persons who have a usual residence elsewhere also are classified as vacant. (For more information, see discussion under ""Usual Home Elsewhere."")   New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are excluded if they are open to the elements; that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements, or if there is positive evidence (such as a sign on the house or in the block) that the unit is condemned or is to be demolished. Also excluded are quarters being used entirely for nonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.   Hotels, Motels, Rooming Houses, Etc.--Occupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents; that is, persons who consider the hotel as their usual place of residence or have no usual place of residence elsewhere. Vacant rooms or suites of rooms are classified as housing units only in those hotels, motels, and similar places in which 75 percent or more of the accommodations are occupied by permanent residents.   If any of the occupants in a rooming or boarding house live and eat separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are classified as separate housing units.   Staff Living Quarters--The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.   Comparability--The first Census of Housing in 1940 established the ""dwelling unit"" concept. Although the term became ""housing unit"" and the definition has been modified slightly in succeeding censuses, the 1990 definition is essentially comparable to previous censuses. There was no change in the housing unit definition between 1980 and 1990.    ACREAGE    The data on acreage were obtained from questionnaire items H5a and H19a. Question H5a was asked at all occupied and vacant one-family houses and mobile homes. Question H19a was asked on a sample basis at occupied and vacant one-family houses and mobile homes.     Question H5a asks whether the house or mobile home is located on a place of 10 or more acres. The intent of this item is to exclude owner-occupied and renter-occupied one-family houses on 10 or more acres from the specified owner- and renter-occupied universes for value and rent tabulations.     Question H19a provides data on whether the unit is located on less than 1 acre. The main purpose of this item, in conjunction with question H19b on agricultural sales, is to identify farm units. (For more information, see discussion under ""Farm Residence."")     For both items, the land may consist of more than one tract or plot. These tracts or plots are usually adjoining; however, they may be separated by a road, creek, another piece of land, etc.   Comparability--    Question H5a is similar to that asked in 1970 and 1980. This item was asked for the first time of mobile home occupants in 1990. Question H19a is an abbreviated form of a question asked on a sample basis in 1980. In previous censuses, information on city or suburban lot and number of acres was obtained also.    AGRICULTURAL SALES    Data on the sales of agricultural crops were obtained from questionnaire item H19b, which was asked on a sample basis at occupied one-family houses and mobile homes located on lots of 1 acre or more. Data for this item exclude units on lots of less than 1 acre, units located in structures containing 2 or more units, and all vacant units. This item refers to the total amount (before taxes and expenses) received in 1989 from the sale of crops, vegetables, fruits, nuts, livestock and livestock products, and nursery and forest products, produced on ""this property."" Respondents new to a unit were asked to estimate total agricultural sales in 1989 even if some portion of the sales had been made by other occupants of the unit.  This item is used mainly to classify housing units as farm or nonfarm residences, not to provide detailed information on the sale of agricultural products. Detailed information on the sale of agricultural products is provided by the Census Bureau's Census of Agriculture (Factfinder for the Nation: Agricultural Statistics, Bureau of the Census, 1989). (For more information, see the discussion under ""Farm Residence."")   BEDROOMS    The data on bedrooms were obtained from questionnaire item H9, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. This item was asked on a sample basis. The number of bedrooms is the count of rooms designed to be used as bedrooms; that is, the number of rooms that would be listed as bedrooms if the house or apartment were on the market for sale or for rent. Included are all rooms intended to be used as bedrooms even if they currently are being used for some other purpose. A housing unit consisting of only one room, such as a one-room efficiency apartment, is classified, by definition, as having no bedroom.   Comparability--Data on bedrooms have been collected in every census since 1960. In 1970 and 1980, data for bedrooms were shown only for year-round units.  In past censuses, a room was defined as a bedroom if it was used mainly for sleeping even if also used for other purposes. Rooms that were designed to be used as bedrooms but used mainly for other purposes were not considered to be bedrooms. A distribution of housing units by number of bedrooms calculated from data collected in a 1986 test showed virtually no differences in the two versions except in the two bedroom category, where the previous ""use"" definition showed a slightly lower proportion of units.    BOARDED-UP STATUS    Boarded-up status was obtained from questionnaire item C2 and was determined for all vacant units. Boarded-up units have windows and doors covered by wood, metal, or masonry to protect the interior and to prevent entry into the building. A single-unit structure, a unit in a multi-unit structure, or an entire multi-unit structure may be boarded-up in this way. For certain census data products, boarded-up units are shown only for units in the ""Other vacant"" category. A unit classified as ""Usual home elsewhere"" can never be boarded up. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Usual Home Elsewhere."")   Comparability--This item was first asked in the 1980 census and was shown only for year-round vacant housing units. In 1990, data are shown for all vacant housing units.    BUSINESS ON PROPERTY    The data for business on property were obtained from questionnaire item H5b, which was asked at all occupied and vacant one-family houses and mobile homes. This question is used to exclude owner-occupied one-family houses with business or medical offices on the property from certain statistics on financial characteristics.     A business must be easily recognizable from the outside. It usually will have a separate outside entrance and have the appearance of a business, such as a grocery store, restaurant, or barber shop. It may be either attached to the house or mobile home or be located elsewhere on the property. Those housing units in which a room is used for business or professional purposes and have no recognizable alterations to the outside are not considered as having a business. Medical offices are considered businesses for tabulation purposes.   Comparability--Data on business on property have been collected since 1940.   CONDOMINIUM FEE    The data on condominium fee were obtained from questionnaire item H25, which was asked at owner-occupied condominiums. This item was asked on a sample basis. A condominium fee normally is charged monthly to the owners of the individual condominium units by the condominium owners association to cover operating, maintenance, administrative, and improvement costs of the common property (grounds, halls, lobby, parking areas, laundry rooms, swimming pool, etc.) The costs for utilities and/or fuels may be included in the condominium fee if the units do not have separate meters.   Data on condominium fees may include real estate tax and/or insurance payments for the common property, but do not include real estate taxes or fire, hazard, and flood insurance for the individual unit already reported in questions H21 and H22.   Amounts reported were the regular monthly payment, even if paid by someone outside the household or remain unpaid. Costs were estimated as closely as possible when exact costs were not known.   The data from this item were added to payments for mortgages (both first and junior mortgages and home equity loans); real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments; and utilities and fuels to derive ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs"" and ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989"" for condominium owners.   Comparability--This is a new item in 1990.    CONDOMINIUM STATUS    The data on condominium housing units were obtained from questionnaire item H18, which was asked on a sample basis at both occupied and vacant housing units. Condominium is a type of ownership that enables a person to own an apartment or house in a development of similarly owned units and to hold a common or joint ownership in some or all of the common areas and facilities such as land, roof, hallways, entrances, elevators, swimming pool, etc. Condominiums may be single-family houses as well as units in apartment buildings. A condominium unit need not be occupied by the owner to be counted as such. A unit classified as ""mobile home or trailer"" or ""other"" (see discussion under ""Units in Structure"") cannot be a condominium unit.   Limitation of the Data--Testing done prior to the 1980 and 1990 censuses indicated that the number of condominiums may be slightly overstated.   Comparability--In 1970, condominiums were grouped together with cooperative housing units, and the data were reported only for owner-occupied cooperatives and condominiums. Beginning in 1980, the census identified all condominium units and the data were shown for renter-occupied and vacant year-round condominiums as well as owner occupied.  In 1970 and 1980, the question on condominiums was asked on a 100-percent basis. In 1990, it was asked on a sample basis.    CONTRACT RENT    The data on contract rent (also referred to as ""rent asked"" for vacant units) were obtained from questionnaire item H7a, which was asked at all occupied housing units that were rented for cash rent and all vacant housing units that were for rent at the time of enumeration.  Housing units that are renter occupied without payment of cash rent are shown separately as ""No cash rent"" in census data products. The unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who allow occupancy without charge. Rent-free houses or apartments may be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, or others.   Contract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of enumeration.   If the contract rent includes rent for a business unit or for living quarters occupied by another household, the respondent was instructed to report that part of the rent estimated to be for his or her unit only. Respondents were asked to report rent only for the housing unit enumerated and to exclude any rent paid for additional units or for business premises.   If a renter pays rent to the owner of a condominium or cooperative, and the condominium fee or cooperative carrying charge is also paid by the renter to the owner, the respondent was instructed to include the fee or carrying charge.   If a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed as members of the household, the respondent was instructed to report the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers or roomers. The respondent was instructed to report the rent agreed to or contracted for even if paid by someone else such as friends or relatives living elsewhere, or a church or welfare agency.   In some tabulations, contract rent is presented for all renter-occupied housing units, as well as specified renter-occupied and vacant-for-rent units. Specified renter-occupied and specified vacant-for-rent units exclude one-family houses on 10 or more acres. (For more information on rent, see the discussion under ""Gross Rent."")   Median and Quartile Contract Rent--The median divides the rent distribution into two equal parts.   Quartiles divide the rent distribution into four equal parts. In computing median and quartile contract rent, units reported as ""No cash rent"" are excluded. Median and quartile rent calculations are rounded to the nearest whole dollar. (For more information on medians and quartiles, see the discussion under ""Derived Measures."")   Aggregate Contract Rent--To calculate aggregate contract rent, the amount assigned for the category ""Less than $80"" is $50. The amount assigned to the category ""$1,000 or more"" is $1,250. Mean contract rent is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. (For more information on aggregates and means, see the discussion under ""Derived Measures."")   Limitation of the Data--In the 1970 and 1980 censuses, contract rent for vacant units had high allocation rates, about 35 percent.   Comparability--Data on this item have been collected since 1930. For 1990, quartiles were added because the range of rents and values in the United States has increased in recent years. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large rent and value differences among various geographic areas.    DURATION OF VACANCY    The data for duration of vacancy (also referred to as ""months vacant"") were obtained from questionnaire item D, which was completed by census enumerators. The statistics on duration of vacancy refer to the length of time (in months and years) between the date the last occupants moved from the unit and the time of enumeration. The data, therefore, do not provide a direct measure of the total length of time units remain vacant.   For newly constructed units which have never been occupied, the duration of vacancy is counted from the date construction was completed. For recently converted or merged units, the time is reported from the date conversion or merger was completed. Units occupied by an entire household with a usual home elsewhere are assigned to the ""Less than 1 month"" interval.   Comparability--Similar data have been collected since 1960. In 1970 and 1980, these data were shown only for year-round vacant housing units. In 1990, these data are shown for all vacant housing units.    FARM RESIDENCE    The data on farm residence were obtained from questionnaire items H19a and H19b. An occupied one-family house or mobile home is classified as a farm residence if: (1) the housing unit is located on a property of 1 acre or more, and (2) at least $1,000 worth of agricultural products were sold from the property in 1989. Group quarters and housing units that are in multi-unit buildings or vacant are not included as farm residences.   A one-family unit occupied by a tenant household paying cash rent for land and buildings is enumerated as a farm residence only if sales of agricultural products from its yard (as opposed to the general property on which it is located) amounted to at least $1,000 in 1989. A one-family unit occupied by a tenant household that does not pay cash rent is enumerated as a farm residence if the remainder of the farm (including its yard) qualifies as a farm.   Farm residence is provided as an independent data item only for housing units located in rural areas. It may be derived for housing units in urban areas from the data items on acreage and sales of agricultural products on the public-use microdata sample (PUMS) files. (For more information on PUMS, see Appendix F, Data Products and User Assistance.)   The farm population consists of persons in households living in farm residences. Some persons who are counted on a property classified as a farm (including in some cases farm workers) are excluded from the farm population. Such persons include those who reside in multi-unit buildings or group quarters.   Comparability--These are the same criteria that were used to define a farm residence in 1980. In 1960 and 1970, a farm was defined as a place of 10 or more acres with at least $50 worth of agricultural sales or a place of less than 10 acres with at least $250 worth of agricultural sales. Earlier censuses used other definitions. Note that the definition of a farm residence differs from the definition of a farm in the Census of Agriculture (Factfinder for the Nation: Agricultural Statistics, Bureau of the Census, 1989).    GROSS RENT    Gross rent is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, and water) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid for by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Gross rent is intended to eliminate differentials which result from varying practices with respect to the inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental payment. The estimated costs of utilities and fuels are reported on a yearly basis but are converted to monthly figures for the tabulations. Renter units occupied without payment of cash rent are shown separately as ""No cash rent"" in the tabulations. Gross rent is calculated on a sample basis.   Comparability--Data on gross rent have been collected since 1940 for renter-occupied housing units. In 1980, costs for electricity and gas were collected as average monthly costs. In 1990, all utility and fuel costs were collected as yearly costs and divided by 12 to provide an average monthly cost.    GROSS RENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN 1989    Gross rent as a percentage of household income in 1989 is a computed ratio of monthly gross rent to monthly household income (total household income in 1989 divided by 12). The ratio was computed separately for each unit and was rounded to the nearest whole percentage. Units for which no cash rent is paid and units occupied by households that reported no income or a net loss in 1989 comprise the category ""Not computed."" This item is calculated on a sample basis.    HOUSE HEATING FUEL    The data on house heating fuel were obtained from questionnaire item H14, which was asked at occupied housing units. This item was asked on a sample basis. The data show the type of fuel used most to heat the house or apartment.   Utility Gas--Includes gas piped through underground pipes from a central system to serve the neighborhood.   Bottled, Tank, or LP Gas--Includes liquid propane gas stored in bottles or tanks which are refilled or exchanged when empty.   Fuel Oil, Kerosene, Etc.--Includes fuel oil, kerosene, gasoline, alcohol, and other combustible liquids.   Wood--Includes purchased wood, wood cut by household members on their property or elsewhere, driftwood, sawmill or construction scraps, or the like.   Solar Energy--Includes heat provided by sunlight which is collected, stored, and actively distributed to most of the rooms.   Other Fuel--Includes all other fuels not specified elsewhere.   No Fuel Used--Includes units that do not use any fuel or that do not have  heating equipment.   Comparability--Data on house heating fuel have been collected since 1940. The category, ""Solar energy"" is new for 1990.    INSURANCE FOR FIRE, HAZARD, AND FLOOD    The data on fire, hazard, and flood insurance were obtained from questionnaire item H22, which was asked at a sample of owner-occupied one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. The statistics for this item refer to the annual premium for fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the property (land and buildings); that is, policies that protect the property and its contents against loss due to damage by fire, lightning, winds, hail, flood, explosion, and so on.   Liability policies are included only if they are paid with the fire, hazard, and flood insurance premiums and the amounts for fire, hazard, and flood cannot be separated. Premiums are included even if paid by someone outside the household or remain unpaid. When premiums are paid on other than a yearly basis, the premiums are converted to a yearly basis.   The payment for fire, hazard, and flood insurance is added to payments for real estate taxes, utilities, fuels, and mortgages (both first and junior mortgages and home equity loans) to derive ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs"" and ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989.""   A separate question (H23d) determines whether insurance premiums are included in the mortgage payment to the lender(s). This makes it possible to avoid counting these premiums twice in the computations.   Comparability--Data on payment for fire and hazard insurance were collected for the first time in 1980. Flood insurance was not specifically mentioned in the wording of the question in 1980. The question was asked only at owner-occupied one-family houses. Excluded were mobile homes, condominiums, houses with a business or medical office on the property, houses on 10 or more acres, and housing units in multi-unit buildings. In 1990, the question was asked of all one-family owner-occupied houses, including houses on 10 or more acres. It also was asked at mobile homes, condominiums, and one-family houses with a business or medical office on the property.    KITCHEN FACILITIES    Data on kitchen facilities were obtained from questionnaire item H11, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. A unit has complete kitchen facilities when it has all of the following: (1) an installed sink with piped water, (2) a range, cook top and convection or microwave oven, or cookstove, and (3) a refrigerator. All kitchen facilities must be located in the structure. They need not be in the same room. Portable cooking equipment is not considered a range or cookstove. An ice box is not considered to be a refrigerator.   Comparability--Data on complete kitchen facilities were collected for the first time in 1970. Earlier censuses collected data on individual components, such as kitchen sink and type of refrigeration equipment. In 1970 and 1980, data for kitchen facilities were shown only for year-round units. In 1990, data are shown for all housing units.    MEALS INCLUDED IN RENT    The data on meals included in the rent were obtained from questionnaire item H7b, which was asked of all occupied housing units that were rented for cash and all vacant housing units that were for rent at the time of enumeration.   The statistics on meals included in rent are presented for specified renter-occupied and specified vacant-for-rent units. Specified renter-occupied and specified vacant-for-rent units exclude one-family houses on 10 or more acres. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Contract Rent."")   Comparability--This is a new item in 1990. It is intended to measure ""congregate"" housing, which generally is considered to be housing units where the rent includes meals and other services, such as transportation to shopping and recreation.    MOBILE HOME COSTS    The data on mobile home costs were obtained from questionnaire item H26, which was asked at owner-occupied mobile homes. This item was asked on a sample basis.   These data include the total yearly costs for personal property taxes, land or site rent, registration fees, and license fees on all owner-occupied mobile homes. The instructions are to not include real estate taxes already reported in question H21.   Costs are estimated as closely as possible when exact costs are not known. Amounts are the total for an entire 12-month billing period, even if they are paid by someone outside the household or remain unpaid.   The data from this item are added to payments for mortgages, real estate taxes, fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments, utilities, and fuels to derive selected monthly owner costs for mobile homes owners.   Comparability--This item is new for 1990.    MORTGAGE PAYMENT    The data on mortgage payment were obtained from questionnaire item H23b, which was asked at owner occupied one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. This item was asked on a sample basis. Question H23b provides the regular monthly amount required to be paid the lender for the first mortgage (deed of trust, contract to purchase, or similar debt) on the property. Amounts are included even if the payments are delinquent or paid by someone else. The amounts reported are included in the computation of ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs"" and ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989"" for units with a mortgage.   The amounts reported include everything paid to the lender including principal and interest payments, real estate taxes, fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments, and mortgage insurance premiums. Separate questions determine whether real estate taxes and fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments are included in the mortgage payment to the lender. This makes it possible to avoid counting these components twice in the computation of ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs.""   Comparability--Information on mortgage payment was collected for the first time in 1980. It was collected only at owner-occupied one-family houses. Excluded were mobile homes, condominiums, houses with a business or medical office on the property, one-family houses on 10 or more acres, and housing units in multi-unit buildings. In 1990, the questions on monthly mortgage payments were asked of all owner-occupied one-family houses, including one-family houses on 10 or more acres. They were also asked at mobile homes, condominiums, and one-family houses with a business or medical office.   The 1980 census obtained total regular monthly mortgage payments, including payments on second or junior mortgages, from a single question. Two questions were used in 1990; one for regular monthly payments on first mortgages, and one for regular monthly payments on second or junior mortgages or home equity loans. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Second or Junior Mortgage Payment."")    MORTGAGE STATUS    The data on mortgage status were obtained from questionnaire items H23a and H24a, which were asked at owner-occupied one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. ""Mortgage"" refers to all forms of debt where the property is pledged as security for repayment of the debt. It includes such debt instruments as deeds of trust, trust deeds, contracts to purchase, land contracts, junior mortgages and home equity loans.   A mortgage is considered a first mortgage if it has prior claim over any other mortgage or if it is the only mortgage on the property. All other mortgages, (second, third, etc.) are considered junior mortgages. A home equity loan is generally a junior mortgage. If no first mortgage is reported, but a junior mortgage or home equity loan is reported, then the loan is considered a first mortgage.   In most census data products, the tabulations for ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs"" and ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989"" usually are shown separately for units ""with a mortgage"" and for units ""not mortgaged."" The category ""not mortgaged"" is comprised of housing units owned free and clear of debt.   Comparability--A question on mortgage status was included in the 1940 and 1950 censuses, but not in the 1960 and 1970 censuses. The item was reinstated in 1980 along with a separate question dealing with the existence of second or junior mortgages. In 1980, the mortgage status questions were asked at owner-occupied one-family houses on less than 10 acres. Excluded were mobile homes, condominiums, houses with a business or medical office, houses on 10 or more acres, and housing units in multi-unit buildings. In 1990, the questions were asked of all one-family owner-occupied housing units, including houses on 10 or more acres. They were also asked at mobile homes, condominiums, and houses with a business or medical office.    PERSONS IN UNIT    This item is based on the 100-percent count of persons in occupied housing units. All persons occupying the housing unit are counted, including the householder, occupants related to the householder, and lodgers, roomers, boarders, and so forth.   The data on ""persons in unit"" show the number of housing units occupied by the specified number of persons. The phrase ""persons in unit"" is used for housing tabulations, ""persons in households"" for population items. Figures for ""persons in unit"" match those for ""persons in household"" for 100-percent data products. In sample products, they may differ because of the weighting process.   Median Persons in Unit--In computing median persons in unit, a whole number is used as the midpoint of an interval; thus, a unit with 4 persons is treated as an interval ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 persons. Median persons is rounded to the nearest hundredth. (For more information on medians, see the discussion under ""Derived Measures."")   Persons in Occupied Housing Units--This is the total population minus those persons living in group quarters. ""Persons per occupied housing unit"" is computed by dividing the population living in housing units by the number of occupied housing units.    PERSONS PER ROOM    ""Persons per room"" is obtained by dividing the number of persons in each occupied housing unit by the number of rooms in the unit. Persons per room is rounded to the nearest hundredth. The figures shown refer, therefore, to the number of occupied housing units having the specified ratio of persons per room.   Mean Persons Per Room--This is computed by dividing persons in housing units by the aggregate number of rooms. This is intended to provide a measure of utilization.  A higher mean may indicate a greater degree of utilization or crowding; a low mean may indicate under-utilization. (For more information on means, see the discussion under ""Derived Measures."")    PLUMBING FACILITIES    The data on plumbing facilities were obtained from questionnaire item H10, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. This item was asked on a sample basis. Complete plumbing facilities include hot and cold piped water, a flush toilet, and a bathtub or shower. All three facilities must be located inside the house, apartment, or mobile home, but not necessarily in the same room. Housing units are classified as lacking complete plumbing facilities when any of the three facilities are not present.   Comparability--The 1990 data on complete plumbing facilities are not strictly comparable with the 1980 data. In 1980, complete plumbing facilities were defined as hot and cold piped water, a bathtub or shower, and a flush toilet in the housing unit for the exclusive use of the residents of that unit. In 1990, the Census Bureau dropped the requirement of exclusive use from the definition of complete plumbing facilities. Of the 2.3 million year-round housing units classified in 1980 as lacking complete plumbing for exclusive use, approximately 25 percent of these units had complete plumbing but the facilities were also used by members of another household. From 1940 to 1970, separate and more detailed questions were asked on piped water, bathing, and toilet facilities. In 1970 and 1980, the data on plumbing facilities were shown only for year-round units.    POVERTY STATUS OF HOUSEHOLDS IN 1989    The data on poverty status of households were derived from answers to the income questions. The income items were asked on a sample basis. Households are classified below the poverty level when the total 1989 income of the family or of the nonfamily householder is below the appropriate poverty threshold. The income of persons living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the household size in determining the appropriate poverty threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three criteria: size of family, number of children, and age of the family householder or unrelated individual for one and two-persons households. (For more information, see the discussion of ""Poverty Status in 1989"" and ""Income in 1989"" under Population Characteristics.)    REAL ESTATE TAXES    The data on real estate taxes were obtained from questionnaire item H21, which was asked at owner-occupied one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. The statistics from this question refer to the total amount of all real estate taxes on the entire property (land and buildings) payable in 1989 to all taxing jurisdictions, including special assessments, school taxes, county taxes, and so forth.   Real estate taxes include State, local, and all other real estate taxes even if delinquent, unpaid, or paid by someone who is not a member of the household. However, taxes due from prior years are not included. If taxes are paid on other than a yearly basis, the payments are converted to a yearly basis.   The payment for real estate taxes is added to payments for fire, hazard, and flood insurance; utilities and fuels; and mortgages (both first and junior mortgages and home equity loans) to derive ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs"" and ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989."" A separate question (H23c) determines whether real estate taxes are included in the mortgage payment to the lender(s). This makes it possible to avoid counting taxes twice in the computations.   Comparability--Data for real estate taxes were collected for the first time in 1980.  The question was asked only at owner-occupied one-family houses. Excluded were mobile homes or trailers, condominiums, houses with a business or medical office on the property, houses on 10 or more acres, and housing units in multi-unit buildings. In 1990, the question was asked of all one-family owner-occupied houses, including houses on 10 or more acres. It also was asked at mobile homes, condominiums, and one-family houses with a business or medical office on the property.    ROOMS    The data on rooms were obtained from questionnaire item H3, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. The statistics on rooms are in terms of the number of housing units with a specified number of rooms. The intent of this question is to count the number of whole rooms used for living purposes.   For each unit, rooms include living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, bedrooms, finished recreation rooms, enclosed porches suitable for year-round use, and lodger's rooms. Excluded are strip or pullman kitchens, bathrooms, open porches, balconies, halls or foyers, half-rooms, utility rooms, unfinished attics or basements, or other unfinished space used for storage. A partially divided room is a separate room only if there is a partition from floor to ceiling, but not if the partition consists solely of shelves or cabinets.   Median Rooms--This measure divides the room distribution into two equal parts, one-half of the cases falling below the median number of rooms and one-half above the median. In computing median rooms, the whole number is used as the midpoint of the interval; thus, the category ""3 rooms"" is treated as an interval ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 rooms. Median rooms is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on medians, see the discussion under ""Derived Measures."")   Aggregate Rooms--To calculate aggregate rooms, an arbitrary value of ""10"" is assigned to rooms for units falling within the terminal category, ""9 or more."" (For more information on aggregates and means, see the discussion under ""Derived Measures."")   Comparability--Data on rooms have been collected since 1940. In 1970 and 1980, these data were shown only for year-round housing units. In 1990, these data are shown for all housing units.    SECOND OR JUNIOR MORTGAGE PAYMENT    The data on second or junior mortgage payments were obtained from questionnaire items H24a and H24b, which were asked at owner-occupied one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. Question H24a asks whether a second or junior mortgage or a home equity loan exists on the property. Question H24b provides the regular monthly amount required to be paid to the lender on all second or junior mortgages and home equity loans. Amounts are included even if the payments are delinquent or paid by someone else. The amounts reported are included in the computation of ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs"" and ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989"" for units with a mortgage.   All mortgages other than first mortgages are classified as ""junior"" mortgages. A second mortgage is a junior mortgage that gives the lender a claim against the property that is second to the claim of the holder of the first mortgage. Any other junior mortgage(s) would be subordinate to the second mortgage. A home equity loan is a line of credit available to the borrower that is secured by real estate. It may be placed on a property that already has a first or second mortgage, or it may be placed on a property that is owned free and clear.   If the respondents answered that no first mortgage existed, but a second mortgage did (as in the above case with a home equity loan), a computer edit assigned the unit a first mortgage and made the first mortgage monthly payment the amount reported in the second mortgage. The second mortgage data were then made ""No"" in question H24a and blank in question H24b.   Comparability--The 1980 census obtained total regular monthly mortgage payments, including payments on second or junior mortgages, from one single question. Two questions were used in 1990: one for regular monthly payments on first mortgages, and one for regular monthly payments on second or junior mortgages and home equity loans.    SELECTED MONTHLY OWNER COSTS    The data on selected monthly owner costs were obtained from questionnaire items H20 through H26 for a sample of owner-occupied one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. Selected monthly owner costs is the sum of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property (including payments for the first mortgage, second or junior mortgages, and home equity loans); real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the property; utilities (electricity, gas, and water); and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.). It also includes, where appropriate, the monthly condominium fee for condominiums and mobile home costs (personal property taxes, site rent, registration fees, and license fees) for mobile homes.   In certain tabulations, selected monthly owner costs are presented separately for specified owner-occupied housing units (owner-occupied one-family houses on fewer than 10 acres without a business or medical office on the property), owner-occupied condominiums, and owner-occupied mobile homes. Data usually are shown separately for units ""with a mortgage"" and for units ""not mortgaged.""   Median Selected Monthly Owner Costs--This measure is rounded to the nearest whole dollar.   Comparability--The components of selected monthly owner costs were collected for the first time in 1980. The 1990 tabulations of selected monthly owner costs for specified owner-occupied housing units are virtually identical to 1980, the primary difference was the amounts of the first and second mortgages were collected in separate questions in 1990, while the amounts were collected in a single question in 1980. The component parts of the item were tabulated for mobile homes and condominiums for the first time in 1990.   In 1980, costs for electricity and gas were collected as average monthly costs. In 1990, all utility and fuel costs were collected as yearly costs and divided by 12 to provide an average monthly cost.    SELECTED MONTHLY OWNER COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN  1989    The information on selected monthly owner costs as a percentage of household income in 1989 is the computed ratio of selected monthly owner costs to monthly household income in 1989. The ratio was computed separately for each unit and rounded to the nearest whole percentage. The data are tabulated separately for specified owner- occupied units, condominiums, and mobile homes.   Separate distributions are often shown for units ""with a mortgage"" and for units ""not mortgaged."" Units occupied by households reporting no income or a net loss in 1989 are included in the ""not computed"" category. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs."")   Comparability--The components of selected monthly owner costs were collected for the first time in 1980. The tabulations of ""Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989"" for specified owner-occupied housing units are comparable to 1980.    SEWAGE DISPOSAL    The data on sewage disposal were obtained from questionnaire item H16, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. This item was asked on a sample basis. Housing units are either connected to a public sewer, to a septic tank or cesspool, or they dispose of sewage by other means. A public sewer may be operated by a government body or by a private organization. A housing unit is considered to be connected to a septic tank or cesspool when the unit is provided with an underground pit or tank for sewage disposal. The category, ""Other means"" includes housing units which dispose of sewage in some other way.   Comparability--Data on sewage disposal have been collected since 1940. In 1970 and 1980, data were shown only for year-round housing units. In 1990, data are shown for all housing units.    SOURCE OF WATER    The data on source of water were obtained from questionnaire item H15, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. Housing units may receive their water supply from a number of sources. A common source supplying water to five or more units is classified as a ""Public system or private company."" The water may be supplied by a city, county, water district, water company, etc., or it may be obtained from a well which supplies water to five or more housing units. If the water is supplied from a well serving four or fewer housing units, the units are classified as having water supplied by either an ""Individual drilled well"" or an ""Individual dug well."" Drilled wells or small diameter wells are usually less than 1-1/2 feet in diameter. Dug wells are usually larger than 1-1/2 feet wide and generally hand dug. The category, ""Some other source"" includes water obtained from springs, creeks, rivers, lakes, cisterns, etc.   Comparability--Data on source of water have been collected since 1940. In 1970 and 1980, data were shown only for year-round housing units. In 1990, data are shown for all housing units.    TELEPHONE IN HOUSING UNIT    The data on telephones were obtained from questionnaire item H12, which was asked at occupied housing units. This item was asked on a sample basis. A telephone must be inside the house or apartment for the unit to be classified as having a telephone. Units where the respondent uses a telephone located inside the building but not in the respondent's living quarters are classified as having no telephone.   Comparability--Data on telephones in 1980 are comparable to 1990. The 1960 and 1970 censuses collected data on telephone availability. A unit was classified as having a telephone available if there was a telephone number on which occupants of the unit could be reached. The telephone could have been in another unit, in a common hall, or outside the building.    TENURE    The data for tenure were obtained from questionnaire item H4, which was asked at all occupied housing units. All occupied housing units are classified as either owner occupied or renter occupied.   Owner Occupied--A housing unit is owner occupied if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. The owner or co-owner must live in the unit and usually is the person listed in column 1 of the questionnaire. The unit is ""Owned by you or someone in this household with a mortgage or loan"" if it is being purchased with a mortgage or some other debt arrangement such as a deed of trust, trust deed, contract to purchase, land contract, or purchase agreement. The unit is also considered owned with a mortgage if it is built on leased land and there is a mortgage on the unit.   A housing unit is ""Owned by you or someone in this household free and clear (without a mortgage)"" if there is no mortgage or other similar debt on the house, apartment, or mobile home including units built on leased land if the unit is owned outright without a mortgage. Although owner-occupied units are divided between mortgaged and owned free and clear on the questionnaire, census data products containing 100-percent data show only total owner-occupied counts. More extensive mortgage information was collected on the long-form questionnaire and are shown in census products containing sample data. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Mortgage Status."")   Renter Occupied--All occupied housing units which are not owner occupied, whether they are rented for cash rent or occupied without payment of cash rent, are classified as renter occupied. ""No cash rent"" units are separately identified in the rent tabulations. Such units are generally provided free by friends or relatives or in exchange for services such as resident manager, caretaker, minister, or tenant farmer. Housing units on military bases also are classified in the ""No cash rent"" category. ""Rented for cash rent"" includes units in continuing care, sometimes called life care arrangements. These arrangements usually involve a contract between one or more individuals and a health services provider guaranteeing the individual shelter, usually a house or apartment, and services, such as meals or transportation to shopping or recreation.   Comparability--Data on tenure have been collected since 1890. In 1970, the question on tenure also included a category for condominium and cooperative ownership. In 1980, condominium units and cooperatives were dropped from the tenure item, and since 1980, only condominium units are identified in a separate question.   For 1990, the response categories were expanded to allow the respondent to report whether the unit was owned with a mortgage or free and clear (without a mortgage). The distinction between units owned with a mortgage and units owned free and clear was added in 1990 to improve the count of owner-occupied units. Research after the 1980 census indicated some respondents did not consider their units owned if they had a mortgage.    UNITS IN STRUCTURE    The data on units in structure (also referred to as ""type of structure"") were obtained from questionnaire item H2, which was asked at all housing units. A structure is a separate building that either has open spaces on all sides or is separated from other structures by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the number of units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and vacant, are counted. Stores and office space are excluded.   The statistics are presented for the number of housing units in structures of specified type and size, not for the number of residential buildings.   1-Unit, Detached--This is a 1-unit structure detached from any other house; that is, with open space on all four sides. Such structures are considered detached even if they have an adjoining shed or garage. A one-family house that contains a business is considered detached as long as the building has open space on all four sides. Mobile homes or trailers to which one or more permanent rooms have been added or built also are included.   1-Unit, Attached--This is a 1-unit structure that has one or more walls extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. In row houses (sometimes called townhouses), double houses, or houses attached to nonresidential structures, each house is a separate, attached structure if the dividing or common wall goes from ground to roof.   2 or More Units--These are units in structures containing 2 or more housing units, further categorized as units in structures with 2, 3 or 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, and 50 or more units.   Mobile Home or Trailer--Both occupied and vacant mobile homes to which no permanent rooms have been added are counted in this category. Mobile homes or trailers used only for business purposes or for extra sleeping space and mobile homes or trailers for sale on a dealer's lot, at the factory, or in storage are not counted in the housing inventory.   Other--This category is for any living quarters occupied as a housing unit that does not fit the previous categories. Examples that fit this category are houseboats, railroad cars, campers, and vans.   Comparability--Data on units in structure have been collected since 1940 and on mobile homes and trailers since 1950. In 1970 and 1980, these data were shown only for year-round housing units. In 1990, these data are shown for all housing units. In 1980, the data were collected on a sample basis. The category, ""Boat, tent, van, etc."" was replaced in 1990 by the category ""Other."" In some areas, the proportion of units classified as ""Other"" is far larger than the number of units that were classified as ""Boat, tent, van, etc."" in 1980.    USUAL HOME ELSEWHERE    The data for usual home elsewhere are obtained from questionnaire item B, which was completed by census employees. A housing unit temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration entirely by persons with a usual residence elsewhere is classified"

Telephone:  202-395-3093.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:          A.  Background              The current standards were developed in cooperation with the Federal agencies to      provide consistent and comparable data on race and ethnicity throughout the Federal      government for an array of statistical and administrative programs.  Development of the      data standards stemmed in large measure from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights      laws.  Data were needed to monitor equal access to housing, education, employment      opportunities, etc., for population groups that historically had experienced discrimination      and differential treatment because of their race or ethnicity.  The categories that were      developed represent a political-social construct designed to be used in the collection of       data on the race and ethnicity of major broad population groups in this country, and are      not anthropologically or scientifically based.  The standards are used not only in the      decennial census (which provides the ""denominator"" for many measures), but also in      household surveys, on administrative forms (e.g., school registration and mortgage      lending applications), and in medical and other research.             The standards provide a minimum set of categories for data on race and ethnicity.         The current standards have four categories for data on race (American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, and White) and two categories for data on ethnicity (""Hispanic origin"" and ""Not of Hispanic origin"").  The standards also permit the collection of more detailed information on population groups provided that any additional  categories can be aggregated into the minimum standard set of categories. Self-identification is the preferred means of obtaining information about an individual's race and ethnicity, except in instances where observer identification is more practical (e.g., completing a death certificate).             The categories in Directive No. 15 do not identify or designate certain population groups as ""minority groups.""  As the Directive explicitly states, these categories are not to be used for determining the eligibility of population groups for participation in any Federal programs.   Directive No. 15 does not establish criteria or qualifications (such as blood quantum levels) that are to be used in determining a particular individual's racial or ethnic classification.  Directive No. 15 does not tell an individual who he or she is, or specify how an individual should classify himself or herself.         B.  Review Process              Particularly since the 1990 census, the standards have come under  increasing criticism from those who believe that the minimum categories set  forth in Directive No. 15 do not reflect the increasing diversity of our Nation's  population that has resulted primarily from growth in immigration and in  interracial marriages.  In response to the criticisms, OMB announced in July  1993 that it would undertake a comprehensive review of the current categories  for data on race and ethnicity.              This review has been conducted over the last four years in collaboration  with the Interagency Committee for the Review of the Racial and Ethnic Standards,  which OMB established in March 1994 to facilitate the participation of Federal agencies  in the review.    The members of the Interagency Committee, from more than 30 agencies, represent the many and diverse Federal needs for data on race and ethnicity, including statutory requirements for such data.             The principal objective of the review is to enhance the accuracy of the demographic information collected by the Federal Government.  The starting point for the review was the current minimum set of categories for data on race and ethnicity that have provided 20 years of information for a variety of purposes, and the recognition of the importance of being able to maintain this historical continuity.  The review process has had two major elements:  (1) public comment on the present standards, which helped to identify concerns and provided numerous suggestions for changing the standards; and (2) research and testing related to assessing the possible effects of suggested changes on the  quality and usefulness of the resulting data.   Public input, the first element of the review process, was sought through a variety of means:  (1) During 1993, Congressman Thomas C. Sawyer, then Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Census, Statistics, and Postal Personnel, held four hearings that included 27 witnesses, focusing  particularly on the use of the categories in the 2000 census.  (2) At the request of OMB, the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) conducted a workshop in February 1994 to articulate  issues surrounding a review of the categories.  The workshop included representatives of Federal agencies, academia, social science research institutions, interest groups, private industry, and a local school  district.  (A summary of the workshop,  Spotlight on Heterogeneity: The Federal Standards for Racial and Ethnic Classification , is available  from CNSTAT, 2101 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20418.)   (3) On June 9, 1994, OMB published a  Federal Register  (59 FR  29831-29835) Notice that contained background information on the development of the current standards and requested public comment on:  the adequacy of current racial and ethnic categories;  the principles that should govern any proposed revisions to the standards; and specific suggestions for change that had been offered by individuals and interested groups over the past several years.  In response, OMB received nearly 800 letters.  As part of this comment period and to bring the review closer to the public, OMB also heard testimony from 94 witnesses at hearings held during July 1994 in Boston, Denver, San Francisco, and Honolulu.  (4) In an August 28, 1995,  Federal Register  (60 FR 44674-44693)  Notice, OMB provided an interim report on the review process, including a summary of the comments on the June 1994  Federal Register  Notice, and offered a final opportunity for comment on the research to be conducted during 1996.  (5) OMB staff have also made themselves available to discuss the review process with various interested groups and have made presentations at many meetings.   The second element of the review process involved research and testing of various proposed changes.  The categories in OMB's Directive No. 15 are used not only to produce data on the demographic characteristics of the population, but also for civil rights enforcement and program administration.  Research would enable an objective assessment of the data quality issues associated with various approaches to collecting data  on race and ethnicity.   For that reason, the Interagency Committee's Research Working Group on Racial and Ethnic Standards, which is co-chaired by the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, reviewed the various criticisms and suggestions for changing the current categories, and developed a research agenda for some of the more significant issues that had been identified.  These issues included collecting and classifying data on persons who identify themselves as ""multiracial""; combining race and Hispanic origin in one question or having separate questions on race and Hispanic origin; combining the concepts of race, ethnicity, and ancestry; changing the terminology used for particular categories; and adding new categories to the current minimum set.   Because the mode of data collection can have an effect on how a person responds, the research agenda addressed the issue of how an individual responds when an interviewer collects the information (in an in-person interview or a telephone interview) versus how an individual responds in a self-administered situation, such as in the decennial census when a form is filled out and mailed back.  In addition, cognitive research interviews were conducted with various groups to provide guidance on the wording of the questions and the instructions.    The research agenda included several major national tests during the last two years, the results of which are discussed throughout the Interagency Committee's report:    (1)  In May 1995, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) sponsored a  Supplement on Race and Ethnicity to the Current Population Survey (CPS).   The findings were made available in a 1996 report,  Testing Methods of  Collecting Racial and Ethnic Information: Results of the Current  Population Survey Supplement on Race and Ethnicity , available from BLS,  2 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Room 4915, Postal Square Building,  Washington, D.C. 20212,  by calling 202-606-7375.  The results were also  summarized in an October 26, 1995, news release, which is available  electronically at http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ethnic.toc.htm.   (2)  The Bureau of the Census, as part of its research for the 2000 census, tested alternative approaches to collecting data on race and ethnicity in the March 1996 National Content Survey (NCS).  The Census  Bureau published the results in a December 1996 report, Findings on Questions on Race and Hispanic Origin Tested in the 1996 National Content Survey; highlights of the report are available at http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/96natcontentsurvey.html.   (3) In June 1996, the Census Bureau conducted the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test (RAETT), which was designed to permit assessments of effects of possible changes on smaller populations not reliably measured in national samples, including American Indians, Alaska Natives, detailed Asian and Pacific Islander groups (such as Chinese and Hawaiians) and detailed Hispanic groups (such as Puerto Ricans and Cubans).   The Census Bureau released the results in a May 1997 report,  Results of the 1996 Race and Ethnic Targeted Test ; highlights of the report are available at http://www/census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps-0018.html. Single copies (paper) of the NCS and RAETT reports may be obtained from the Population Division, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233; telephone 301-457-2402.   In addition to these three major tests, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education jointly conducted a survey of 1,000 public schools to determine how schools collect data on the race and ethnicity of their students and how the administrative records containing these data are maintained to meet statutory requirements for reporting aggregate information to the Federal Government.  NCES published the results in a March 1996 report,  Racial and Ethnic Classifications Used by Public Schools .  The report is available electronically at http://www.ed.gov/NCES/pubs/98092.html.  Single paper copies may be obtained from NCES, 555 New Jersey, NW, Washington, D.C. 20208-5574, or by calling 202-219-1442.   The research agenda also included studies conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to evaluate the procedures used and the quality of the information in administrative records on race and ethnicity such as that reported on birth certificates and recorded on death certificates.  Since these data are used in studies of diseases and of the health and well-being of major population groups, these studies investigated possible impacts of suggested changes on data needed for medical and health research.    C.  Overview of Interagency Committee Report    This  Federal Register  Notice makes available for comment the  Interagency Committee's recommendations for how OMB should revise  Directive No. 15.  These recommendations are elaborated in the  Interagency Committee's  Report to the Office of Management and Budget  on the Review of Statistical Policy Directive No. 15  which is published  in its entirety as part of this Notice.  The report consists of six  chapters.  Chapter 1 provides a brief history of Directive No. 15, a  summary of the issues considered by the Interagency Committee, a review  of the research activities, and a discussion of the criteria used in  conducting the evaluation.  Chapter 2 discusses a number of general  concerns that need to be addressed when considering any changes to the  current standards.  Chapters 3 through 5 report the results of the  research as they bear on the more significant suggestions OMB received  for changes to Directive No. 15.    Chapter 6 gives the Interagency's Committee's recommendations concerning the various suggested changes based on a review of public comments and testimony and the research results.    This Notice affords a final opportunity for the public to comment before OMB acts on the recommendations of the Interagency Committee.  None of the recommendations has been adopted and no interim decisions have been made concerning them.  OMB can modify or reject any of the recommendations, and OMB has the option of making no changes.  The report and its recommendations are published in this Notice because OMB believes that they are worthy of public discussion and that OMB's decision will benefit  from obtaining the public's views on the recommendations.   OMB will  announce its decision in mid-October 1997, so that changes,  if any ,  can be incorporated into the questions for the 2000 census ""dress rehearsal,"" which will be conducted in spring 1998.    ISSUES FOR COMMENT:  With this Notice, OMB requests comments on the  recommendations it has received from the Interagency Committee for the Review of the Racial and Ethnic Standards concerning the revision of Statistical Policy Directive No. 15.  These recommendations are contained in Chapter 6 of the Interagency Committee's report.   The complete report is included in this Notice because Chapters 1 through 5 provide both a context and the bases for the Interagency Committee's recommendations outlined in Chapter 6.  As an aid in evaluating the recommendations, readers may wish to refer to the set of general principles (see Chapter 1) that were developed at the beginning of the Directive No. 15 review to govern the process -- a process that has attempted to balance statistical issues, needs for data, social concerns, and the personal dimensions of racial and ethnic identification.  The committee recognized that these principles may in some cases represent competing goals for the standard.  For example, having categories that are comprehensive in the coverage of our Nation's diverse population (Principle 4) and that would facilitate self-identification (Principle 2) may not be operationally feasible in terms of the burden that would be placed upon respondents and the public and private costs that would be associated with implementation (Principle 8).   The following are just a few examples of questions that might be considered in assessing the recommendations using the general principles:       Do the recommendations provide categories for classifying data on race and ethnicity that are:  generally understood and accepted by the public (Principle 3); comprehensive in coverage (Principle 4); and useful for statistical analysis, and for Federal statutory and programmatic requirements (Principles 5 and 6)?    Are the recommendations based on sound methodological research (Principle 9)?  Do the recommendations take into account continuity of historical data series (Principle 10)?       As reflected in the general principles, the goal has been to produce a standard that would result in consistent, publicly accepted data on race and ethnicity which will meet the needs of the Federal Government and the public, while recognizing the diversity of the population and respecting the individual's dignity.  We would appreciate receiving your views and comments on any aspects of the Interagency Committee's recommendations, as well as on the extent to which the recommendations were successful in meeting the goals of the governing principles.        _______________________  Sally Katzen   Administrator ,  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs                                    APPENDIX 1                        DIRECTIVE NO. 15        RACE AND ETHNIC STANDARDS FOR FEDERAL STATISTICS                   AND ADMINISTRATIVE REPORTING                   (as adopted on May 12, 1977)              This Directive provides standard classifications for record keeping, collection, and      presentation of data on race and ethnicity in Federal program administrative reporting and      statistical activities.  These classifications should not be interpreted as being scientific or      anthropological in nature, nor should they be viewed as determinants of eligibility for      participation in any Federal program.  They have been developed in response to needs      expressed by both the executive branch and the Congress to provide for the collection and      use of compatible, nonduplicated, exchangeable racial and ethnic data by Federal      agencies.         1.  Definitions              The basic racial and ethnic categories for Federal statistics and program      administrative reporting are defined as follows:      American Indian or Alaskan Native .  A person having  origins in any of the original peoples of North America, and who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition.    Asian or Pacific Islander .  A person having origins in  any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands.  This area includes, for example, China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands, and Samoa.    Black .  A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.     Hispanic .  A person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban,  Central or South American or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless  of race.     White .  A person having origins in any of the original  peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.           2.  Utilization for Record keeping and Reporting               To provide flexibility, it is preferable to collect data on race and ethnicity      separately.  If separate race and ethnic categories are used, the minimum designations are:      Race :            -- American Indian or Alaskan Native            --Asian or Pacific Islander            --Black            --White    Ethnicity :            --Hispanic origin            --Not of Hispanic origin          When race and ethnicity are collected separately, the number of White and Black persons      who are Hispanic must be identifiable, and capable of being reported in that category.               If a combined format is used to collect racial and ethnic data, the minimum      acceptable categories are:               --American Indian or Alaskan Native            --Asian or Pacific Islander            --Black, not of Hispanic origin            --Hispanic            --White, not of Hispanic origin.               The category which most closely reflects the individual's recognition in his      community should be used for purposes of reporting on persons who are of mixed racial      and/or ethnic origins.             In no case should the provisions of this Directive be construed to limit the      collection of data to the categories described above.  However, any reporting required      which uses more detail shall be organized in such a way that the additional categories can      be aggregated into these basic racial/ethnic categories.               The minimum standard collection categories shall be utilized for reporting as      follows:      Civil rights compliance reporting .  The categories specified above will be used by all agencies in either the separate or combined format for civil rights compliance reporting and equal employment reporting for both the public and private sectors and for all levels of government.  Any variation requiring less detailed data or data which cannot be aggregated into the basic categories will have to be specifically approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for executive agencies.  More detailed reporting which can be aggregated to the basic categories may be used at the agencies' discretion.    General program administrative and grant reporting .  Whenever an agency subject to this Directive issues new or revised administrative reporting or record keeping requirements which include racial or ethnic data, the agency will use the race/ethnic categories described above.  A variance can be specifically requested from OMB, but such a variance will be granted only if the agency can demonstrate that it is not reasonable for the primary reporter to determine the racial or ethnic background in terms of the specified categories, and that such determination is not critical to the administration of the program in question, or if the specific program is directed to only one or a limited number of race/ethnic groups, e.g., Indian tribal activities.    Statistical reporting .  The categories described in this Directive will be used at a minimum for federally sponsored statistical data collection where race and/or ethnicity is required, except when: the collection involves a sample of such size that the data on the smaller categories would be unreliable, or when the collection effort focuses on a specific racial or ethnic group.  A repetitive survey shall be deemed to have an adequate sample size if the racial and ethnic data can be reliably aggregated on a biennial basis.  Any other variation will have to be specifically authorized by OMB through the reports clearance process.  In those cases where the data collection is not subject to the reports clearance process, a direct request for a variance should be made to OMB.           3.  Effective Date              The provisions of this Directive are effective immediately for  all  new  and  revised       record keeping or reporting requirements containing racial and/or ethnic information.  All      existing record keeping or reporting requirements shall be made consistent with this      Directive at the time they are submitted for extension, or not later than January 1, 1980.         4.  Presentation of Race/Ethnic Data              Displays of racial and ethnic compliance and statistical data will use the category      designations listed above.  The designation ""nonwhite"" is not acceptable for use in the      presentation of Federal Government data.  It is not to be used in any publication of      compliance or statistical data or in the text of any compliance or statistical report.             In cases where the above designations are considered inappropriate for      presentation of statistical data on particular programs or for particular regional areas, the      sponsoring agency may use:             (1) The designations ""Black and Other Races"" or ""All Other Races,"" as collective      descriptions of minority races when the most summary distinction between the majority      and minority races is appropriate;             (2) The designations ""White,"" ""Black,""and ""All Other Races"" when the distinction      among the majority race, the principal minority race and other races is appropriate; or             (3) The designation of a particular minority race or races, and the inclusion of      ""Whites"" with ""All Other Races,"" if such a collective description is appropriate.             In displaying detailed information which represents a combination of race and      ethnicity, the description of the data being displayed must clearly indicate that both bases      of classification are being used.               When the primary focus of a statistical report is on two or more specific      identifiable groups in the population, one or more of which is racial or ethnic, it is      acceptable to display data for each of the particular groups separately and to describe data           relating to the remainder of the population by an appropriate collective description.                                 APPENDIX 2           REPORT TO THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET                        ON THE REVIEW OF               STATISTICAL POLICY DIRECTIVE NO. 15                           Prepared  By           Interagency Committee for the Review of the                   Racial and Ethnic Standards       (Transmittal Memorandum)                     May 28, 1997       MEMORANDUM FOR KATHERINE K. WALLMAN                                               Chief Statistician                                               Office of Management  and Budget        FROM:                           Interagency Committee for the Review of the Racial and Ethnic                                                 Standards        SUBJECT:           Transmittal of Report and Recommendations on the Review of                                                  Directive No. 15             We are pleased to transmit to you the attached report that provides the      recommendations of the Interagency Committee for the Review of the Racial and Ethnic      Standards for modifying OMB's Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, Race and Ethnic      Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting.  These recommendations,      which are outlined in Chapter 6 of the report, represent our best technical and      professional advice for how these data standards could better reflect the increasing racial      and ethnic diversity of our Nation's population, while maintaining historical continuity.               Our recommendations for Directive No. 15 are the product of a three-year review      process that is briefly described in Chapter 1 of the report.  During that time, we      developed and carried out a  research program to evaluate various proposals for revising      the standards.  Chapter 2 discusses some general concerns relevant to consideration of      any changes in the standards.  Chapters 3 through 5 report on the extensive research      efforts, including three national tests, that have been conducted to test alternative      approaches for questions to collect data on race and ethnicity.  The Interagency      Committee's recommendations, presented in Chapter 6, are based on our evaluation of the      research results and consideration of related public comments and testimony.             We hope that the Office of Management and Budget will find this report with its      accompanying recommendations informative and helpful in making its decision on what      changes to adopt, if any, in the Federal standards for reporting  data on race and ethnicity.

Introduction        1.1 Overview             This report evaluates a variety of proposals for modifying the Office of      Management and Budget's (OMB) Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, ""Race and Ethnic      Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting.""  The Directive sets forth a      minimum set of categories for collecting and presenting data on race and Hispanic origin.       This basic set of categories has served as the guideline for Federal Government data      collections since it was issued in May 1977.  The report presented here, including its      recommendations, is the culmination of three years of research undertaken by Federal      agencies to evaluate the possible impact of suggested changes on the quality and cost of      the resulting data.  It is the work of the Interagency Committee for the Review of the      Racial and Ethnic Standards and its Research Working Group on Racial and Ethnic      Standards.  OMB established the Interagency Committee in 1994 to evaluate various      proposed changes and provide recommendations.  The committee created the Research      Working Group to develop and carry out a research agenda for evaluating the proposals.             The report consists of six chapters.  This first chapter provides a brief history of      Directive No. 15, a summary of the issues considered by the Interagency Committee, a      review of the research activities over the past three years, and a discussion of the criteria      used in conducting the evaluation.  Chapter 2 discusses several general concerns that need      to be addressed when considering any changes to the current standards.  Chapters 3      through 5 report the research results as they bear on the more significant  suggestions for      changes to Directive No. 15.  These suggestions include, but are not limited to, permitting      respondents to report multiple racial backgrounds, a single question on race and ethnicity      that would include Hispanic as a category, expanding  the minimum set of categories to      include other specific ethnic or racial groups, and adding to, or replacing the names of      categories used to identify specific racial or ethnic groups.  Chapter 6 presents the      committee's recommendations on various suggested changes based on its evaluation of      the research results and consideration of related public comments and testimony.         1.2  History of Directive No. 15              The United States Government has long collected statistics on race and ethnicity.       Such data have been used to monitor changes in the social, demographic, health, and      economic characteristics of various groups in our population.  Federal data collections,      through censuses, surveys, and administrative records, have provided an historical record      of the Nation's  population diversity and its changing social attitudes, health status, and      policy concerns.             Since the 1960s, data on race and ethnicity have been used extensively in      monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws covering areas such as education, employment,      housing and mortgage lending, health care, voting rights, and the administration of      justice.   These legislatively based priorities created the need among Federal agencies for      compatible, nonduplicative data for population groups that historically had suffered      discrimination on the basis of their race or ethnicity.  In response, OMB issued, in 1977,      the current set of categories for use in the collection and presentation of data on race and      ethnicity. The categories also implemented the requirements of Public Law 94-311 of      June 16, 1976, which called for the collection, analysis, and publication of economic and      social statistics on persons of Spanish origin or descent.               The current standard provides that, if racial and ethnic data are collected      separately, the minimum racial categories are:               -- American Indian or Alaskan Native .  A person having  origins in any of the      original peoples of North America, and who maintains cultural identification through      tribal affiliation or community recognition.             -- Asian or Pacific Islander .  A person having origins in  any of the original peoples      of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands.  This area      includes, for example, China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands, and Samoa.             -- Black .  A person having origins in any of the black  racial groups of Africa.              -- White .  A person having origins in any of the original  peoples of Europe, North      Africa, or the Middle East.          For ethnicity, the categories are:               -- Hispanic origin .  A person of Mexican, Puerto Rican,  Cuban, Central or South         American or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.             --  Not of Hispanic origin .  A person not of any Spanish  culture or origin.      When a combined format is used, the minimum categories are: (1) American Indian or      Alaskan Native; (2) Asian or Pacific Islander; (3) Black, not of Hispanic origin; (4)      Hispanic; and (5) White, not of Hispanic origin.               The current categories originated in the work of the Federal Interagency      Committee on Education (FICE) whose membership represented some 30 Federal      agencies.  In June 1974, FICE created an Ad Hoc Committee on Racial and Ethnic      Definitions, whose 25 members came from Federal agencies with major responsibilities      for the collection or use of data on race and ethnicity.  This ad hoc committee was      charged with developing terms and definitions for a broad range of data on race and      ethnicity to be collected by Federal agencies on a compatible and nonduplicative basis.       The committee sought to ensure that the categories could be aggregated, disaggregated, or      otherwise combined so that the data developed by one agency could be used in      conjunction with the data developed by another agency.  The committee also suggested      that the basic categories could be subdivided into more detailed ethnic subgroups to meet      users' needs, but that to maintain comparability, data from one major category should      never be combined with data from any other category.             In the spring of 1975, FICE completed its work on a draft set of categories.  An      agreement was reached among OMB, the General Accounting Office (GAO), the      Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's (HEW) Office for Civil Rights, and the      Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to adopt these categories for a trial      period of at least one year.  This trial was undertaken to test the new categories and      definitions and to determine what problems, if any, would be encountered in their      implementation.               At the end of the test period, OMB and GAO convened an Ad Hoc Committee on      Racial/Ethnic Categories to review the experience of the agencies that had implemented      the standard categories and definitions and to discuss any potential problems that might      be encountered in extending the use of the categories to all Federal agencies.   The      Committee met in August 1976 and included representatives of OMB; GAO; the      Departments of Justice, Labor, HEW, and Housing and Urban Development; the Bureau      of the Census; and the EEOC.  Based upon the discussion in that meeting, OMB prepared      minor revisions to the FICE definitions and circulated the proposed final draft for agency      comment.  These revised categories and definitions became effective in September 1976      for all compliance record keeping and reporting required by the Federal agencies      represented on the Ad Hoc Committee.               Based upon this interagency agreement, OMB drafted for agency comment a      proposed revision of the ""race and color designations in Federal statistics"" contained in its      circular on Standards and Guidelines for Federal Statistics.  Some agencies published the      draft revision for public comment.  Following receipt of comments and incorporation of      suggested modifications,  OMB, on May 12, 1977, promulgated the racial and ethnic      categories now set forth in Directive No. 15.  Thus, for the first time, standard categories      and definitions were to be used by all Federal agencies in both the collection and the       presentation of data on race and ethnicity.  The categories and definitions were developed      primarily on the basis of  geography; therefore, they were not to be interpreted as being      scientific or anthropological in nature.  The racial and ethnic categories in the Directive      reflected, in particular, agency needs for data for use in monitoring and enforcing civil      rights laws.             Although the standards given in Directive No. 15 have not been revised since      1977, OMB did publish in the January 20, 1988,  Federal  Register  a draft Statistical      Policy Circular soliciting public comment on a comprehensive revision of existing      Statistical Policy Directives.  Among the proposed changes was a revision of Directive      No. 15 that would have added  an ""Other"" racial category and required classification by      self-identification.  This proposal was supported by many multiracial and multiethnic      groups and some educational institutions, but it drew strong opposition from large      corporations and Federal agencies such as the Civil Rights Division of the Department of      Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, the EEOC, and the Office of      Personnel Management (OPM).  Critics asserted that the present system provided      adequate data, that any changes would disrupt historical continuity, and that the proposed      changes would be expensive and potentially divisive.  Some members of minority      communities interpreted the proposal as an attempt to provoke internal dissension within      their communities and to reduce the official counts of their populations.  Because it was      evident from all of these comments that this proposal would not be widely accepted, no      changes were made to Directive No. 15.         1.3  Concerns About the Current Standards              The population of the United States has become increasingly diverse during the      20 years that the current standards have been in effect.  During the 1980s, immigration to      the United States from Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Asia      reached historic proportions.  The 1990 census data show that the population of the      United States is more racially and ethnically diverse than ever.  Furthermore, as a result      of the growth in interracial marriages, there is an increase in the number of persons born      who are of mixed race or ethnicity.  In recent years, Directive No. 15 has been criticized      for not sufficiently reflecting this growing diversity.               In addition, there have been a number of other concerns expressed.  For example:                --The categories and their definitions have been criticized as failing to be      comprehensive and scientific.               --Some have suggested that the geographic orientation of the definitions for the      various racial and ethnic categories is not sufficiently definitive.  They believe that there      is no readily apparent organizing principle for making such distinctions and that      definitions for the categories should be eliminated.               --Others maintain that the identification of an individual's racial and ethnic      ""category"" often is a subjective determination, rather than one that is objective and      factual.  Thus, they believe that it may no longer be appropriate to consider the categories      as a ""statistical standard.""              --There is disagreement over the use of self-identification versus observer      identification.               --Some critics have said that the two formats permitted by Directive No. 15 are      not compatible.  They argue that, when using the two separate questions, race and      Hispanic origin can be kept analytically distinct, but in the combined race/ethnicity      format, they cannot.  While many find the combined format particularly suitable for      observer identification, the use of this format does not provide information on the race of      those selecting it.  As a result, the combined format makes it impossible to distribute      persons of Hispanic origin by race and, therefore, may reduce the utility of counts in the      four racial categories by excluding from them persons who would otherwise tend to be      included.             --Certain critics have requested an open-ended question to solicit information on      race and ethnicity that would combine the concepts of race, ethnicity, and ancestry.               --The importance of maintaining comparability over time also has also been      questioned, given that the categories have changed in the decennial censuses over the      decades.              --Some have said that the collection categories should allow for capturing greater      diversity, but that the categories used to present data should be aggregations of the more      detailed categories.               --Others assert that the collection of data on race and ethnicity should be      eliminated because it perpetuates racism and the fragmentation of society.               The following are some of the suggestions for changes to the current categories      that OMB received during the current review process:               --Add a ""multiracial"" category to the list of racial designations so that respondents      would not be forced to deny part of their heritage by having to choose a single category.             --Add an ""other"" category for individuals of multiracial heritage and for those      who want the option of specifically stating a unique identification.             --Change the name of the ""Black"" category to ""African American.""             --Change the name of the ""American Indian or Alaskan Native"" category to      ""Native American.""             --Since race and ethnicity are not distinct concepts, include Hispanic as a racial      category, rather than as a separate ethnic category.             --Add a ""Middle Eastern"" or ""Arab"" ethnic category.             --Add a ""Cape Verdean"" ethnic category.             --Make ""Native Hawaiians"" a separate category or include ""Native Hawaiians"" in      the American Indian or Alaskan Native category, rather than retain ""Native Hawaiians"" in      the Asian or Pacific Islander category.             --Change the name of the ""Hispanic"" category to ""Latino.""               During 1993, Thomas C. Sawyer, then Chairman of the House of Representatives'      Subcommittee on Census, Statistics, and Postal Personnel, held four hearings on the      measurement of race and ethnicity in the decennial census.  In testimony on July 29,      1993, OMB announced that it would undertake a comprehensive review of the categories,      including an analysis of the possible effects of any proposed changes to the categories on      the quality and utility of the resulting data that are used for a multiplicity of purposes.               As a first step, OMB asked the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) of      the National Academy of Sciences to convene a workshop to provide an informed      discussion of the issues surrounding a review of the categories.  The workshop, held on      February 17-18, 1994, included representatives of Federal agencies, academia, social      science research institutions, interest groups, private industry, and a local school district.         1.4 Principles for the Review Process              In March 1994, OMB established and held the first meeting of the Interagency      Committee for the Review of the Racial and Ethnic Standards, whose members from      more than 30 agencies represent the many and diverse Federal needs for data on race and      ethnicity, including statutory requirements for such data.  Given the range of suggestions      and criticisms concerning Directive No. 15, OMB sought in constituting the committee to      have all agency stakeholders participate in this comprehensive review of the standards.       Agencies represented on the Interagency Committee included:              Department of Agriculture            National Agricultural Statistics Service            Economic Research Service       Department of Commerce             Bureau of the Census       Department of Defense            Defense Manpower Data Center            Office of the Secretary       Department of Education            National Center for Education Statistics            Office for Civil Rights       Department of Health and Human Services            Administration for Native Americans            Agency for Health Care Policy and Research            Centers for Disease Control and Prevention            Indian Health Service            National Center for Health Statistics            National Institutes of Health            Office for Civil Rights            Office of Minority Health            Office of Refugee Resettlement        Department of Housing and Urban Development        Department of the Interior            Bureau of Indian Affairs        Department of Justice            Bureau of Justice Statistics            Civil Rights Division            Immigration and Naturalization Service       Department of Labor            Bureau of Labor Statistics            Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs       Department of Transportation            Bureau of Transportation Statistics       Department of Veterans Affairs       Equal Opportunity Employment Commission       Federal Reserve Board       National Science Foundation       Office of Personnel Management       Small Business Administration       U.S. Commission on Civil Rights       Office of Management and Budget,  ex officio                The Interagency Committee developed a set of general principles to govern the       review process.  This process was designed not only to evaluate suggestions received      from the public but also to balance statistical issues, data needs, social concerns, and the      personal dimensions of racial and ethnic identification.  These principles were as follows:             1. The racial and ethnic categories set forth in the standards should not be      interpreted as being primarily biological or genetic in reference.  Race and ethnicity may      be thought of in terms of social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry.             2. Respect for individual dignity should guide the processes and methods for      collecting data on race and ethnicity; ideally, respondent self-identification should be      facilitated to the greatest extent possible, recognizing that in some data collection systems      observer identification is more practical.             3. To the extent practicable, the concepts and terminology should reflect clear and      generally understood definitions that can achieve broad public acceptance.  To assure      they are reliable, meaningful, and understood by respondents and observers, the racial and      ethnic categories set forth in the standard should be developed using appropriate scientific      methodologies, including the social sciences.             4. The racial and ethnic categories should be comprehensive in coverage and      produce compatible, nonduplicative, exchangeable data across Federal agencies.             5. Foremost consideration should be given to data aggregations by race and      ethnicity that are useful for statistical analysis and program administration and      assessment, bearing in mind that the standards are not intended to be used to establish      eligibility for participation in any federal program.             6. The standards should be developed to meet, at a minimum, Federal legislative      and programmatic requirements.  Consideration should also be given to needs at the State      and local government levels, including American Indian tribal and Alaska Native village      governments, as well as to general societal needs for these data.             7. The categories should set forth a minimum standard; additional categories      should be permitted provided they can be aggregated to the standard categories.  The      number of standard categories should be kept to a manageable size, determined by      statistical concerns and data needs.             8. A revised set of categories should be operationally feasible in terms of burden      placed upon respondents; public and private costs to implement the revisions should be a      factor in the decision.             9. Any changes in the categories should be based on sound methodological      research and should include evaluations of the impact of any changes not only on the      usefulness of the resulting data but also on the comparability of any new categories with      the existing ones.             10. Any revision to the categories should provide for a crosswalk at the time of      adoption between the old and the new categories so that historical data series can be      statistically adjusted and comparisons can be made.             11. Because of the many and varied needs and strong interdependence of Federal      agencies for racial and ethnic data, any changes to the existing categories should be the      product of an interagency collaborative effort.             12. Time will be allowed to phase in any new categories.  Agencies will not be      required to update historical records.             13. The new directive should be applicable throughout the U.S. Federal statistical      system.  The standard or standards must be usable for the decennial census, current      surveys, and administrative records, including those using observer identification.             The committee recognized that these principles may in some cases represent      competing goals for the standards.  By applying these principles to the review process,      the committee hoped to produce a standard that would result in consistent, publicly      accepted data on race and ethnicity that would meet the needs of the Federal Government      and the public while, at the same time, recognizing the diversity of the population and      respecting the individual's dignity.             OMB invited comment on the principles when they were published in a June 9,      1994,  Federal Register  Notice.  That Notice also contained  background information on      the development of Directive No. 15; the revision proposed but not made in 1988; the      1993 congressional hearings; and the CNSTAT workshop.  OMB requested public      comment on the adequacy of the current categories, as well as on the suggested changes it      had received over the years.  As part of the public comment period, OMB also held      hearings in Boston, Denver, San Francisco, and Honolulu during July 1994.  OMB      received nearly 800 letters in response to the 1994  Federal  Register  Notice and heard      testimony of 94 witnesses during the four public hearings.  A wide array of interested      parties provided comments, including individuals, data users, and data providers from      within and outside the Federal Government.         1.5 Overview of Research Activities              The Interagency Committee created a Research Working Group to outline an      agenda for researching and testing key concerns.  The Research Working Group, in      August 1995, issued the ""Research Agenda for the Review of the Racial and Ethnic      Categories in Directive No. 15,"" based on an examination of the information in the June      1994  Federal Register  Notice, the public comments it engendered,  and previous research.       This agenda identified five central research issues together with a number of questions      associated with these issues.  Some of the questions cut across several of the central      issues, and others were unique to a particular issue.  In developing the research agenda,      the Research Working Group gave equal weight to the conceptual and the operational      questions that must be answered before any changes to Directive No. 15 can be      considered.  The five central  issues were:               (1)  Reporting of multiple races .  What are the possible  effects of including a      multiple race response option or a multiracial category in data collections that ask      individuals to identify their race and ethnicity?             (2)  Combining questions on race and Hispanic origin .   Should a combined      race/Hispanic origin question be used instead of separate questions on race and Hispanic      origin?             (3)  Concepts of race, ethnicity, and ancestry .  Should the  concepts of race,      ethnicity, and ancestry be combined and include, for example, a follow-up, open-ended      question with no fixed categories?  How well does the public understand these three      concepts?             (4)  Terminology .  Should any of the current terminology for  the racial and ethnic      categories be replaced or modified?             (5)  New classifications .  Should new racial or ethnic  categories be developed for      specific population groups and be added to the minimum basic set of categories?               The most important conceptual questions surrounding these issues were (1) who      are the stakeholders, (2) how are various terms used and understood, (3) what is the      respondent's view of the task of self-identification, (4) what would be the effects of any      changes on population counts and historical trends, and (5) what would be the effects of      any changes on the quality and usefulness of the resulting data?  The most important      operational questions were (1) how would the changes affect data collection procedures,      (2) what differences might there be between collection and reporting categories, (3) how      could continuity be maintained, (4) how should any changes be implemented, and (5)       how might cognitive research assist in implementing any changes?  In addition to      recommending research that should be done, the Research Working Group both      encouraged and supported a number of more specific research projects carried out by the      individual agencies.             The first national test related to the central issues was the May 1995 Supplement      on Race and Ethnicity to the Current Population Survey (CPS), which had a sample of      approximately 60,000 households and more than 100,000 persons.  The supplement,      sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and conducted by the Bureau of the Census,      tested the effects of:   (1) adding a multiracial category to the list of races, and (2)      including ""Hispanic"" as a category on the race question.  Respondents also were asked      about their preferences for terms to describe themselves (e.g., African-American or Black      and Latino or Hispanic).  Originally, questions concerning the respondent's      understanding of the concepts of race, ethnicity, and ancestry were to be included, but      extensive cognitive testing prior to creating the survey instrument indicated that these      types of questions were confusing and difficult to administer in a large-scale survey.       Additional analysis of open-ended responses by cognitive researchers provided possible      explanations for the inconsistencies in some respondents' answers to the race and      ethnicity questions.              As a part of the research on the subject content for the 2000 census, the Bureau of      the Census tested alternative versions of questions on race and Hispanic origin in the      March 1996 National Content Survey (NCS).  This test was designed to provide      information on how members of approximately 90,000 households identify their race and      ethnicity in a self-reporting context, in contrast to the CPS Supplement which was      administered by interviewers either in person or by telephone.  Some NCS panels,      comprising about 18,000 households, tested the effects of adding a multiracial category to      the race question, placing the Hispanic origin question immediately before the race      question, and combining both of these changes.  The NCS sample was not designed to      detect possible effects of different treatments on relatively small population groups, such      as American Indians and Alaskan Natives, detailed Asian and Pacific Islander groups      (such as Chinese and Hawaiians), or detailed Hispanic origin groups (such as Puerto      Ricans and Cubans).  Moreover, because the results were based on the responses from      households in the national sample that mailed back questionnaires, the results do not      represent the entire national population.               In contrast to the NCS, the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test (RAETT) was designed      by the Bureau of the Census to provide findings for smaller population groups.       Conducted in June 1996, the RAETT sample included approximately 112,000 urban and      rural households.  The sample was taken from geographic areas of the country with      concentrations of different racial and ethnic populations including American Indians,      Alaskan Natives, Asians, Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, Blacks, and White ethnic groups.        This design permits assessments of the effects of changes on relatively small populations      not reliably measured in national samples.  The RAETT tested and evaluated the effects      of adding a ""multiracial or biracial"" category; having instructions in the race question to      ""mark one or more"" or to ""mark all that apply; placing the Hispanic origin item before the      race item; combining race, Hispanic origin, and ancestry in a single, two-part question;      using a combined ""Indian (Amer.) or Alaska Native"" category; and using a ""Native      Hawaiian"" or ""Hawaiian"" category.              In the spring of 1995, the National Center for Education Statistics and the Office for      Civil Rights in the Department of Education conducted a survey of a thousand public      schools.  This survey obtained information on how schools currently collect data on      students' race and ethnicity, how administrative records containing data on race and      ethnicity are maintained and reported, what state laws mandate or require of school      systems with respect to collecting data on race and ethnicity, and current issues in schools      regarding categories for reporting data on race and ethnicity.             The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held a Workshop on the Use of      Race and Ethnicity in Public Health Surveillance.  The workshop had three objectives: (1)      to describe the current measures of race and ethnicity and their use in public health      surveillance, (2) to assess the use of data on race and ethnicity in surveillance for      planning, operation, and evaluation of public health programs, and (3) to propose better      use of existing measures for race and ethnicity or to identify alternative measures.  The      limitations inherent in the current concepts, measures, and uses of race and ethnicity in      public health surveillance were identified, and recommendations were made regarding      their improvement.             The National Center for Health Statistics and the Office of Public Health and      Science sponsored interviews with 763 multiracial and Hispanic women who had a baby      during the preceding three years.  The purpose of the study was to determine the effects      of different question formats on reporting of race on birth certificates.  The standard      open-ended race question was compared with two experimental versions: (1) an open-ended race question that included the term ""multiracial"" as one of several examples, and      (2) a ""mark all that apply"" format.  When possible, results were compared with the race      the respondent recorded on the youngest child's birth certificate.             A literature search on work related to racial classification in the health field (using      MEDLINE) was conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).       An inventory of HHS minority health data bases that provides information on the data      available and on the data collection problems that have been encountered was developed.             A focus group was conducted with state and local government members of the      Association of Public Data Users.  The participants were asked about possible effects of      various suggested changes on their organizations.  An expert on redistricting and      reapportionment was interviewed concerning the effects these same changes might have      on reapportionment and redistricting following the 2000 census.  A survey of a small      number of businesses and professional associations that rely on Federal statistics also was      undertaken to ascertain views about the time and costs involved if various changes were      made.         1.6  Evaluation of Research Results              Although some of the issues surrounding the proposed revisions may ultimately      be settled through policy discussion and the criteria used may at times be subjective, there      is an important place in the discussion for empirically grounded research.  Thus, this      evaluation, while considering such subjective information as stakeholder positions and      respondent burden, focuses on the following objective criteria:                 (1) ease of adhering to the principle of self-identification;               (2) consistency and quality of measurement across time with respect to various      subgroups;               (3) magnitude of changes to current time series;               (4) ability to provide categories that are meaningful for policy purposes;               (5) ability to develop implementable reporting standards for all data providers;               (6) ease of using the measures in different data collection settings;               (7) ease of creating data editing and adjustment procedures; and               (8) costs associated with changing or not changing the standards.  >             To facilitate the use of research results to evaluate alternatives and develop      recommendations, the Research Working Group has acted as a clearinghouse for data      gathering activities.  As such, the Research Working Group has monitored various      projects and overseen the consolidation of results in a form intended to be useful for           policy makers.        CHAPTER 2.  Issues of General Concern        2.1 Overview             This section provides a discussion of several general concerns that the Research      Working Group considered during its review of Directive No. 15.  They are: (1) statutory       and programmatic needs of the Federal agencies for data on race and ethnicity, (2) voting      rights issues, (3) data continuity concerns, and (4) financial costs of making changes to      the Directive.   These concerns merit general consideration because they must be      confronted to some degree when dealing with any of the proposed changes.  The      relationship of specific suggested changes to these concerns will be addressed in later      chapters.         2.2 Satisfying Statutory and Program Needs              Federal agencies that collect data on race and ethnicity include, but are not limited      to, the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease      Control and Prevention, the National Center for Health Statistics,  and the National      Center for Education Statistics.  Agencies use data on race and ethnicity for      administrating Federal programs, for enforcing the civil rights laws, and for analyses of      social, economic, and health trends for population groups.             A principal driving force in the 1970s for the development of the current      standards was the need for data on race and ethnicity to enforce the civil rights laws.       Some of the agencies that use these data for monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws      include the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Commission      on Civil Rights, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, the Office of      Federal Contract Compliance Programs in the Department of Labor,  the Office for Civil      Rights in the Department of Education, and the Office for Civil Rights in the Department      of Health and Human Services.  State and local governments, educational institutions,       and private sector employers use the categories when providing data on race and ethnicity      to meet Federal reporting requirements.             Reliable and consistent information is important for enforcing Federal laws.  In      recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions involving education, employment, and voting      rights, the Court has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States      Constitution to require that governmental decision-making based on racial classifications      be subjected to ""strict scrutiny"" to determine whether it is ""narrowly tailored"" to meet      ""compelling State interests.""  Changes in Directive No. 15 could affect the ability of      agencies to carry out the court's mandate.  If, for instance, allowing individuals to identify      with more than one race would  make it more difficult to identify the members and      characteristics of a particular racial or ethnic group (such as American Indians and Alaska      Natives, or Asians and Pacific Islanders), then determining whether a ""compelling State      interest"" exists with regard to such persons--and whether the government's action is      narrowly enough tailored to meet that interest--could become correspondingly more      difficult.             Generally, the statutes that require collection of data on race and/or ethnicity do      not specify the exact categories that Federal agencies must use.  Most of these laws      simply require that data on race and ethnicity be collected.  The following examples      illustrate statutory requirements that specify the exact categories particular agencies must      use:              The Federal Affirmative Employment Program of the U.S. Equal  Employment                Opportunity Commission is required by 29 CFR 1607.4B. to use the minimum                OMB  Directive No. 15 categories except in Hawaii (where detailed Asian or                Pacific Islander subgroups are to be collected) and Puerto Rico (Hispanic and                non-Hispanic)                Federal agencies are required by the Office of Personnel  Management's Federal                Personnel Manual 292-I (Book III, pp. 106-107, 296-233 and 298-302) to collect                the minimum racial and ethnic categories and eleven national origin categories                (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Guamanian, Hawaiian, Japanese, Korean,                Samoan, Vietnamese, all other Asian or Pacific Islanders, and not Hispanic in                Puerto Rico) for the Central Personnel Data Files.              Legislation covering collection of data on race by the Bureau  of Indian Affairs has                varying definitions of Indian depending on the program (Indian Reorganization                Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. 479 and 25 CFR part 5).              Contract Compliance Programs of the Employment Standards  Administration are                required by 41CFR chapter 60 (EEO) to collect data on race and ethnicity for                workforce analysis using the categories ""Blacks, Spanish-surnamed Americans,                American Indians, and Orientals"" (41 CFR 60-2.11).               Data on race and ethnicity from employee selection tests and  procedures are to be                collected using the categories ""Blacks (Negroes), American Indians (including                Alaskan Natives), Asians (including Pacific Islanders), Hispanic (including                persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other                Spanish origin or culture regardless of race), Whites (Caucasians) other than                Hispanic, and totals"" (41 CFR 60-3.4B.).              The Center for Minority Veterans of the Department of Veterans  Affairs is                required by Sec. 509, Public Law 103-446 and 38 U.S.C. 317 to use the categories                Asian American, Black, Hispanic, Native American (including American Indian,                Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian), and Pacific-Islander American.           2.3 Voting Rights Issues              Concerns have been raised that changes to the current categories for data on race      and ethnicity may affect the usefulness of the data for congressional reapportionment,      legislative redistricting, and enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.             Following each decennial census, congressional reapportionment--the      redistribution of the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives among the 50      States--is calculated using the population totals for each state and the formula of ""equal      proportions"" adopted by the Congress in 1941 (United States Code, Title 2, Section 2a).       Redistricting is the process of redrawing the boundaries of congressional, state, and local      legislative districts in accordance with the Fourteenth Amendment's  ""one-person/one-vote"" principle and the standard of population equality  as set forth in  Wesberry v.      Sanders ,  Reynolds v. Sims , and subsequent court decisions.   Changes to Directive No. 15      would be expected to affect congressional reapportionment and one-person/one-vote      compliance in redistricting only to the extent that such changes affect the overall response      to the decennial census.             Charges of minority vote dilution--the claim that the redistricting plan or at-large      election system minimizes or cancels out the voting strength of a minority group--under      Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (which applies nationwide) are usually determined by      reference to decennial census data on race and ethnicity.  In addition, compliance with      Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act--which requires Federal preclearance for new voting      practices and procedures in certain states--also is generally determined by reference to      decennial census data on race and ethnicity.  Changes to Directive No. 15 could have      implications for the effective implementation of the Voting Rights Act.             Decennial census data are used to determine the count and distribution of the      voter-eligible minority population.  Proof that it is possible to draw a district with a      voter-eligible minority population in the majority is usually needed to establish a vote      dilution claim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Changes to the current      categories that alter the counts of voter-eligible minorities could affect the ability of such      groups to mount successful vote dilution claims.  The Attorney General's preclearance      determinations pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act--whether to grant or deny      Section 5 preclearance--are often affected by the size and distribution of the minority      population.             In addition, data on race and ethnicity from the decennial census frequently are      used as independent variables in statistical procedures that estimate group voting      behavior, particularly when counts of registered voters by race or ethnicity are not      available.  These estimates of group voting behavior are essential to vote dilution claims      under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as well as to the analysis of many types of      voting changes under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.          2.4  Data Continuity Concerns              If changes are made to the Federal standards for collecting data on race and      ethnicity, it will be critically important to data users to understand the impact of those      changes vis-a-vis the categories they have been using for the past 20 years.  The      acceptance of new ways of reporting race and ethnicity may require supporting      information so that users can assess the magnitude of changes to current time series.  To      that end, alternative methods of tabulating multiple responses on race into the current      minimum set of categories must be investigated further.         2.5  Financial Costs              If  OMB were to revise the categories for data on race and ethnicity by modifying      Directive No. 15, a sizeable number of Federal agencies and others would have to change      data collection forms, computer programs, interviewers' and coders' manuals, and other      related materials for their data systems.  Although Directive No. 15 is a standard for use      by Federal agencies, many State and local agencies and private sector entities also follow      the Federal standards for collection, record keeping, and presentation data on race and      ethnicity.  On the other hand, there will be other costs incurred if changes are not made to      the current categories, and these costs are also discussed in this section.              If a decision were made either to use separate questions exclusively, or to use a      combined format always, or  to use a ""mark one or more"" reporting option for race, or to      add a ""multiracial"" category, there would also be costs for redesigning data editing,      coding, and processing systems to accommodate the changes.             Other costs would be associated with changing data base management, retrieval      and aggregation programs, and historical table formats.  Data base management systems      might have to be significantly expanded to provide data comparability with historical      series.  Procedures might have to be developed for editing multiple responses to achieve      this comparability.  Staff would have to be trained in the new procedures resulting from      any change to the current categories.  Since the estimated transition time for changing      EEOC data bases would be 2-3 years, data for these years could be severely hampered for      enforcement purposes.  This would likely result in additional costs for protracted      processing of grievances.               The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of      Health and Human Services has noted that substantial changes for 23 categorical grant      programs would be required for competing and noncompeting grant application materials,      data entry and report programs, and the preference/priority databases.  Alterations in the      current collection categories for data on race and ethnicity would require restructuring of      the definitions and data collection tools designed to report cross-cutting outcome      measures for Title VII and VIII Health Professions and Nursing education and training      programs.               During informal discussions, company representatives offered a few examples of      the potential impact on private sector employers if changes to the categories were to be      made.  The costs of making changes to forms is considered to be minimal.  Changes in      the data systems would be more expensive than changes in the forms, since this effort      would be very labor intensive.  In addition, if there were new categories, employees      might have to be resurveyed in order to update the information on race and ethnicity.               Any changes from the current collection mechanism would entail major program      changes for the 700 institutions participating in the seven student assistance      campus-based loan and scholarship programs.  Review and revision of records for      eligibility and fiscal accounting data would be required, including manual review of data,      computer programming changes, and changes to the scope of work for contract services.       In addition, the Student Financial Aid Guideline and the User Manual for the Electronic      Reporting System would require review and revision. Moreover, changes in definitions      would require that schools reconcile past and current submissions of data for      compatibility to enable HRSA to make appropriate awards to participating institutions.             The Administration on Children and Families (ACF) of the Department of Health      and Human Services considers the overall effect of change to the racial and ethnic      categories to be marginal. ACF collects data on race and ethnicity for several internal data      systems (e.g., foster care, personnel, grant-related information).  However, in relation to      the total cost of maintenance of these internal data systems, possible changes in the      classification of data on race and ethnicity are likely to have only marginal effects.       Alterations to racial and ethnic categories used for data systems maintained by private      contractors for ACF (e.g., Head Start, Child Abuse and Neglect, Developmentally      Disabled, Native American) would not likely cause excessive burden to the data      collection effort.               In addition, ACF has data systems that are legislatively mandated and involve      data collections by states (such as temporary assistance to needy families, child support      enforcement).  If the alterations to existing systems are profound, states might be resistant      to change or they might seek Federal funds to defray costs of updating state data systems,      particularly to meet Federal reporting requirements.              While financial costs would be incurred if changes are made to Directive No. 15,      there are other types of costs associated with not making changes.  Problems that exist      with use of the current Directive will not be resolved.  These continuing problems include      lack of standardization for classifying data on race and ethnicity across state and Federal      agencies; less than optimal participation in Federal surveys (especially item      nonresponse); misidentification of individuals and groups in surveys; inaccurate counts      and rates; inaccurate research; inaccurate program design, targeting and monitoring; and      possibly misallocation of funds.  There will continue to be inconsistency even within the      same Federal agency if Hispanic origin data continues to be collected using either the      combined format or two separate questions.  It is not uncommon for the denominator of a      rate for Hispanics to be based on data collected using separate questions on race and            ethnicity while the numerator is based on data collected using the combined format.      Chapter 3.  Reporting More Than One Race        3.1  Background             This chapter addresses issues related to whether or not the Federal standards for      data on race and ethnicity should provide an option that permits the reporting of more      than one race.  The chapter discusses different approaches that have been studied by      Federal agencies to provide such an option.  It presents findings of the research conducted      by Federal agencies on the alternative approaches and identifies potential implications of      providing or not providing a response option for reporting more than one race.  Following      a review of the current standards and an overview of the research conducted, the chapter      addresses the following questions:                 Should a multiracial category be listed among the response  options to the question on race?  (section 3.4.2)              If a multiracial category is listed, should a ""follow-up""  format be used, in which                individuals who select ""multiracial"" are asked in a follow-up question to specify                their racial identities? (section 3.4.3)              Should a multiple-response format be used in which the  respondent is instructed to ""mark one or more races""?  (section 3.4.4)              Should a multiple-response format be used in which the  respondent is instructed to ""mark all that apply"" on the race question?   (section 3.4.5)               Are there other options for reporting of more than one race by  respondents?  (section 3.4.6)               Sections 3.5 through 3.7 discuss some of the trends, concerns, and potential      implications related to adding (or not adding) an option for reporting more than one race      to the Federal standard for collecting and reporting racial categories, including the effects      on such areas as legal and program needs, measurement issues, and data production.         3.2  Current Practice             Directive No. 15 provides a minimum set of racial and ethnic categories--four      categories for data on race (White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Asian      or Pacific Islander) and two categories for data on ethnicity (Hispanic origin and not of      Hispanic origin).  The current standard permits Federal agencies to use more detailed      categories for collecting data on population groups, so long as the data collection is      organized in a way that makes it possible for the agencies to aggregate the more detailed      designations into the Directive No. 15 categories.             For persons who identify with more than one race, Directive No. 15 indicates that      the single racial category which most closely reflects the individual's recognition in his or      her community should be used.  Directive No. 15 does not provide for identifying two or      more races.         3.3 Overview of Research on Reporting More Than One Race             To assist OMB in deciding whether or not the Federal standard should provide for      reporting more than one race, Federal agencies have conducted several major surveys to      test the possible effects on data quality of various options.  Major objectives of the      research and testing programs carried out in 1995 and 1996 have included:              Analysis of the growth, characteristics, and  self-identification patterns of persons in interracial marriages and  households;               Cognitive research to develop alternative race questions with  a category called ""multiracial"" or response options such as ""mark one or  more"" or ""mark all that apply;""              Empirical research on how reporting more than one race is  likely to affect current                racial distributions in self-administered censuses and surveys (compared, for                example, with interviewer and telephone surveys); and              Research on whether most respondents who self-identified as  multiracial will specify more than one race.            3.3.1 Surveys to Explore Options              The Current Population Survey, conducted jointly by the Bureau of Labor      Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of the Census, included a Supplement on Race and      Ethnicity in May 1995 (the CPS Supplement).  The CPS Supplement was designed to test      the effect of asking questions about race and Hispanic ethnicity, with and without a      multiracial response option.  As part of its research and testing program for Census 2000,      the Bureau of the Census conducted two additional studies--the National Content Survey      (also known as the 1996 census survey or the Census 2000 survey) and the Race and      Ethnic Targeted Test (the RAETT)--to explore the implications of using different formats      for questions on respondents' racial identification and reporting of Hispanic origin.          3.3.2 Cognitive Research to Guide Survey Design              The agencies conducted extensive cognitive research to pretest the racial and      ethnic categories and the sequencing of the questions on race and Hispanic origin in the      survey instruments.  An interagency team conducted cognitive research on several      versions of the CPS Supplement questionnaire designed for face-to-face and telephone      interviews.  The race question included a multiracial category, with a follow-up question      for reporting the races with which the respondent identified. The questionnaire was tested      with a range of racial and ethnic groups in various regions of the United States, and      respondents from all groups were able to report that the term ""multiracial"" meant more      than one race.  (McKay and de la Puente, 1995)             The Bureau of the Census conducted cognitive research on two different options      for reporting more than one race on the race item in a mail survey form.  The options      consisted of including (1) a ""multiracial"" category in the race question, and (2) an      instruction to mark one or more of the racial categories provided in the race question.             The cognitive research guided the placement of a separate multiracial category in      the race item, determined the appropriate number of write-in lines to the multiracial-response box, identified the appropriate terminology for soliciting response from persons      of mixed racial parentage (without providing a definition of ""multiracial"" for this      population), and guided the development of the instructions allowing respondents to      choose more than one box.  Because the cognitive research revealed that some      respondents believed the term ""multiracial"" meant more than two races, the wording      ""multiracial or biracial"" was used in the NCS and the RAETT to convey to respondents      that the category is to be used by those who identify with two or more racial groups.       (Gerber and de la Puente, 1996)             The cognitive research also was used to develop a ""mark one or more"" instruction,      indicating that respondents could mark more than one racial category as applicable.  The      initial cognitive work, which offered respondents the choice of marking one racial      category or marking more than one racial category, asked those selecting more than one      group to specify the race with which they most identified.               Cognitive interviews tested several versions of this question.  A number of      problems were identified in these interviews.  First, some respondents could not absorb or      understand the complex instructions that were necessary.  Second, the formatting (which      was subject to space limitations) made it difficult for some respondents to read and      absorb the question fully.  Third, respondents who expected a ""multiracial"" category were      disappointed that this response option was not provided.  And finally, some respondents      were not comfortable with being asked to designate a single race, when they did not want      to discount any part of their racial heritage.  The question that was ultimately used asked      respondents merely to mark the boxes, without also asking them to designate the race      with which they most identified.  (Gerber and de la Puente, 1996)             Respondents for the cognitive research were recruited on the basis of interracial      parentage or ancestry.  In testing the use of multiracial reporting options in both the      interview and self-administered mail modes, researchers found that many of the      respondents recruited based on known multiracial status did not choose to report as      multiracial.  Reasons they gave for not selecting the multiracial category included:       identification with the racial and cultural group of one parent; acceptance of the racial      identity perceived to be conferred by their community; and a lack of identification with a      ""multiracial"" group encompassing members of different racial ancestries.  (McKay and de      la Puente, 1995; Gerber and de la Puente, 1996)         3.4  Evaluating Research on Options for Reporting   More Than One Race             The sections that follow present results from the CPS Supplement, the National      Content Survey, and the RAETT as they bear on the alternative approaches outlined at      the beginning of this chapter (See section 3.1).  Brief descriptions of these surveys      follow.             The Current Population Survey is a monthly national sample survey of      approximately 60,000 households; it routinely collects information on the race and ethnic      origin of household members using the current Directive No. 15 categories.  The May      1995 CPS Supplement collected additional racial and ethnic data on the households under      four different panel conditions:          Panel 1   Separate race and Hispanic-origin questions, with no ""multiracial""                     category       Panel 2   Separate race and Hispanic-origin questions, with ""multiracial"" category       Panel 3   Combined race and Hispanic-origin question, with no ""multiracial""                     category       Panel 4   Combined race and Hispanic-origin question, with ""multiracial"" category          The CPS Supplement had a response rate of 82.9 percent.             The National Content Survey (NCS), conducted from March through June 1996,      was a mail survey of 94,500 households drawn from 1990 decennial census ""mail back      areas"" representing about 95 percent of the country.  The NCS included thirteen panels,      four of which were designed to evaluate the effects of adding a "" multiracial or biracial""       category and reversing the sequence of the questions on race and Hispanic origin.  It is      less representative of American Indians and Alaska Natives, given that about 25 percent      of those populations live outside ""mail back areas.""             The NCS panels were as follows:          Panel 1 - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions--no  ""multiracial or biracial""                     category; race first sequence        Panel 2 - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions--with  ""multiracial or biracial""                     category; race first sequence        Panel 3 - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions--no  ""multiracial or biracial""                     category; Hispanic origin first sequence        Panel 4 - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions--with  ""multiracial or biracial""                      category; Hispanic origin first sequence                Each of the four questionnaires was mailed to a panel of about 6,000 households.       The response rate for the four panels was 72 percent; the results are thus based on      approximately 18,000 households.  Computer-assisted telephone reinterviews were      conducted with each household that had completed and returned the NCS form.  Because      the NCS sample excluded households outside 1990 census mailback areas, and some      households did not return a questionnaire, results from the NCS cannot be generalized to      the entire national population.             The RAETT, conducted by the Bureau of the Census in the summer of 1996, was      the principal vehicle for testing and evaluating several important proposed changes for      the race question.  The RAETT targeted 112,000 households in areas that have, relative to      the Nation as a whole, high concentrations of households in any one of six specified      racial or ethnic groups:  White ethnic (whether European, Canadian, or American), Black,      American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Hispanic origin.  A total      of 58,911 questionnaires were returned, yielding an overall response rate of 53 percent.       The RAETT included questions designed to test the effects of a ""multiracial or biracial""      category as well as ""mark one or more"" and ""mark all that apply"" approaches to reporting      more than one race, and a combined question on race and Hispanic origin, using eight      different panels or versions of the questionnaire.  The RAETT panels were as follows:          Panel A - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions--no  ""multiracial or biracial""                     category; Hispanic origin first sequence        Panel B - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions with  ""multiracial or biracial""                     category with write-ins; Hispanic origin first sequence        Panel C - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions with "" mark one  or more                     races"" instruction; Hispanic origin first sequence        Panel D - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions with a  ""multiracial or biracial""                     category with write-ins; race first sequence          Panel E - Combined race, Hispanic origin, and ancestry question with  a ""multiracial                     or biracial"" category        Panel F - Combined race, Hispanic origin, and ancestry with ""mark one  or more                     boxes"" instruction        Panel G - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions with   ""multiracial or biracial""                     category with write-ins; Hispanic origin first sequence; tested terminology                     and alphabetization of categories        Panel H - Separate race and Hispanic origin questions with ""mark all  that apply"" instruction; Hispanic origin first sequence               Each of these surveys provides important information about options for collecting      and classifying data on race and ethnicity, but each also has its limitations.  The CPS      Supplement is nationally representative and data were gathered for over 80 percent of the      sample, but it could not provide reliable information for smaller groups in the population.       The NCS is close to being nationally representative and its use of a mail out/mail back      questionnaire is particularly relevant for designing the 2000 census, but the response rate      was only 72 percent, and it too could not provide reliable information for smaller groups.              The RAETT design provides a good test of the possible effects of suggested new      racial categories because it focuses on populations for which the national surveys often      do not provide sufficiently large samples.  However, even with a 100 percent response to      the RAETT, results could be generalized only to the population in the census tracts in      each targeted sample frame.  The actual response rate averaged 53 percent, and the      response rates in some targeted samples were as low as 34 percent.  The sample design of      RAETT also does not permit results for different targeted samples to be combined.         3.4.1 Data Comparability             A key concern of some Federal agencies, reflected in the principles that have      guided the review of the current standards, has been the comparability of data from any      new categories with information produced under the existing categories.  In its report on      the RAETT, the Bureau of the Census presented -- for purposes of illustration -- different      approaches for tabulating the data, using the information provided in the write-in entries      to the ""multiracial or biracial"" category and in multiple responses to the race question.       Some of these classification approaches provide examples of procedures that could be      developed and used by the agencies as ""bridges"" between the current and any new      classification.  The three illustrative approaches were termed the single-race approach, the      all-inclusive approach, and the historical series approach.  They may be characterized as      follows:              Single-race approach.   Responses indicating only one racial  category would be      assigned to that category.  Responses from individuals who reported multiple races would      be classified into a separate ""multiple race"" category.  This method provides a lower      bound for the number who identify with a given category.  The results from this approach      are readily available from standard tabulations.              All-inclusive approach.   Responses are classified into each  racial category      specified using the minimum set of categories in Directive No. 15.  With a single      race/ethnicity question using the combined format in Directive No. 15, the all-inclusive      Hispanic proportion would be most comparable to the proportion  reporting Hispanic      when there are separate questions, one for race and one for ethnicity.             The sum of the percentages reported for the four separate racial categories would      exceed 100 percent, because multiple race responses would be counted in each reported      racial category.  In spite of this disadvantage, the all-inclusive approach would provide      information on the total number of times the racial category had been selected.              Historical series approach.   Unlike the single race or the  all-inclusive approach,      the historical series approach can take on many variations, just one of which was used in      the RAETT illustrative tabulations.  The intent of this approach is to classify data into      categories that resemble those that have been used historically to enforce current civil      rights laws.  An individual's response (or responses) is classified into one and only one      category, in a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories that add up to 100      percent.  For example, in the report on the RAETT, which tested a "" multiracial or      biracial"" category with a write-in to specify races as well as other options for reporting      more than one race, the historical series approach classified into the Asian or Pacific      Islander category responses of (1) only the Asian or Pacific Islander category, (2) the      Asian or Pacific Islander category and also White, (3) the Asian or Pacific Islander      category and Other Race, and (4) the Asian or Pacific Islander category and the      multiracial category, with no specification of additional races.   The ""multiracial"" or      ""other"" category in the historical series was a residual category which consisted of      responses to the ""multiracial"" category that did not specify any races; and responses of      two race categories other than ""White"" or ""Some Other Race.""  A more complete      description of the historical series approach is provided in the RAETT report.             Under the historical series approach, the percentages allocated to each of the      major categories were comparable to the data collected without a multiple race reporting      option (Panel A of the RAETT), except for the Alaska Native targeted sample.  The       discrepancy in this group may be due to the fact that this particular targeted sample      suffered from both a small sample size and from an extremely low response rate (34      percent).           3.4.2  Should a multiracial category be listed  among the response options to the question on race?             The CPS Supplement on Race and Ethnicity, the National Content Survey, and      the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test all allowed testing of the effects of adding a      multiracial category to the list of races.  The CPS Supplement used the term ""multiracial""      to identify the category, and the NCS and the RAETT used the term ""multiracial or      biracial.""              CPS Supplement.   In the CPS Supplement, the race  question on Panels 2 and 4      included a "" multiracial"" category; results were very similar -- a little more than 1.5      percent identified as multiracial in each panel.             Table 3.1 shows that the multiracial response option drew respondents primarily      from the American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut population, and from those who reported in      the ""Something Else"" category.  Without a multiracial response category, about 1 percent      reported as American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut.   With a multiracial category, about      0.75 percent reported in the American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut category only.             The proportions  reporting in the White category, in the Black category, and in the      Asian or Pacific Islander category were not affected by the introduction of the multiracial           option in the CPS Supplement.

From Tucker et al., 1996.                     National Content Survey.   In the NCS, the race  question included a multiracial      category (using the term ""multiracial or biracial"") in two of four panels.  The percent of      respondents identifying themselves as multiracial on the NCS was 1.2 percent on the      panel with the race question first (Panel 2), and 1.1 percent on the panel with the      Hispanic-origin question first (Panel 4).  Thus, as in the CPS, less than 2 percent of the      total population chose the multiracial category on the NCS.  Hispanics on the NCS were      more likely than the total population to identify as multiracial (6.7 percent in Panel 2 and      10.0 percent in Panel 4.)                  The addition of a multiracial category had no statistically significant effect on the      percentage of persons who reported as White, as Black, as American Indian, or as Asian      or Pacific Islander regardless of whether the race or the Hispanic-origin question was      asked first.  However, the relatively small sample size in the NCS might not detect      changes that were substantively important for small populations.                   For example, although not statistically significant, the declines in the proportion      reporting in the Asian or Pacific Islander category, from 4.0 percent to 2.7 percent in      panels where the race question came first, and from 3.4 percent to 2.8 percent when the      Hispanic-origin question was asked first, suggested that further analyses should be      undertaken.  An analysis of the Asian or Pacific Islander write-in responses for those who      reported in the multiracial category revealed that if these write-in responses had been      reported solely as Asian or Pacific Islander, the proportion of the population in that      category would have increased to about 3 percent.  These findings, however, cannot be      used to draw a firm conclusion about the effects of  adding a multiracial category on      reporting as Asian and Pacific Islander because the sample sizes were too small.              Adding a multiracial category significantly decreased reporting in the ""Other      race"" category when race was asked first, from 3.3 percent to 1.7 percent.  Reporting as      ""Other race"" decreased only 0.3 percent with a multiracial category when the Hispanic-origin question was asked first.              Race and Ethnic Targeted Sample.   The RAETT used a total of  eight panels,      Panels A through H (with A as the control panel).  Three of the panels specifically tested      the effects of reporting more than one race.  In Panel B, the RAETT tested the effects of      including a ""multiracial or biracial"" category.  In Panel C, it tested the effects of      instructing respondents to ""mark one or more"" in response to the race question; and in      Panel H, it tested the effects of instructing respondents to ""mark all that apply"" in      response to the race question.  The results are discussed in succeeding sections of this      chapter.             To determine the effects of including a multiracial category, responses to Panel B      are compared with responses to Panel A.  The findings indicate that the availability of the      option to report as ""multiracial or biracial"" had the most substantial effect in the Asian      and Pacific Islander and in the Alaska Native targeted samples.  In the other targeted      samples, use of the multiracial category had no significant effect on how race was      reported.  The percentages using the multiracial category in each of the other targeted      samples were under 1.0 percent for the White ethnic and the Black targeted samples, 2.33      percent for the Hispanic targeted sample, and 3.67 percent for the American Indian           targeted sample.  (See Table 3.2.)

In the Asian and Pacific Islander targeted sample, 7.58 percent in Panel B selected      the multiracial category, and another 3.06 percent marked more than one race, even      though they were instructed to mark only one.  The corresponding percentages in the      Alaska Native targeted sample were 7.07 percent and 6.32 percent.             The RAETT results show that, if there were the addition of a new category (e.g.,      multiracial), the proportion reporting in at least one of the current categories may be      reduced.  In the Asian and Pacific Islander targeted sample, about 2 percent fewer      reported in the White (only) category in Panel B, and about 4.5 percent fewer reported in      the Asian and Pacific Islander (only) category.   Within the Asian and Pacific Islander      category, the Hawaiian and the Asian Indian categories had the largest drops in reporting      from Panel A to Panel B.  However, the response rate for the Asian and Pacific Islander      targeted sample was only 55 percent, and the possible impact of nonresponse bias on            these comparisons is not known without further research.

From Bureau of the Census, 1997, Table 1-4R, p. D-6.     In the Alaska Native targeted sample, the response rate was only 34  percent, leading again to the possibility of nonresponse bias and the  need for further research.   This, and the fact that the percent  reporting White (only) increased by about 4.5 percent with the addition  of a multiracial category, suggests that the group reporting in Panel A  was different in some way from the group reporting in Panel B.  In this  targeted sample, the multiracial category drew primarily from the  American Indian and Alaska Native category.  (See  Table 3.4).

From Bureau of the  Census, 1997.        3.4.3  If a multiracial category is listed, should a ""follow-up"" format  be used, in which individuals who select the category are asked to  specify their racial identities?             All three of the major research surveys--the CPS Supplement, the NCS, and the      RAETT-- used a two-part question to evaluate the effects of a follow-up question on            reporting by different racial groups.              CPS Supplement.   The responses on the CPS Supplement to the  follow-up question for individuals who identified themselves as  multiracial are shown in Table 3.5.

With the exception of respondents who named only one race, the ""American      Indian + one other race"" group had the highest frequency in both panels, followed by      ""Asian/Pacific Islander + one race"" on Panel 4.  All but a small percentage of the      Hispanics who used the multiracial category reported only an  Hispanic ethnic group.  (McKay, Stinson, de la Puente, and Kojetin, 1996)              More than 60 percent of multiracial responses on Panel 2 and close to 20 percent      of multiracial responses on Panel 4 did not provide two or more different races.       Respondents who reported only a single race, or reported ethnicities as races, were      designated as ""unconfirmed multiracials.""   With the addition of an Hispanic category,      there was a 90 percent decline among Hispanic ""unconfirmed multiracials"" between      Panels 2 and 4.  There was also a 60 percent decline in such entries for non-Hispanics      between Panels 2 and 4, which is not readily explained by the presence of the Hispanic      category on Panel 4. (See Table 3.6.)             The decline in ""unconfirmed multiracials"" among Hispanics in Panel 4 may      reflect the effect of the combined race and Hispanic origin question on Hispanic      reporting.  In the case of non-Hispanics, the decline might result from the absence of the           influence of a preceding Hispanic origin question.

Note: The percentage distribution of the other races for ""American Indian, Eskimo,      Aleut"" respondents in the CPS Supplement was as follows:  Panel 1:  White, 17.89;      Black, 0.64; Asian or Pacific Islander, 0.70; Panel 2:  White, 22.10; Black, 10.17; Asian      or Pacific Islander, 1.95; Panel 3:  White, 14.24; Black, 0.63; Asian or Pacific Islander,      3.50; Hispanic, 4.57; Panel 4: White, 14.44; Black, 2.52; Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.98;                                             Hispanic, 7.43.          As reported above, only the percent of people identifying as American Indian,      Eskimo, or Aleut was significantly smaller when a multiracial category was used.       However, the largest movement from the American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut category is      always to the White category.  (See Note to Table 3.7.)  Only 4.24 percent of this group      used the multiracial category on Panel 2.  On Panel 4, 7.94 percent of those identifying      with this group on the CPS Supplement selected multiracial while 7.43 percent chose      Hispanic.  In sum, a  large number of individuals of mixed American Indian and White      ancestry changed their racial identification on the CPS Supplement but not necessarily to      the multiracial category.  This change had a noticeable effect on the American Indian,      Eskimo, and Aleut population counts without noticeably affecting  counts of the White population.             Researchers analyzed the distribution of CPS Supplement respondents choosing      the multiracial category by State to consider whether State legislative requirements for a      multiracial category on State records influenced the frequency with which this category      was chosen.  At the time of the study, Georgia was the only State with a law requiring a      multiracial category; six other States (Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, North      Carolina, and Ohio) were in the process of framing legislation requiring a multiracial      category.  The highest percentage of CPS respondents choosing the multiracial category      for these States was 1.5 percent.  Among other States, the five with the highest percentage      of respondents choosing the multiracial category were: Hawaii, Nevada, Washington,      Tennessee, and Alaska.  Of these, Hawaii was the highest, with 11.6 percent; the others       had percentages between 3.0 percent and 4.7 percent.             The CPS Supplement data were also analyzed to consider the effect of having      parents of different races on the reporting of the racial identity of children.  Of the CPS      households, less than 1 percent involved married partners of different races with children      under the age of 16 in the household.  About 13 percent of these households involved an      Asian/Pacific Islander mother and White father; about 11 percent, a White mother and      Black father; about 9 percent, a White mother and multiracial father; about 8 percent, an      Hispanic mother and White father; and about 8 percent, a multiracial mother and White      father.  Almost 32 percent of the children in these households identified as ""multiracial.""              National Content Survey.   In the National Content Survey  (NCS), virtually all      persons (98 percent) who marked the multiracial category in the panels that included this      category provided a write-in response.  More than half of these write-in responses (55      percent) identified two or more different races, and about a third showed a racial category      and a Hispanic-origin group.  The remainder of the write-in responses indicated only one      of the racial categories specified in Directive No. 15.             The vast majority (more than 80 percent) of the write-in responses to the      multiracial category included White.  (This result is consistent with research on      interracial and inter-ethnic marriages and households, which usually involve one White      spouse (92 percent) or White parent (86 percent).)  About 30 percent of the write-in      responses included the Asian or Pacific Islander category, about 25 percent involved the      Black category, and about 7 percent involved the American Indian category.  If the Asian      and Pacific Islander write-ins to the multiracial category had been tabulated solely as      Asian and Pacific Islander, the proportion of the population in that category would have      increased to about 3 percent, still smaller than the 4 percent who selected Asian and      Pacific Islander in Panel 1, without a multiracial category.                                Race and Ethnic Targeted Test.   Information from the  write-ins for panels B, D,      E, F, and G in the RAETT was tabulated in accordance with the ""historical series"" and      the ""all inclusive"" approaches described in section 3.4.1.  The results are useful in      assessing the extent to which write-ins can be used to provide the bridges to the      distributions provided by the current classifications.  These results are described in other                                      parts of this report.          3.4.4  Should a multiple-response format be used,  in which the respondent is instructed to ""mark one or more races""?              Another option for collecting data is to allow respondents to select more than one      race.  Some suggest that this approach has the advantage of preserving detailed data about      racial identification that might not be captured with a single multiracial response      category, even with write-in lines.  This section discusses one instruction that respondents      might be given; the next section discusses an alternative instruction.  Only the RAETT      tested these alternative approaches.              Race and Ethnic Targeted Test--Panels A and B.   In the  RAETT, some      respondents marked more than one box on Panels A and B, despite the instruction on      both panels to ""mark ONE box...""  (Panel B included a ""multiracial"" category; Panel A      did not.)  Reporting multiple races on Panel A was especially high in the Alaska Native      targeted sample (5.16 percent).  This percentage nearly approached the percentage who      selected the multiracial category on Panel B in this targeted sample (7.07 percent).       Multiple responses on Panel A were also substantial (3.76 percent) in the Asian and      Pacific Islander targeted sample.  (By comparison, it is estimated that 0.5 percent of      respondents to the 1990 census selected more than one race when asked to select only      one.)             In the targeted samples of the RAETT, the lowest frequency of marking multiple      races on panels with instructions to ""mark ONE box"" was 0.7 percent in the Black      targeted sample.  In the Asian and Pacific Islander targeted sample, persons who were      born in the United States were far more likely to report multiple races than the foreign-born.               In addition, respondents in all of the targeted samples marked one or more boxes      even for the panel that included a multiracial category.  That finding suggests that      marking multiple races may have a different meaning to some respondents than      identifying in a category labeled ""multiracial.""              Race and Ethnic Targeted Test--Panel C.   In the RAETT,  Panel C instructed      respondents to ""mark one or more"" races.  The percentages in each of the targeted      samples that provided multiple responses were under 2 percent for the White ethnic      targeted sample and the Black targeted sample, 3.57 percent for the Hispanic targeted      sample, 4.22 percent for the American Indian, and 10.03 percent for the Asian and Pacific      Islander targeted sample.  Approximately the same percentage marked only the Asian and      Pacific Islander category in Panel C as selected only that category in Panel A.  (The      Alaska Native targeted sample did not receive the option to mark one or more.)  (See      Table 3.8.)

From Bureau of the Census, 1997.      3.4.5  Should a multiple response format be used in  which the respondent is instructed to ""mark all that  apply"" on the race question?              Respondents evidently interpreted the instruction to ""mark all that apply""      somewhat differently than the instruction to ""mark one or more.""              Race and Ethnic Targeted Test--Panel H.   The percentages in  each of the      RAETT targeted samples that provided multiple responses in the ""mark all that apply""      option were under 2.0 percent for the White ethnic and the Black targeted samples,  2.24      percent for the Hispanic, 4.27 percent for the American Indian, and 11.47 percent for the      Asian and Pacific Islander targeted samples.  The Alaska Native targeted sample did not      receive this option.  (See Table 3.9.)

From Bureau of the Census, 1997.         In contrast to Panel C, significantly fewer respondents in the Asian and Pacific                Islander targeted sample in Panel H, with the ""mark all that apply"" instruction, selected                only the Asian and Pacific Islander category than was the case in Panel A.  (See Table                3.10.)  If those who marked Asian and Pacific Islander in combination with another                category are included with those who marked only Asian and Pacific Islander, the                percentages are about the same.   The ""historical series"" approach, described in section                3.4.1 above, also largely eliminated these reductions in reporting.  With this tabulation of                responses, the percentages reporting as Asian and Pacific Islander on Panel H no longer                               differed significantly from the percentage on Panel A.

From Bureau of the Census, 1997.      3.4.6  Are there other options for reporting more than  one race by respondents?             Another option for addressing concerns about reporting multiple races would be      to add the category ""Other"" to the list of races in all Federal data collections.  As      discussed in Chapter 1 of this report , in 1988, OMB considered a proposal to add      ""Other"" to the list of races.  Comments at that time indicated that the proposal was      controversial and consensus would not be easily reached.  The debate over the ""Other""      category has continued in the current review of racial and ethnic categories.  Some who      commented expressed support for the adoption of an ""Other"" category--if it is      open-ended, allowing the identification of biracial and multiracial people and ethnic      groups who do not identify with one of the major race groups.  Others viewed use of the      term as demeaning, or stated that the category was unnecessary or that it was too broad to      be of much use.  (OMB  Federal Register  Notice, 1995)             A special exemption from Directive No. 15, granted by OMB, allows the Bureau      of the Census to collect data using an ""Other race"" category, and that category was      included in the 1980 and 1990 decennial censuses.  In the 1990 Census, more than      250,000 Americans wrote in as their race designation a combination of races or used a      term such as ""Eurasian"" that indicates two or more races.             Under its special exemption, the Bureau of the Census does not assign the ""Other      race"" responses to the Directive No. 15 race categories.  The Bureau has, however,      developed a Modified Age-Race-Sex (MARS) file that assigns respondents to the      standard race categories in order to provide data comparable to vital statistics and other      statistical sources.  In developing the MARS file, the Bureau of the Census used a      complicated set of algorithms.  If OMB were to establish a new classification system that      provided the ""Other race"" option, a standard algorithm might be needed across agencies.       Alternatively, agencies could simply list ""Other race"" in tabulations.  (National Research      Council, 1996)          3.5 Trends With Respect to Reporting Multiple Races         3.5.1 Trends Contributing to Reporting of Multiple Races             As noted earlier in this chapter, a significant number of respondents select more      than one race even when asked to select only one.  At least two trends may be      contributing to this phenomenon.                 3.5.1.1  Increases in Interracial Marriages and Households and  Births to Parents of                         Different Races             Some of the impetus for considering an option that allows the reporting of more      than one race comes from the increasing number of interracial marriages and births to      parents of different races in the past 25 to 30 years.  Allowing individuals to report more      than one race could provide a more complete report of the Nation's changing society.             Data suggest that individuals from smaller racial population groups are more      likely to form interracial unions with individuals from outside their racial population      group than are individuals from the White and the Black populations.  The White      population is such a large proportion of the total United States population, however, that      in most interracial marriages one partner is White; similarly, for most children with      parents of different races, one parent is White.              In the 1970 census, there were about 321,000 interracial  unions.  By 1980, the                number had increased to about 1 million; and by 1990 there were about 1.5                million interracial couples.  In all but 8 percent of these interracial couples, one                spouse (or unmarried partner) was White.  In 14 percent of all interracial couples,                the non-White spouse was Black; in 22 percent, American Indian and Alaska                Native; in 31 percent, Asian and Pacific Islander; and in 25 percent, ""Other race""                  (most of whom were of Hispanic origin).              Census data indicate that the number of children in  interracial families grew from                less than one-half million in 1970 to about 2 million in 1990.  In 1990, in                interracial families with one white partner, for about 34 percent of all children the                other parent was American Indian; for 45 percent the other parent was Asian; and                for about 20 percent the other parent was Black.              In 1968, for 2 percent of the births with at least one Black  parent, the second                parent was reported as White on the birth certificate (8,800).  This percentage had                increased to 9 percent in 1994 (63,000).  Analysis of the change in the numbers of                births where one parent is Black and the other is some other race is complicated                by the increasing number of births for which the race of the second parent, usually                the father, is not given on the birth certificate--40 percent in 1994, compared with                24 percent in 1968.  (See Graph 3.1, Births to Minority and White Parents as a                Percent of All Births to Minority Parents by Race of Minority Parent:  1968 to                1994.)              Even with this limitation it can be inferred, from births for  which both parents'                races are known, that births involving one Black parent and a second parent of                another race other than White also are increasing.               Among births to American Indian and Alaska Native parents, a  high percentage of                all births involve a second parent of another race.  In 1968, 28 percent of all the                births with at least one American Indian or Alaska Native parent listed the second                parent as White on the birth certificate (6,900); in 1994, it was 45 percent                (23,000).              Among births to Asian or Pacific Islander parents, the  percentage of births in                which the second parent was listed as White was 28 percent in 1968, about 32                percent between 1971 and 1979, and 26 percent in 1994.

Advocacy groups for multiracial persons have lobbied many State legislatures for laws to      add a multiracial category to all forms and applications used to collect information on      race and ethnicity.             Due at least in part to these advocacy efforts, Georgia, Indiana, and Michigan      require the use of a stand-alone multiracial category (Georgia since 1994 and Indiana and      Michigan since 1995).  In these States, the requirement applies to all State forms and      applications used to collect data on race and ethnicity, including health department forms.       Ohio and Illinois have similarly adopted legislation adding a multiracial category, but      these laws affect only school forms that collect data on race and ethnicity.  Florida and      North Carolina have added a multiracial category (by administrative directives) to school      forms that collect information on race and ethnicity.             At least nine other States are considering legislation to add a reporting category of      multiracial:  California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon,      Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.  In Maryland, a bill adding a multiracial category      was passed by the legislature in 1995, but was vetoed by the Governor; a task force has      been established to review the issue.             State laws enacted thus far specify that if a Federal agency does not accept the      multiracial data as a category, then the reporting State agency is to reclassify individuals      identified as multiracial to racial or ethnic classifications approved by the Federal agency      according to the racial and ethnic distribution of the general population.  The term      ""general population"" is not defined in the legislation.         3.5.2 Public Sentiment             Some advocacy groups support adding a category called ""multiracial.""  They      represent, for the most part, persons who identify themselves as multiracial, or persons      who want to identify their children as multiracial in cases where the parents are of      different races.  Some are highly critical of an approach that allows for the reporting of      only one racial category.  This approach, they say, forces children to deny the racial      heritage of one parent, thereby adversely affecting self-esteem, sense of family, pride, and      psychological well-being.  (OMB  Federal Register  Notice, 1995)             Public comment on how to allow for the reporting of more than one race has      ranged from suggestions for a specific category called ""multiracial""  (without further      specification of races) to a preference for identification by listing more than one race      (with or without a category called ""multiracial"").  (OMB  Federal  Register  Notice, 1995)              In some respects, the consequences of adding a multiracial category or of      providing an option to report more than one race might be minor.  At present, less than 2      percent of the general U. S. population identifies as ""multiracial"" when the category is      included as a response option.  Thus, it would be less disturbing to historical data series      to add a multiracial category soon, while the size of the population reporting would cause      only small changes in data series.  A decade or two from now, the multiracial population      will be larger and the disturbance to historical series correspondingly greater.         3.6  Measurement Concerns and Opportunities Related   to Reporting More Than One Race         3.6.1 Meeting Legislative and Program Needs             Many Federal agencies use data on race and ethnicity for policy development,      program evaluation, and civil rights monitoring and enforcement.  A number of these      agencies are concerned that adding a new multiracial category, or allowing individuals to      report more than one race, could affect the comparability and historical continuity of data      series that they rely on to meet their mandates or missions.  Some of the concern is      related to uncertainty about how the new data (if a new multiracial category were      provided) would be reported or how the multiple responses (if respondents were allowed      to report more than one race) would be tabulated.  For example, in the employment area,      representatives of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have      indicated that adding a multiracial category or using an instruction that permits reporting      more than one race could affect the historical comparability of data used for resolving      complaints and charges as well as for research, making it difficult particularly to analyze      trends.               Other Federal agencies that measure and report on various conditions suggest that      the interest in the reporting of multiracial information reflects a growing phenomenon      that will have to be addressed sooner or later.  In the health field, for example, it is      important to collect comprehensive data about the racial heritage of individuals.  Studies      have indicated that rates of low birth weight, very low birth weight, pre-term delivery,      and small-for-gestational-age -- key indicators of children's health status -- were highest      when both parents were Black, followed by rates for children with Black mother/White      father, White mother/Black father, and both parents White. (Carter-Pokras and LaViest,      1996)  In the context of health research, a Federal standard that permitted the reporting of      more than one race could better accommodate efforts to identify individuals at high risk      for certain medical conditions.             Another example of reporting more than one race is provided by the National      Health Interview Survey (NHIS) which since 1982 has been collecting responses on more      than one race through the use of a two- part question.  The first part allows respondents to      select the race or races with which they identify from among those listed on a hand card.       Persons who identify more than one race are given a follow-up question which asks them      to pick the race that best describes them, and the information from both questions is      entered into the person's electronic record.  In the surveys that were fielded through 1996,      only the first two races circled in the first question and the race that best described the      respondent are available for analysis.  (The 1997 redesign of the NHIS enables the      inclusion of up to five of the races reported in the first question, as well as the race that      best describes the respondent.)  For persons who reported multiple races, information on      the race that best describes them (i.e., that race obtained from the follow-up question) is      used to prepare statistics for NHIS publications.               However, an analysis of the data from the first NHIS question asked of multiracial      persons (see Table 3.11) revealed the following:              From 1982-1994, an average of 1.4 percent, nearly 1,500  persons out of a sample                of 100,000 per year, reported more than one race in the NHIS.  The annual                proportion of persons reporting multiple races ranged from 1.2 to 1.8 percent.              For persons reporting more than one race, the most commonly  reported                combination was White and Aleut, Eskimo, or American Indian (55 percent).              About 11.4 percent of respondents who reported more than one  race did not select                a single race that best represented their background.  This group represents 0.2                               percent of the total population.

                                                              1     Percentages may not add up to 100.0 percent because of  rounding or because                persons for whom the first and second reported races are in the same race category                are included in the total but not in the multiple-race column.         2     The count excludes persons for whom the first and second  reported races are in                          the same race category.         3     The count includes persons who reported a first,  second, and/or main race,                including those for whom the first and second reported race are in the same race                                         category.         3.6.2  Defining and Using the Term ""Multiracial""             A Federal standard adding a ""multiracial"" category would have to address issues      of terminology and definition as well as the issue of whether or not data on specific races      would be collected in addition.                 3.6.2.1  Definition of ""Multiracial""              In the five States that have enacted ""multiracial"" legislation, the laws call for use      of the term ""multiracial.""  (The same is true in several other States where legislation is      pending.)  Georgia, Indiana, and Michigan have defined ""multiracial"" as involving      parents of different races.  In pending legislation, California defines the term      ""multiracial"" as meaning an individual whose biological parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents are of more than one race.             The research findings on the terminology preferred by persons of more than one      race are inconclusive.  The May 1995 CPS Supplement on Race and Ethnicity indicates      that almost the same percentage of multiracial persons preferred the term ""multiracial""      (28.4 percent) as stated ""no preference"" (27.8 percent); ""Mixed race"" was preferred by      16.0 percent, ""More than one race"" by 6.0 percent, and ""Biracial"" by 5.7 percent.              Other evidence about terminology comes from a study sponsored by the National      Center for Health Statistics involving women whose parents were of different races.  The      mail and telephone survey interviewed 763 women, some of whom were of mixed racial      or Hispanic background, who had had a baby within the preceding three years.  Among      the respondents, 393 had parents of different races, 149 had one Hispanic parent, and 221      had parents who were either both Hispanic or non-Hispanic and who were of the same      race.  The study found that the women were more likely to enter two or more specific      races than to use a term like ""multiracial.""   (Cantor et al., 1997)             If the Federal standard were to provide for the use of a ""multiracial"" category, it      would be necessary not only to agree on the definition but also to communicate the      instructions clearly to respondents as well as interviewers.  More emphasis would need to      be placed on drafting instructions.  The experiences of the States in trying to define the      term and the data from the CPS Supplement and the NCS suggest that some confusion      exists about the meaning of ""multiracial.""  Absent a generally accepted understanding of      the term, confusion could be expected if a ""multiracial"" category were to be listed among      the response options.  Most Americans are probably of mixed ancestry, depending on      how ancestry is defined, and could confuse ancestry or ethnicity with race.  (Also see the      discussion in Chapter 4 regarding the concepts of race and ancestry, in regard to the      Hispanic population.)         3.6.2.2  Using a Stand-Alone ""Multiracial or Biracial"" Category or  Including a Follow-up Question             The research results indicate that between 1.0 and 1.5 percent of respondents      select a multiracial category when offered the opportunity to do so.  Providing an option      to report by means of a multiracial category with no follow-up question would be      responsive to persons who do not want to choose between their different racial heritages.       However, since respondents would not be asked to specify their races, it would not be      possible to tabulate the responses in the current categories.  Concerns about historical      continuity of data would not be addressed.  While refraining from such a tabulation      would be in keeping with self-identification, the responses would provide information of      limited utility, particularly for use in health research.             By contrast, a follow-up question would enable the data to be tabulated in the      current categories for purposes of historical continuity and trend analysis.  Further, with      the additional detail, the effects on data for certain groups could be minimized.  With a      follow-up question, research results suggest that a large percentage of  ""multiracial""      responses could be classified into the categories that have been used since 1977.              A related option would be to use a multiracial category with a write-in.   Doing so      would take up less space but require more coding than a follow-up question.  Conversely,      using a follow-up question that specified race categories would take up more space but      require less coding.             Another option involves the use of the ""Other race"" category, as in the decennial      census, with a multiracial example.  However, the use of this category is offensive to      some respondents, and multiracial individuals still would be unable to self-identity in the       manner they have requested.  With an ""Other race"" category, a greater amount of coding      would be required for the variety of responses.         3.6.3  Using a ""Mark One or More"" or a   ""Mark All That Apply"" Instruction in the Race Question             Approximately 0.5 percent of respondents to self-administered surveys, including      the 1990 census, already select more than one race, even when asked to select only one.       Allowing individuals to report more than one race could increase the accuracy of these      data, eliminate some inconsistencies in reporting of race, and improve response rates.             For many Federal agencies, the consequences of implementing the reporting of      more than one race could be expected to vary depending on the extent to which responses      could be tabulated consistently in accordance with existing racial categories that have      been used to meet current legislative mandates.  (National Research Council, 1996)  If      information from multiple responses can be tabulated to the current classifications, the      potential for disruption of historical series important to data users would likely be      reduced.  In particular, such disruption could be minimized if information from persons      who have marked multiple boxes could be used to tabulate responses in the race      categories currently specified in Directive No. 15.  Implementing ""mark one or more"" or      ""mark all that apply"" approaches would be less burdensome than having to code data      from write-ins. The CPS Supplement found that many people provided write-ins that      represented ethnicity rather than races, a factor that would unnecessarily increase      processing costs.  Either of the multiple response approaches could be expected to reduce      this type of misunderstanding about the information being asked.  Moreover, lengthy      definitions of  terms would not be needed, whereas if a ""multiracial"" category were used,      instructions would be needed and the wording of the instructions would be extremely      important.           3.6.4  Issues Related to Primary and Secondary Data Collections             In many cases, the Federal Government collects data through primary data      collections, as in censuses and longitudinal surveys.  In primary data collections, agencies      rely on essentially two methods for collecting information:  by self-identification or by      observer identification, which is based on the observer's perception of the most      appropriate category in which to report an individual.               With self-identification, individuals would be able to report multiracial      backgrounds.  In the case of observer identification, however, the observer would have      little basis for a realistic assessment of a person's racial background.  In this case, a      multiple race response option that called for identification of the particular races      (including instructions to ""mark all that apply"") could pose significant data quality      problems.  This is true today to some extent.  For example, American Indians who do not      live on or near a reservation are often classified as White or Hispanic.             In other instances, the Federal Government uses secondary data collection, as      when it obtains data from institutions and administrative records.  Examples include      aggregate data collected from colleges and universities on the race and ethnicity of      students or degree recipients, or on persons conducting research supported by Federal      grants.  Reporting could become more burdensome for institutions if individuals who      initially provide data to the university were using a multiple response approach.  The      primary collectors also would need guidance on how to aggregate the raw data into      categories specified in the Federal standard.         3.7  Some Implications of Allowing the Reporting of   More Than One Race         3.7.1  Possible Effects on Reporting by   Particular Population Groups             Data available from the CPS Supplement, the NCS, and the RAETT uniformly      indicate that adding a multiracial option--whether by means of a multiracial category or      providing for multiple-response options--had little effect on the numbers of people who      reported as White or as Black.  On the other hand, adding a multiracial category had a      substantial effect on the reporting in specific racial categories, such as the American      Indian (in the CPS Supplement) and the Alaska Native and the Asian and Pacific Islander      populations (in the NCS and the RAETT).  As noted in section 3.4.1, the Bureau of the      Census was able to tabulate substantial percentages of the multiracial responses in the      RAETT in the present Directive No. 15 categories using a procedure called the ""historical      series"" approach.  (However, there still may be some differences remaining.)  Whether      this ability to tabulate the data could apply in other contexts needs further investigation.             To the extent that providing a multiracial or a multiple-race response option can       change reporting, the affected population could experience some consequences.  In the      case of the American Indian population, for example, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and      the Indian Health Service provide assistance to persons who can prove descent from a      member of a federally recognized tribe.  Tribal governments have expressed concern that      the addition of a multiracial category could affect their ability to identify their members.      In the case of health statistics, adding a multiracial category could mean that fewer      American Indians/Alaska Natives would be counted for both numerators (number of      births to American Indian/Alaska Native mothers) and denominators (total number of      American Indian/Alaska Natives).  (Carter-Pokras, LaViest, 1996; Hahn, 1992)                3.7.2 Tabulation of Multiple Responses              Whether or not OMB modifies Directive No. 15, some respondents will report      more than one race.  It is important to ensure that the data are treated uniformly.       Accordingly, attention needs to be given to establishing rules for tabulating multiple       responses to the race question both for purposes of historical comparability and to ensure      consistency across Federal agencies.             An algorithm could be used to tabulate responses in the racial categories that are      used currently.  For example, one option would be to tabulate responses from a      multiracial category in proportion to the distributions for the current single-race      categories:  with a population of 80 Whites, 10 Asians, and 10 multiracial individuals, the      resulting numbers would be 89 Whites and 11 Asians.  This algorithm would not change      the relative sizes of the single-race categories.  However, the tabulation would be      arbitrary and could misrepresent the multiracial respondents (if for instance the 10      respondents in the multiracial category were the children of Asian/White unions).       (National Research Council, 1996)  Moreover, even if this method of tabulation would      suffice for some purposes, there are others in which it would be necessary to deal with     individual records.             Data from the decennial censuses suggest that the way in which children born into      interracial families are identified on the race item does not follow the race and ethnicity      distribution of the population.  Thus, no simple algorithm could assign a single race based      on the races of the parents that adequately matches the race now reported for the children.       For instance, while only 12 percent of the United States population is Black, 66 percent      of the children of Black and White unions have identified as Black in each census since      1970.             As discussed in section 3.4.1, the Census Bureau developed procedures to address      the reduced reporting of only a single race in the RAETT that occurred in some targeted      samples when a multiracial category or a multiple-race response option was offered.  An      algorithm is used in tabulating all multiple race responses.  The historical series approach      tabulates these responses to the Black, the American Indian and Alaska Native, or the      Asian and Pacific Islander category (and to the Hispanic category in two of the RAETT      panels).  When both the White box and either the ""Some other race"" or the ""multiracial""      box were marked, the responses were classified as White.  (The extent to which other      agencies might be able to implement a similar classification procedure would have to be      determined.)             This historical series approach tabulated a large percentage of the multiracial      responses in the Directive No. 15 categories.  The only targeted sample in which this      tabulation did not appear to produce results comparable to the single-race reporting in      Panel A was the Alaska Native targeted sample. The historical series noticeably increased      the percentages of American Indian and Alaska Native respondents on Panel B (which      included a multiracial category) and Panel H (which included a ""mark all that apply""      instruction); however, the percentages remained lower than on Panel A, which did not      offer a multiracial option.               In the cases of the decennial censuses, the Bureau of the Census has not tabulated       responses of ""Other Race"" in the categories specified by Directive No. 15.  As noted      above, however, the Bureau has developed an algorithm to create a Modified Age-Race-Sex (MARS) file that tabulates responses in the standard race categories to provide data      comparable to other statistical systems.             In some cases, the Federal Government already is dealing with the this tabulation      issue.  In Georgia, Indiana, and Michigan--where the multiracial legislation has general      applicability--the requirement to use a multiracial category affects the collection of data      on registration certificates for births and deaths and on health survey forms, and it thus      affects the reporting of both State and national statistics by race and ethnicity.  The      National Center for Health Statistics has created a ""multiracial"" code for vital records      from States that have passed such legislation.  Multiracial persons are coded by NCHS as      ""Other"" and, before analysis, all such entries are reallocated through an imputation      method to the standard race categories, consistent with Directive No. 15.  (Carter-Pokras,      LaViest, 1996)             A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education as part of the review of      Directive No. 15 found that when categories such as ""other"" or ""multiracial"" are used,      schools typically aggregate these data into the broad Federal category that is deemed      most appropriate by the school staff before reporting the information to the Federal      government.  (NCES 96-092)               3.7.3  Monetary Costs and Resource Burdens             Efforts were made to obtain estimates of monetary and other resource costs      associated with adding a multiracial response option, whether by adding a multiracial      category or by allowing for multiple responses to the race question.  Several agencies,      members of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics (COPAFS),      and State and local data users belonging to the Association of Public Data Users (APDU)      provided views.             Some data collections generally would be more costly and difficult if a multiracial      category were added (particularly if the changes included a combined format for Hispanic      ethnicity).  There could be significant costs associated with the disaggregation of the      multiracial category into meaningful population groups for enforcement purposes and      comparability with a large volume of historical data.  Instructions that allowed counting      individuals according to more than one race/ethnic group could make it extremely      difficult to perform trend analysis.  Agencies noted that some of these costs would be      ongoing rather than one-time costs.             Costs associated with adding an option to report multiple races could be expected      to vary depending on the reporting technique used.  If a multiracial category involved a      write-in option, for instance, and the responses were assigned to the major groups, the      costs for editing and coding entries could be higher than those for fixed categories.       Classification algorithms would have to be written, tested, and harmonized across      agencies.  Further, coding write-in responses could prove more feasible for major      statistical agencies with large data processing resources, such as the Bureau of the      Census, than for agencies where the collection of racial and ethnic data is only a small         portion of their  administrative mandate.              In an informal consultation with BLS staff, COPAFS members suggested that in      some cases a change in Directive No. 15 would probably mean only minor effects on data      systems, Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing software, and sample management      systems.  Participants in the discussion noted that a variety of computer-based analytic      tools would have to be reprogrammed.  In cases where general requirements for data      collection apply, changes in industry-wide forms (paper and electronic), electronic data      transfer conventions, and computer programs would be needed.  Estimates of time range      from two to three weeks to reprogram and one to two months to re-estimate models.             COPAFS members also were asked about data systems or software that the      organizations would have to revise to accommodate a change.  The responses ranged      from ""only minor changes would be needed"" to ""significant changes would be required.""       Members also noted that changing only the nomenclature from that used in Directive 15      would have little effect on cost.  However, adding an ""Other race"" or a multiracial      category would be both disruptive and costly.  Members said the changes would affect      Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing software, forms, electronic reporting      systems, and resulting databases.  The cost would be associated with disaggregating the      multiracial category into meaningful groups for enforcement purposes and comparability      with a large volume of historical data.  Survey processing costs would increase due to the      additional editing, coding, and keying of the expanded matrices, and due to the need to      redesign the processing systems to account for the additional data.  (Tucker, COPAFS,      1996)  One participant said the modifications would be handled as part of the massive      transition from the 1990 Census to the 2000 census, describing the overall process that      occurs once each decade as an arduous one that could be made more complicated by        changes to the racial and ethnic categories.              In a meeting with data users from State and local organizations, participants      appeared not too concerned about adapting to change.  Unless no changes are made to the      decennial census, participants noted, they have to rewrite their data analysis programs      every ten years--in any event--to conform to the new formats.  Participants believed that      costs would not be affected to any great extent.  (Tucker, APDU, 1996).  Most      participants ultimately favored an option that would allow for multiple responses to the      race question.  While recognizing that it would require more work for analysts and data      providers, they believed it to be the fairest alternative given our Nation's diverse      population.  They thought it could be a viable solution, but also expressed interest in      having the Federal Government develop  rules for tabulating multiple race responses.       (Tucker, APDU group, 1996)             Several agencies offered dollar estimates for what it would cost to implement a      change in Federal standards that provided for the reporting of more than one race.  These      ranged from the tens of thousands into the millions of dollars, depending on the approach      that might be selected and whether and the extent to which updating of records might be                             required.      CHAPTER 4.  A Combined Race and Hispanic Origin  Question    4.1 Background             This chapter addresses the issue of whether there should be a combined      race/Hispanic origin question or whether there should be a separate race question and a      separate Hispanic origin question.  Included in this chapter is a summary of findings from      research recently conducted the Bureau of Labor Statistics and by the Bureau of the      Census on the effects of using a combined format instead of separate questions.  The      chapter also presents findings from other relevant research that address the issues      associated with a combined format versus separate questions.  These issues include      concerns about data quality that arise when a separate race question and an Hispanic      origin question are used, and approaches that have been tested to address these data      quality concerns.             Directive No. 15 calls for collection of information on persons of Spanish origin      or culture.  This information can be collected using two different formats--either a      combined race and Hispanic origin question or two separate questions, one for race and      one for Hispanic origin.  Both approaches are popular among Federal agencies.  The      Directive also allows Federal agencies to collect data on race and Hispanic origin using      separate questions and then to present the data in the combined format.             Even within the same agency, both formats sometimes are used.  For example,      almost six out of every ten (56 out of 97) data systems listed in the Directory of Minority      Health and Human Services Data Resources which collect information on Hispanic origin      do so using the separate format (Department of Health and Human Services, 1995).       Slightly more than half (8 out of 15) of the principal data collections at the Department of      Justice use the combined format.  At the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of      Labor, some of the surveys use a combined format while others use two separate      questions.  The Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education, the Office of      Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services, the Equal Employment      Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) use      the combined format.  In its National Health Interview Survey, the National Center for      Health Statistics (NCHS) uses two questions for race (check one or more groups,      followed by selection of the group which best represents the person's race), and one      question for Hispanic origin.  The combined format tends to be preferred for data      collections using observer identification.             Briefly, according to the Directive,  if data on race and ethnicity are collected      using two separate questions, the racial categories are:             --American Indian or Alaskan Native            --Asian or Pacific Islander                        --Black                --White                         And, for ethnicity:             --Hispanic origin            --Not of Hispanic origin         If the combined format is used, the categories are:             -- American Indian or Alaskan Native             --Asian or Pacific Islander            --Black, not of Hispanic origin              --Hispanic            --White, not of Hispanic origin        The separate questions are designed to provide Hispanic origin information for all      persons.  The combined format does not allow for collection of Hispanic origin data if a      person reports in the American Indian or Alaskan Native category, or in the Asian or      Pacific Islander category.   When a combined question is used, data on the race of      Hispanics is not collected (see OMB Federal Register Notice, June 1994).         4.2 Concepts of Race and Ethnicity             The decennial census categories used to classify data on ""race"" and ""ethnicity""      have changed depending on what were considered the population groups of interest.  In      the 20th century, data on race and ethnicity have sometimes been coded together and at      other times have been coded separately.  Census researchers Bates, de la Puente, DeMaio,      and Martin (1994) have characterized as ""official ambivalence"" the Federal uncertainty      ""about whether Spanish-speaking groups should be considered a separate race, or not.""       For example, the census classified Mexicans as a ""race"" in 1930, ""White"" during 1940-1970, and ""of any race"" they chose in 1980 and 1990.  In 1940, persons of Spanish      mother tongue were reported.  In 1950 and 1960, persons of Spanish surname were      recorded.  By 1960, all Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and other persons of ""Latin descent""      were counted as ""White"" unless they were ""definitely Negro, Indian, or some other race      (as determined by observation).""  In 1970, a separate question on Hispanic origin was      added to the census long form (sent to one-sixth of households).  In 1980 and 1990, a      separate question on Hispanic origin was asked of all households.              Directive No. 15 defines ""race"" and ""ethnicity"" as separate concepts.  Harry Scarr,      then Acting Director of the U.S. Bureau of the Census, stated in his testimony to the      Congressional Subcommittee on Census, Statistics and Postal Personnel in April 1993,      that although the Bureau treated race and ethnicity as two separate concepts, the ""Bureau      recognizes that the concepts are not mutually exclusive..."" (Scarr, 1994:7).  Dr. Scarr's      observation has been well documented in the research literature.             Opinion researchers report that respondents in general--not only Hispanics--find      questions about ""race"" and ""ethnicity"" to be among the most difficult to answer. Tom      Smith of the National Opinion Research Center concludes, ""Of all basic background      variables, ethnicity is probably the most difficult to measure"" (Smith, 1983).  Although      respondents may give different answers to questions about each concept, researchers have      observed that respondents do not understand conceptual differences among terms such as      ""race,"" ""ethnicity,"" and others such as ""ancestry"" or ""national origin.""  For example,      NCHS reports that interviewers for one of their surveys found that ""...the phrase 'origin or      descent' was poorly understood by many respondents."" (Drury, 1980).  Researchers at the      Bureau of the Census remark that notions of ""race,"" ""ethnicity,"" and ""ancestry"" are not      clearly distinguished from one another by census respondents and some persons perceive      the race, Hispanic origin, and ancestry questions as asking for the same information.             The terms ""race"" and ""ethnicity"" are frequently used interchangeably in the      United States.  For most daily and practical applications, Hispanics are considered a race.       Definitions of race and ethnicity in major dictionaries often have considerable overlap.       Crews and Bindon (1991) suggest that race is a sociological construct that is poorly      correlated with any measurable biological or cultural phenomenon other than the amount      of melanin in an individual's skin. Ethnicity, they suggest, is a sociocultural construct that      is often, if not always, coextensive with discernible features of a group of individuals.      Crews and Bindon cite several human biologists who have advocated vigorously for use      of the term ""ethnic group"" instead of ""race"" to question hypotheses about the genetic and      cultural constituency of groups.             This fluid demarcation between the concepts of ""race"" and ""ethnicity"" and the      notion that these concepts are a sociocultural construct observed among the general      population is also applicable to the Hispanic population.  In fact, researchers such as      Clara Rodriguez (1992) have noted that this view of race and ethnicity is consistent with      the views of many Hispanics.  Numerous other researchers have concluded that the      racially diverse Hispanic population regards their ""Hispanic"" identity as a ""racial"" one.        This view of race and ethnicity among Hispanics has its origins in Latin American culture.  For example, Rodriguez (1994) observes that in Latin America, there are a greater number of racial terms for ""intermediate"" categories.  In contrast, the emphasis in the United States has been on constructing ""pure"" races (e.g., Black and White, and not biracial or multiracial terms).  Conceptions of race in Latin America result in the use of more categories since they are based more on ethnicity, national origin, and culture than appearance.  Recent studies have found that Hispanics tend to see race as a continuum and use cultural frames of reference when discussing race (e.g., see Bracken and de Bango, 1992; Romero, 1992; Rodriguez and Hagan, 1991).          Unlike the United States where racial formation has evolved from the acceptance and legitimization of the ""one-drop"" rule, if a person looked ""White"" in Latin America, then this is what they were, regardless of what their ancestors may have looked like or how much blood of a particular non-White group they may have.  Race in the Caribbean and Latin America is often viewed as an individual marker, while in the United States it determines one's reference group (Wright, 1994).  Latin American countries tend to have a more social view of race as compared with the genealogically based view in the United States.  This more social view of race tends to include other physical and social characteristics besides color (e.g., education, social class, and context), and may lead to overlapping categories and different racial taxonomies (Rodriguez and Cordero-Guzman, 1992; Harris et al., 1993).         4.3 Self-Identification             Studies indicate differences between the racial and ethnic classification assessed      by self-identification and (1) proxy identification by other household members, family, or      friends, (2) identification by research or survey interviewers, and (3) identification by the      personnel of institutions such as funeral homes.  Several studies concentrate on the      identification of Hispanic origin, while others focus more broadly on the identification of      racial and/or ethnic groups, including Hispanics.  Substantial differences have been found      between how Hispanics identify themselves and how they are identified by interviewers      (Rodriguez and Cordero-Guzman, 1992; Falcon, 1994; Tumin and Feldman, 1961;      Rodriguez, 1974; Ginorio, 1979; Ginorio and Berry, 1972; Martinez, 1988).               Hahn, Truman, and Barker (1996) examined the consistency of self-perceived      identification at first interview and proxy-reported ancestry at a follow-up interview (an      average of 10 years later) in the U.S. population.  Ten percent of household proxies did      not know the backgrounds of sample persons.  Proxy reports of ancestry were consistent      with self-classification for 55 percent of sample persons.  Consistent classification      between proxy and sample person was highest for sample persons classifying themselves      as Mexican (98 percent); for other Hispanic groups, consistency was 70 percent .       Overall, consistency between self- and proxy-identification was high for several      European populations, for Asians, and for Hispanics, but low for American Indians.                In another study comparing self- and interviewer-identification (Drury,  Moy, and      Poe 1980), researchers compared respondents' self-identified ancestry, including      Hispanic categories as well as races, with classification at the same time by an observer      (as White, Black, or other).  Among self-identified Hispanic groups, between 86 percent      and 100 percent were identified by interviewers as White, the remainder as Black or      other.  A more recent study of the U.S. population (Hahn, Truman, and Barker 1996)      compared respondents' self-identified ancestry with race as determined by the      interviewer.  Among respondents who self-identified as Mexican, 95 percent were      classified as White, 5 percent as other; among respondents who self-identified as      members of other Hispanic populations, 84 percent were classified as White, 15 percent      as Negro.  Overall, studies consistently indicate that interviewers are effective in      identifying Whites and Blacks, moderately effective in identifying the members of      Hispanic groups, and poor in identifying Asians and American Indians.               Other studies have focused on identification by personnel of institutions such as      funeral homes. Hahn, Mulinare, Teutsch (1992) compared the race and ethnicity on the      birth and death certificates of all U.S. infants born from 1983 through 1985 who died      within a year.  Among infants designated as Hispanic at birth, 20 percent of Mexicans, 48      percent of Puerto Ricans, and 67 percent of Cubans were likely to have another      designation at death; for all Hispanic infants who had different designations on birth and      death certificates, more than half were classified as non-Hispanic (White or Black) on      death certificates.    Observer identification may result in underestimation of mortality for      some racial and ethnic groups.  For example, when data on Hispanic origin from the birth      certificate was used instead of the death certificate, estimates of Hispanic infant mortality      were 8.9 percent higher than those based on the death certificate (Hahn 1992).             Similar discrepancies have been reported for U.S. adults.  Poe et. al., (1993) found      that Hispanics were misclassified as non-Hispanic on 19 percent of death certificates.       Other studies have also found significant misclassification of Hispanics (Sorlie 1993;      Lindan 1990; Massey 1980).           4.4 Some Alternative Formats for Questions             Several alternative formats for questions to collect data on Hispanic origin have      been suggested in public comments.  Directive No. 15 currently allows two formats for      questions on race and ethnicity: a combined format option (referred to as Alternative 1 for      the discussion in this section), and two separate questions (Alternatives 2 and 3).        Hispanic can be chosen independently of race only when it is a separate question.      Alternative 1: Combined format (allowed under Directive No. 15)             --American Indian or Alaskan Native            --Asian or Pacific Islander            --Black, Not of Hispanic Origin             --Hispanic            --White, Not of Hispanic Origin        Alternative 2: Two separate questions with race question first (allowed under Directive      No. 15)             --American Indian or Alaskan Native            --Asian or Pacific Islander            --Black            --White                 --Hispanic origin            --Not of Hispanic origin        Alternative 3: Two separate questions with Hispanic origin question first (Allowed under      Directive No. 15)             --Hispanic origin            --Not of Hispanic origin         --American Indian or Alaskan Native            --Asian or Pacific Islander            --Black            --White        The following two formats are commonly used outside the Federal Government:      Alternative 4:             --American Indian or Alaska Native            --Asian or Pacific Islander             --Black            --Hispanic             --White        Alternative 5:             --Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native            --Non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander            --Non-Hispanic Black            --Hispanic            --Non-Hispanic White        Variations of these have also been suggested in public comments.  For example, some      suggested that a ""multiracial"" category could be followed by a list of categories to select,      or a line could be provided to specify the categories. Another alternative which was tested      in the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test combined the concepts of race, ethnicity, and      ancestry in a two-part single question.         4.5 Research on Data Quality             This section summarizes research that has examined the quality of data on race      and Hispanic origin obtained through a separate question for race and a separate question      for Hispanic origin.  The major data quality measures examined by this research include      the reporting of ""other race"" by Hispanics (section 4.5.1), item nonresponse for race      (section 4.5.2), item nonresponse for Hispanic origin (section 4.5.3), and inconsistent      reporting in both the race and Hispanic-origin items (section 4.5.4). The chapter then      turns to measures that have been proposed and tested for addressing the data quality      concerns just cited (section 4.5.6).         4.5.1 Reporting in the ""Other Race"" Category by Hispanics             Evaluations of the results from the 1980 Census, the 1980 Current Population      Survey, the 1990 Census, the 1990 Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the 1991      Current Population Survey have shown that approximately 40 percent of Hispanics select      the ""Other Race"" category (Denton and Massey, 1989; Tienda and Ortiz 1986; Rodriguez      1992).  Research also shows that the use of the ""Other Race"" category varies by Hispanic      subgroup and geography (Rodriguez, 1989; Tucker et al., 1996).  Almost all (98 percent)      of respondents who classified themselves as ""Other Race"" in the 1990 Census were      Hispanic (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1993:26).  This has raised concern among      researchers that Hispanics do not identify with the racial categories usually offered.       Reporting in the ""Other Race"" category by Hispanics occurs because, as noted earlier,      some Hispanics do not identify with the major race groups.  For this reason these      members of the Hispanic population report in the ""Other Race"" category and many      register their Hispanic origin in the ""Other Race"" write-in line when available.  (For      example, see Kissam et al.,  1993).  In the 1996 National Content Survey, between 25      percent and 43 percent of Hispanics reported in the ""Other Race"" category depending on      whether the Hispanic origin question was placed before or after the race question      (Harrison et al., 1996).         4.5.2 Item Nonresponse in the Race Question             Relatively high item nonresponse to the race question among Hispanics is another      reporting issue associated with the use of a separate question to collect information on      Hispanic origin and race.  The item nonresponse to the race question varies depending on      the mode of data collection.  In self-administered surveys such as the 1996 National      Content Survey (NCS), the item nonresponse rate for the race question is much higher      than in interviewer-administered surveys.  For example, in the NCS, the item      nonresponse rate for the race question ranged from 1.1 percent to 2.2 percent for non-Hispanics, and from 31 percent to 36.5 percent for Hispanics.  (Harrison et al., 1996).  In       interviewer-administered surveys, item nonresponse to the race question is much lower.       For example, item nonresponse for the race question in the 1994 National Health      Interview Survey was 0.4 percent, and on the Current Population Survey, less than one      tenth of one percent of Hispanics were missing information on race.          4.5.3 Item Nonresponse in the Hispanic Origin Question             The General Accounting Office concluded that ""the results from the 1990 census      showed that the Hispanic origin item continues to pose one of the more significant data      quality challenges for the Bureau in terms of allocation rate"" (GAO, 1993:24).  The      Hispanic origin question had the highest nonresponse rate of any question of the 1980      and 1990 censuses, suggesting that some people regarded the question as not applicable,      redundant, or unclear.  Information was missing from 10 percent of the 1990 census short      forms (McKenney, 1992).  For the more detailed sample questionnaires, the allocation      rate for nonresponse was 3.5 percent .  Non-Hispanic respondents contributed      substantially to the high nonresponse rate for the Hispanic origin item.  The 1990 Content      Reinterview Survey found that 94 percent of non-respondents to the Hispanic origin item      were non-Hispanic.             In the Census Bureau's 1996 National Content Survey, item nonresponse to the      Hispanic origin question ranged from 5.2 percent to 8.6 percent depending on whether the      Hispanic origin question was placed before or after the race question (Harrison et al.,      1996).             Item nonresponse to the Hispanic origin item is considerably lower in interviewer-administered surveys than in self-administered surveys.  For example, the item      nonresponse  rate from the Current Population Survey for the Hispanic origin variable      was 0.6 percent for the first 6 months of 1995.  In the 1994 National Health Interview      Survey, Hispanic origin was missing for 1.2 percent of sample persons.  On the other      hand, some data systems that collect information based on observer-identification have      considerably higher nonresponse for the Hispanic origin data items.  Examples include 15      percent for the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 30 percent for the      National Home and Hospice Care Survey, and 75 percent for the National Hospital      Discharge Survey, all conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. (DHHS,      1995).         4.5.4 Reporting Inconsistency             The General Accounting Office concluded that ""the Content Reinterview Survey      for the 1990 Census showed generally good response consistency for both the race and      Hispanic origin questions"" (GAO, 1993, p. 22).  However, of  those who said they were      ""Other Hispanic,"" only 64 percent answered similarly in the reinterview study.  In the      race question, only 36 percent of those who said on the Census form that they were of      ""Other Race"" reported similarly when reinterviewed.  Those reporting as American      Indians also were more likely to change their response.  Reporting race generally was less      consistent for multiple-race persons, Hispanics, foreign-born persons, and persons who      did not read or speak English well (OMB Federal Register Notice, 1995: 44675).             The 1996 National Content Survey compared responses from mailback survey      forms to the responses provided in the telephone reinterview (Harrison et al., 1996).       Approximately 3 percent of Hispanics reported inconsistently on the mailback survey      forms and telephone reinterview when two separate questions on race and ethnicity were      used.  Using an Hispanic origin question first with no multiracial category, 2.9 percent of      Hispanics reported inconsistently.  Inconsistency was not reduced for Hispanics when the      order of the questions on race and Hispanic origin was changed (2.9 percent).  Among      Hispanics, inconsistency was highest (3.8 percent) when Hispanic origin was asked first      and the race question included a multiracial category.  Use of a multiracial category in the      1996 National Content Survey did not have a statistically significant effect on the      consistency with which persons reported Hispanic origin (Harrison et al., 1996).               Information on reporting consistency is also available from other surveys.  For      example, Hahn, Truman and Barker (1996) found that 58 percent of respondents to the      first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and subsequent Epidemiologic      Follow-up Study were consistent in self-classification over the follow-up period.  In      another study Johnson et al. (1995:15) found that 40 percent of mixed-race and Hispanic      respondents changed the way they reported their racial and ethnic background depending      on the context, social situation, options on application forms or ""perceived advantages in      applying for scholarships, loans, school admissions, housing and employment.""  Changes      in self-awareness and identification were also responsible for changes in reported      identity.  Hispanics with two Hispanic parents were much less likely (12.5 percent) to      have ever identified themselves differently.        4.6  Measures to Correct Misreporting in the Race Question and the Hispanic      Origin Question             The reporting issues just described -- reporting in the ""Other race"" category, item      nonresponse to the race question, item nonresponse to the Hispanic origin question, and      inconsistency of reporting -- result from having a separate race and a separate Hispanic      origin question.  Two important measures have been used and tested to address these      reporting concerns while keeping two separate questions:  placement of the Hispanic      origin question before the race question, and providing respondents with written      instructions to respond to both the race question and the Hispanic origin question.              Bates, de la Puente, Martin and DeMaio (1994) analyzed and summarized      multiple replications of five major Census Bureau studies on decennial census race and      Hispanic origin questions to determine the effects of question order and instructions on      reporting in the race question and the Hispanic origin question.  Based on this analysis      and on qualitative information obtained through focus groups and in-depth personal      interviews, the authors conclude that the evidence consistently shows that placement of      the Hispanic origin question before the race question provides a more restrictive frame of      reference for race reporting and thus respondents (mostly Hispanics) are less likely to      report in the ""Other Race"" category and more likely to select one of the major race groups      listed in the race question.  Further, restricting the frame of reference for race reporting      also results in reductions in item nonresponse to the race question.  Although these      measures substantially reduced reporting in the ""Other Race"" category, reduced item      nonresponse for the race question among Hispanics, and reduced item nonresponse to the      Hispanic origin questions by non-Hispanics, these measures did not entirely eliminate the      reporting problems.             For example, in the National Content Survey,  ""Other Race""  reporting by      Hispanics went from 40 percent when the race question was placed before the Hispanic      origin question down to 20 percent when the Hispanic origin question was placed before      the race question.  The comparable percentages in the Appeals and Long Form      Experiment were 53 percent when the race question was placed before the Hispanic      origin question and 26 percent when the Hispanic origin question was placed before the      race question. The declines in ""Other Race"" reporting by Hispanics in the other three      Census Bureau studies were more modest.  (Bates et al., 1994).             Bates, de la Puente, Martin, and DeMaio (1994) report that the inclusion of      instructions to aid reporting had positive effects.  For example, the Alternative      Questionnaire Experiment (AQE) used a two-question format to gather data on race and      Hispanic origin, and included an instruction in some panels that read ""Fill in the NO      circle if not Spanish/Hispanic"" next to the question text on Hispanic origin.  Results from      the AQE demonstrate that adding this instruction alone reduced nonresponse to the      Hispanic origin question from 19 percent to 8 percent.  Combining the instruction with      asking the ethnicity question prior to race resulted in a nonresponse rate of 5 percent.       These findings suggest that instructions can help reduce, but not eliminate, nonresponse      to the Hispanic origin question.             Bates, de la Puente, Martin and DeMaio (1994) also conducted multivariate      analyses to improve understanding of the effects of question order and instructions on      race reporting by Hispanics.  Four variables hypothesized to affect race reporting by      Hispanics were included in the analyses:  place of birth (native or foreign-born), recency      of arrival in the United States, educational level, and English proficiency.  The results      from the multivariate analyses are mixed.  The authors concluded that the effect of      question ordering on the reporting of race among Hispanics does not seem to be      influenced by time in the United States, education, or knowledge of English.  The authors      added that data from at least two of the five Census Bureau studies considered indicated      that Hispanic response to the race question may be conditioned by recency of arrival in      the United States (Bates et al., 1994).             Unlike the Census Bureau tests examined in the Bates, de la Puente, Martin and      DeMaio (1994) study, the 1996 National Content Survey also examined the effects of      sequencing on the reporting of race and Hispanic origin using race questions that      provided a ""multiracial"" category as one of the response options.  Findings from this test      are in line with the results reported by Bates et al. (1994).               In the 1996 National Content Survey panels where the race question did not      include a multiracial category as a response option, ""Other Race"" reporting by Hispanics      significantly declined from about 43 percent when the Hispanic origin question was      placed after the race question to approximately 25 percent when the Hispanic origin      question was placed before the race question.  ""Other Race"" reporting also declined      among Hispanics when the Hispanic origin question was placed before the race question      that included a multiracial category as a response option, but the decline was not      statistically significant.  In panels where the race question included a multiracial response      option, reporting of ""Other Race"" by Hispanics declined from about 33 percent when the      Hispanic origin question was placed after the race question to about 25 percent when the      Hispanic origin question was placed before the race question (Harrison et al., 1996).  It is      important to note that these declines in ""other race"" reporting were reduced, but not      eliminated, by reversing the order of the Hispanic origin and race questions.             Placing the Hispanic origin question before the race question in the 1996 National      Content Survey reduced item nonresponse rates for the race question among Hispanics,      but these reductions were not statistically significant and item nonresponse rates for the      race question remained relatively high (Harrison et al., 1996).             The sequencing of the Hispanic origin question and the race question was also one      of the major research objectives of the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test (RAETT).  The      findings from the RAETT on this issue echo those of studies just discussed.  In the      Hispanic targeted sample, asking the Hispanic origin question before the race question      reduced item nonresponse to the Hispanic origin question from about 10 percent to about      7 percent.  Placing the Hispanic origin question before the race question had no effect on      the item nonresponse rate for the race question in the Hispanic targeted sample.             In the RAETT, reductions in the reporting as ""Other Race"" and ""Multiracial"" and      an increase in the reporting as ""White"" in the Hispanic targeted sample were detected      when the Hispanic origin question was asked before the race question.  More specifically,      in the Hispanic targeted sample in Panel D (race question first), about 56 percent of      respondents reported as White, about 25 percent reported as ""Other Race"", and about 3      percent reported as ""Multiracial.""  In contrast, when the Hispanic origin question was      placed before the race question (Panel B), approximately 67 percent reported as White, 16      percent reported as ""Other Race"", and 2 percent reported as ""Multiracial.""          4.7  The Effects of Combining the Race Question and   the Hispanic Origin Question into a Single Question             A combined question on race and Hispanic origin was tested in the 1995 CPS      Supplement and in the RAETT.         4.7.1 Results From the May 1995 CPS Supplement  on Race and Ethnic Origin              Having a separate versus combined race and ethnicity question appears to have a      significant effect on the percentage of persons who identify as Hispanic.  In the May 1995      Current Population Survey (CPS) Supplement, significantly more people identified as      Hispanic when they were asked a separate question on Hispanic origin than when      Hispanic origin was combined with the race question (See Table 4.1).  (Because an      interviewer collects the data, either in person or by telephone, multiple responses are      much less likely to occur.)  In particular, 10.6 percent of the respondents who received a      separate question (panels 1 and 2 combined from Table 4.1) identified as Hispanic      compared with 8.1 percent of the respondents who were given the combined race and           ethnic origin question (panels 3 and 4 combined from  Table 4.1), (Tucker et al., 1996).      Table 4.1.

From  Table 3, Tucker, et al. (1996).          Additionally, it is important to note that some specific Hispanic subgroups may      respond differently than others to separate race and ethnicity questions versus a combined      race and ethnicity question (See Table 4.2).  In particular, the proportions of respondents      who report Mexican, Cuban, and ""Other Hispanic"" national origins differed significantly      depending on the type of race and ethnicity question.  Specifically, the respondents who      identify as Hispanic in a combined race and ethnicity question (as in panels 3 and 4      combined from Table 4.2) are composed of a greater percentage of people with Mexican      national origin (66 percent) than the respondents who identify as Hispanic in a separate      ethnicity question (about 60 percent in panels 1 and 2 combined from Table 4.2).  In      contrast, the respondents who identify as Hispanic in a separate question are composed of      a greater percentage of people with Cuban and ""Other Hispanic"" national origins (about 4      percent Cuban and 13 percent ""Other Hispanic"" in panels 1 and 2 combined from Table      4.2) than the respondents who identified as Hispanic from the combined race and      ethnicity question (about 2 percent Cuban and 9 percent ""Other Hispanic"" in panels 3 and      4 combined from Table 4.2).  In other words, Hispanics of different national origins differ      in how likely they are to identify themselves as Hispanic depending upon whether they      are asked a separate Hispanic question or a combined race and Hispanic origin question      (Tucker et al., 1996).

From Table 11, Tucker, et al. (1996).           In the May 1995 CPS supplement, analyses of the effect of a separate versus      combined race and ethnicity question showed that there were no significant differences in      the percentage of people identifying as Black, Asian or Pacific Islander, or American      Indian (See Table 4.3).  However, the number of American Indians in the sample was too      small for drawing reliable conclusions for that population.  The percentage of people      identifying as White was influenced by whether there was a separate Hispanic question or      not, with 75.22 percent (panels 3 and 4 combined from Table 4.3) of the respondents      identifying as White when Hispanic was included in the list of races compared with 79.81      percent who identified as White when Hispanic origin was a separate question (panels 1      and 2 combined from Table 4.3).  Thus, including Hispanic as a category in the race      question will likely lower the proportion of people currently identifying as White only      and the proportion of persons classified as ""Other.""  These findings were also reflected in      the analysis of the differences in respondent reporting between the CPS race question and            the May 1995 CPS Supplement race questions (see Tucker et al., 1996).

By using respondents' Hispanic national origin from the CPS and examining their      racial identification in the May 1995 CPS Supplement, further insights are gained into      how subgroups of Hispanics identify depending upon whether they are asked separate      race and ethnicity questions or a combined race and ethnicity question (See Table 4.4).       As can be seen in Table 4.4, a sizeable percentage of respondents with Hispanic national      origins do not identify as Hispanic in a combined race and ethnicity question (panels 3      and 4).  Specifically, 11 percent of respondents with a Mexican national origin identified      as White when having to choose between White and Hispanic in the combined race and      ethnicity question.  Similarly, 23 percent of respondents with other Hispanic national      origins identified as White when there was a combined race and ethnicity question and a      majority of respondents of Cuban origin identified as White even though the Hispanic      category was offered in the combined question (Tucker et al., 1996).  This pattern of      racial identification for Mexican-origin and Cuban-origin respondents is consistent with      the findings of the 1990 Panel Study of Income Dynamics conducted by the Institute for      Survey Research at the University of Michigan.  For Hispanics reporting a single race      when given a list of racial categories that included ""Latino,"" 88 percent of Cubans      reported as White and 9 percent as Latino, compared with Mexicans, 56 percent of whom      reported as White and 35 percent of whom reported as Latino (Duncan et al., 1992).       Bates, et al. (1996) found that Cubans, compared with other Hispanic groups, were most      likely to report their race as White when the race question followed a question on           Hispanic origin.

Both versions provided check boxes for ""White,"" for ""Black,      African Am., or Negro,"" for ""Indian (Amer.) or Alaska Native"" (with a write-in line for      tribal affiliation), for ""Asian or Pacific Islander,"" for ""Hispanic"" and for ""Some other      race.""  One version (Panel E) also included the category ""Multiracial or biracial.""  A      second version (Panel F) did not contain a multiracial category but rather instructed      respondents to ""Mark one or more boxes to indicate what this person considers      himself/herself to be.""  Both versions, E and F, were followed by a question which asked      respondents to write in their ""ancestry or ethnic group"" in the space provided.             Panels E and F were compared with the corresponding panels that contained a      separate race question and a separate Hispanic origin question.  These were Panel B      (containing a multiracial category like Panel E) and Panel C (containing a multiple      response option like Panel F). The major findings from these panel comparisons are      presented below.         4.7.2.1.  Reporting of Hispanic Origin             A combined race and Hispanic origin question must, of necessity, produce fewer      Hispanic only responses or fewer responses in at least one of the major race groups, than      a separate race question and a separate Hispanic origin question.  If all individuals who      select the Hispanic category alone or in combination with another race group are      tabulated as Hispanic (termed ""all-inclusive Hispanic""), such a tabulation could provide      similar information to that which would be obtained if separate questions on race and      Hispanic origin were used.               The RAETT found no statistically significant differences between the ""all-inclusive Hispanic"" tabulation for the combined question on panels E and F and the      appropriate panels containing a separate Hispanic origin question and a separate race      question.  Specifically, panels B and E, which both contained a multiracial category, and      panels C and F, which both contained the instruction to ""mark one or more,"" all had      responses ranging from 74 percent to 76 percent.  However, if one were to tabulate as      Hispanic those who selected only the Hispanic category, then a much lower percent      (about 57 percent) of responses would be Hispanic in panels E and F.             Table 4.5 shows that the percentages reporting the specific Hispanic origins      Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban and Other were quite different on panels E and F than on      panels A, B, and C.  This is most likely an artifact of the way the data were collected and      tabulated.  In panels A, B, and C, respondents were asked to check boxes with the labels      shown in Table 4.5.  In panels E and F, respondents were asked in a separate question to      write in their ancestry or ethnic group.  These write-in groups were tabulated (for those      who marked only the Hispanic category) and are shown in table 4.5.   Those who      consider themselves both Hispanic and something else are not included in counts shown      for the specific Hispanic origins for panels E and F; they are included only in ""Hispanic      (only or in combination).""  In addition, if Hispanic only respondents wrote in two      different Hispanic origins they are counted in ""other Hispanic"" in Panels E and F.  In      panels A, B, and C, the instructions appeared to ask Hispanic respondents to select one      Hispanic origin category, although some may have marked multiple categories.  A      tabulation using the ""historic series"" approach or the ""all-inclusive"" approach would shed           additional light on this issue.

GX080-51-8291062	OVERVIEW     Current Population Survey        Introduction    The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of the official Government statistics on employment and unemployment.  The CPS has been conducted monthly for over 50 years.  Currently, we interview about 47,000 households monthly, scientifically selected on the basis of area of residence to represent the Nation as a whole, individual States, and other specified areas.  Each household is interviewed once a month for four consecutive months one year, and again for the corresponding time period a year later.  This technique enables us to obtain month-to-month and year-to-year comparisons at a reasonable cost while minimizing the inconvenience to any one household.   Although the main purpose of the survey is to collect information on the employment situation, a very important secondary purpose is to collect information on the demographic status of the population, information such as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, and family structure.  From time to time additional questions are included on such important subjects as health, education, income, and previous work experience.  The statistics resulting from these questions serve to update similar information collected once every 10 years through the decennial census, and are used by Government policymakers and legislators as important indicators of our Nation's economic situation and for planning and evaluating many Government programs.   The CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of the population of the United States.  Because it is not possible to develop one or two overall figures (such as the number of unemployed) that would adequately describe the labor market, the CPS is designed to provide a large amount of detailed and supplementary data.  Such data are made available to meet a wide variety of needs on the part of users of labor market information.   Thus, the CPS is the only source of monthly estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm); nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid workers in nonfarm family enterprises; wage and salary employees; and, finally, estimates of total unemployment.   It provides the only available distribution of workers by the number of hours worked (as distinguished from aggregate or average hours for an industry), permitting separate analyses of part-time workers, workers on overtime, etc.  The survey is also the only comprehensive current source of information on the occupation of workers and the industries in which they work.  Information is available from the survey not only for persons currently in the labor force but also for those who are outside the labor force.  The characteristics of such persons -- whether married women with or without young children, disabled persons, students, older retired workers, etc., can be determined.  Information on their current desire for work, their past work experience, and their intentions for job seeking are also available.    The March CPS, also known as the Annual Demographic File, contains the basic monthly demographic and labor force data described above, plus additional data on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration.     CPS Sample    The CPS sample is based on the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States.  The sample is located in 792 sample areas comprising 2,007 counties and independent cities with coverage in every State and in the District of Columbia.   In all, some 60,000 housing units or other living quarters are assigned for interview each month; about 47,000 of them containing approximately 94,000 persons 15 years old and over are interviewed.  Also included are demographic data for approximately 28,000 children 0-14 years old and 450 Armed Forces members living with civilians either on or off base within these households.  The remainder of the assigned housing units are found to be vacant, converted to nonresidential use, contain persons with residence elsewhere, or are not interviewed because the residents are not found at home after repeated calls, are temporarily absent, or are unavailable for other reasons.  Approximately 12,000 noninterview households are present each month.  The resulting file size is approximately 136,000 records.  In March of each year supplemental data are collected for Armed Forces members residing with their families in civilian housing units or on a military base.  The Armed Forces members, however, are not asked the monthly labor force questions.  In addition, the March CPS is supplemented with a sample of Hispanic households identified the previous November.  This results in the addition of about 3,500 households (3,000 Interviewed) in the March CPS.  The inclusion of the additional sample of Hispanic households began in 1976.   A more precise explanation regarding the CPS sample design is provided in Technical Paper 40,  The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology.    For a more detailed discussion about the basic labor force data gathered on a monthly basis in the CPS survey, see the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report No. 463 and the Current Population Report P-23, No. 62, issued jointly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census in October, 1976, and entitled Concepts and Methods Used In Labor Statistics derived from the Current Population Survey.     Questionnaire    Questionnaire facsimiles of the March 1997 CPS income supplement are shown in Appendix D in this documentation.       Revisions To The March CPS Processing System    Introduction .  Between 1988 and 1989 a new computer processing system was introduced for the March Current Population Survey.  This processing system rewrite was long overdue; the system in use before this year was first introduced in March 1976 and was never fully updated to reflect the numerous questionnaire changes that had taken place since that time.  In addition, the programs used to process the CPS file were written in a computer language that is being phased out of use at the Census Bureau.  While the March 1989 file is the first to reflect this new processing system, the March 1988 file was reprocessed based on these new procedures in order to: 1) better evaluate the new processing procedures, and 2) allow year-to-year comparisons to be made between income years 1987 and 1988 using a consistent processing system.   While the following section deals mainly with modifications to the March imputation procedures and their subsequent effect on income and poverty rates, it should be pointed out that all of the processing programs were rewritten in 1989, so that not only are the files from 1989 forward based on a somewhat different imputation system, but also reflect a rewritten weighting system, data acceptance program, family relationship edits, and new procedures to match income supplement records to the monthly CPS file.  As a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether differences (especially those based on relatively small bases) are the result of imputation or other processing differences between the original and revised files.   Since the Census Bureau began imputing the missing income data on the CPS in 1962, there have been three major revisions to the processing system (in 1967, 1976, and 1988).  Through all of these revisions, the basic strategy used in make imputations has remained the same.  This approach, commonly referred to as ``hot deck'' imputation, assigns missing responses to sample persons with information from matched sample persons with similar demographic and economic information who answered these questions.   Under the new March processing system, there were three main modifications to the income imputation programs:     1. The edits and imputations were expanded to reflect the full detail of the March income questionnaire.  The original processing system was still based on a less detailed CPS income questionnaire that had not been in use since 1980.     2. Under the revised processing procedures, entire sets of March income and noncash benefits data were imputed to supplement noninterviews from the same interviewed person.  Under the original processing procedures, earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits were imputed in separate stages during the processing system.  Thus, the new processing system imputes noninterviews more efficiently and is better able to preserve the correlation between earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits.      3. Both the old and new processing systems employ what are called ''statistical matches'' to link sample cases with reported data to those requiring imputation for missing responses.  In the original processing system, under certain circumstances, reported data were removed and replaced with imputed data during the statistical matching process.  Under the new system, reported data are never removed.  This was accomplished by expanding the number of statistical matches in the income imputation system.     File Structure    There is a household record for each household or group quarters.  The  household record is followed by one of three possible structures:     A. If the household contains related persons and is not a group quarters household:     1. The family record appears next followed by person records for members of the family who are not also members of a related subfamily.  The person records would be ordered: family householder, spouse of family householder, children in the family, and other relatives of the family householder.     2. The above records may be followed by one or more related subfamily records, each related subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of that related subfamily.  The person records would be ordered:  reference person of the related subfamily, spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily reference person.     3. The above records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily records, each unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of that unrelated subfamily.  The person  records would be ordered:  unrelated subfamily reference person, spouse  of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily reference  person.     4. The above records may be followed by one or more persons living with nonrelatives family records, each to be followed by the person record  for the unrelated individual it represents.  (See Figure 1, page 2-4.)     B. If the household contains a householder with no relatives and is not a group quarters household:     1. The family record for the nonfamily householder is followed immediately  by the person record for that nonfamily householder.     2. These records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily  records, each unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by the person records for members of that unrelated subfamily.     3. These records may be followed by one or more family records for persons living with nonrelatives, each person living with nonrelatives family  record being followed immediately by the person record for that person  living with nonrelatives.  (See Figure 2, page 2-5.)     C. If the household is a group quarters, each person is defined as a person living with nonrelatives.  There will be a family record followed by a person record for each person in the group quarters.      Relationship of Current Population Survey Files to Publications    Each month, a significant amount of information about the labor force is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Employment and Earnings and  Monthly Labor Review Reports.   As mentioned previously, the CPS also serves as a vehicle for supplemental inquiries on subjects other than employment which are periodically added to the  questionnaire.  From the basic and supplemental data the Bureau of the Census issues four series of publications under the general title Current Population  Reports:     P-20  Population Characteristics  P-23  Special Studies    P-27  Farm Population    P-60  Consumer Income     Of particular interest to users of the March microdata file would be those reports based on information collected in March.

NOTE:  Each person in group quarters is by definition a person living with nonrelatives.      Geographic Limitations    One set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files should be treated with caution.  These are estimates for individual metropolitan areas.  Although estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth, should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000) should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling variability associated with these estimates.  For these areas, estimates comparing percent distributions and ratios will provide data with less sampling variability than estimates of levels will.   It should be kept in mind that the sample design and methods of weighting CPS data are geared towards producing estimates for the entire Nation.  Consequently, data for states are not as reliable as national data, and the file will lose some of its utility in certain applications.  For further discussion of such considerations, the user should consult  The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology  (Technical Paper 40, U.S. Bureau of the Census).   The nature of the work done by each individual investigator using the microdata file will determine to what extent his/her requirements for precision will allow using some of the smaller geographic areas identified on the file.     Weights    For all CPS data files a single weight is prepared and used to compute the monthly labor force status estimates.  An additional weight was prepared for the earnings universe which roughly corresponds to wage and salary workers in the two outgoing rotations.  This is explained below in the section on earnings data.  However, the difference in content of the March CPS supplement requires the presentation of additional weights:  a household weight, a family weight, and a March supplement weight.  In this section we briefly describe the construction and use of these weights.  Chapter 5 of Technical paper 40, The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology provides documentation of the weighting procedures for the CPS both with and without supplement questions.   The final weight, which is the product of several adjustments, is used to produce population estimates for the various items covered in the regular monthly CPS.  This weight is constructed from the basic weight for each person, which represents the probability of selection for the survey.  The basic weight is adjusted for special sampling situations and failure to obtain interviews from eligible households (noninterview adjustment).  A two-stage ratio estimation procedure adjusts the sample population to the known distribution of the entire population.  This two-stage ratio estimation process produces factors which are applied to the basic weight (after the special weighting and noninterview adjustments are made) and results in the final weight associated with each record.  In summary, the final weight is the product of:  (1) the basic weight, (2) adjustments for special weighting, (3) noninterview adjustment, (4) first stage ratio adjustment factor, and (5) second stage ratio adjustment factor.  This final weight should be used when producing estimates from the basic CPS data.   Differences in the questionnaire, sample and data uses for the March CPS supplement result in the need for additional adjustment procedures to produce what is called the March supplement weight.  The sample for the March CPS supplement is expanded to include male members of the Armed Forces who are living in civilian housing or with the family on a military base, as well as additional Hispanic households which are not included in the monthly labor force estimates.     The expanded sample and the need to have a husband and wife receive the same weight has resulted in a weighting system which produces the March supplement weight.  The March supplement weight should be used for producing estimates from March supplement data.   Finally, household and family weights are the weights assigned from the householder or reference person after all adjustments have been made and should be used when tabulating estimates of families-households.     Earnings Data    Beginning in 1982, usual hourly and weekly earnings data appear on the Annual Demographic File (ADF) for that portion of the population roughly corresponding to wage and salary workers (self-employed persons in incorporated businesses are excluded, although they are normally included with the wage and salary population).  These data are now collected on a monthly basis in the two outgoing rotation groups as part of the basic CPS labor force interview.   Since the intent of the regular collection of earnings data was to initiate a family earnings data series, all persons in the two outgoing rotations receive an ''earnings weight,'' even if they are not eligible for the earnings item.  The earnings weight is a simple ratio-estimation to the person's labor force status by age, race, and sex.  When tabulating estimates of earnings based on basic CPS data, use the earnings weight.   Further information on this earnings series is contained in  Technical Description of the Quarterly Data on Weekly Earnings from the Current Population Survey,  BLS Report #601, July 1980.

GX069-62-15731863	OVERVIEW     Current Population Survey        Introduction    The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of the official Government statistics on employment and unemployment.  The CPS has been conducted monthly for over 50 years.  Currently, we interview about 48,000 households monthly, scientifically selected on the basis of area of residence to represent the Nation as a whole, individual States, and other specified areas.  Each household is interviewed once a month for four consecutive months one year, and again for the corresponding time period a year later.  This technique enables us to obtain month-to-month and year-to-year comparisons at a reasonable cost while minimizing the inconvenience to any one household.   Although the main purpose of the survey is to collect information on the employment situation, a very important secondary purpose is to collect information on the demographic status of the population, information such as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, and family structure.  From time to time additional questions are included on such important subjects as health, education, income, and previous work experience.  The statistics resulting from these questions serve to update similar information collected once every 10 years through the decennial census, and are used by Government policymakers and legislators as important indicators of our Nation's economic situation and for planning and evaluating many Government programs.   The CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of the population of the United States.  Because it is not possible to develop one or two overall figures (such as the number of unemployed) that would adequately describe the labor market, the CPS is designed to provide a large amount of detailed and supplementary data.  Such data are made available to meet a wide variety of needs on the part of users of labor market information.   Thus, the CPS is the only source of monthly estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm); nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid workers in nonfarm family enterprises; wage and salary employees; and, finally, estimates of total unemployment.   It provides the only available distribution of workers by the number of hours worked (as distinguished from aggregate or average hours for an industry), permitting separate analyses of part-time workers, workers on overtime, etc.  The survey is also the only comprehensive current source of information on the occupation of workers and the industries in which they work.  Information is available from the survey not only for persons currently in the labor force but also for those who are outside the labor force.  The characteristics of such persons -- whether married women with or without young children, disabled persons, students, older retired workers, etc., can be determined.  Information on their current desire for work, their past work experience, and their intentions for job seeking are also available.    The March CPS, also known as the Annual Demographic File, contains the basic monthly demographic and labor force data described above, plus additional data on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration.     CPS Sample    The CPS sample is based on the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States.  The sample is located in 792 sample areas comprising 2,007 counties and independent cities with coverage in every State and in the District of Columbia.   In all, some 60,000 housing units or other living quarters are assigned for interview each month; about 48,000 of them containing approximately 94,000 persons 15 years old and over are interviewed.  Also included are demographic data for approximately 28,000 children 0-14 years old and 450 Armed Forces members living with civilians either on or off base within these households.  The remainder of the assigned housing units are found to be vacant, converted to nonresidential use, contain persons with residence elsewhere, or are not interviewed because the residents are not found at home after repeated calls, are temporarily absent, or are unavailable for other reasons.  Approximately 12,000 noninterview households are present each month.  The resulting file size is approximately 136,000 records.  In March of each year supplemental data are collected for Armed Forces members residing with their families in civilian housing units or on a military base.  The Armed Forces members, however, are not asked the monthly labor force questions.  In addition, the March CPS is supplemented with a sample of Hispanic households identified the previous November.  This results in the addition of about 3,000 households (2,500 Interviewed) in the March CPS.  The inclusion of the additional sample of Hispanic households began in 1976.   A more precise explanation regarding the CPS sample design is provided in Technical Paper 40,  The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology.    For a more detailed discussion about the basic labor force data gathered on a monthly basis in the CPS survey, see the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report No. 463 and the Current Population Report P-23, No. 62, issued jointly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census in October, 1976, and entitled Concepts and Methods Used In Labor Statistics derived from the Current Population Survey.     Questionnaire    Questionnaire facsimiles of the March 1997 CPS income supplement are shown in Appendix D in this documentation.       Revisions To The March CPS Processing System    Introduction .

The person  records would be ordered:  unrelated subfamily reference person, spouse  of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily reference  person.     4. The above records may be followed by one or more persons living with nonrelatives family records, each to be followed by the person record  for the unrelated individual it represents.  (See Figure 1, page 2-4.)     B. If the household contains a householder with no relatives and is not a group quarters household:     1.

NOTE:  Each person in group quarters is by definition a person living with nonrelatives.      Geographic Limitations    One set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files should be treated with caution.  These are estimates for individual metropolitan areas.  Although estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth, should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000) should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling variability associated with these estimates.  For these areas, estimates comparing percent distributions and ratios will provide data with less sampling variability than estimates of levels will.   It should be kept in mind that the sample design and methods of weighting CPS data are geared towards producing estimates for the entire Nation.  Consequently, data for states are not as reliable as national data, and the file will lose some of its utility in certain applications.  For further discussion of such considerations, the user should consult  The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology  (Technical Paper 40, U.S. Bureau of the Census).   The nature of the work done by each individual investigator using the microdata file will determine to what extent his/her requirements for precision will allow using some of the smaller geographic areas identified on the file.     Weights    For all CPS data files a single weight is prepared and used to compute the monthly labor force status estimates.  An additional weight was prepared for the earnings universe which roughly corresponds to wage and salary workers in the two outgoing rotations.  This is explained below in the section on earnings data.  However, the difference in content of the March CPS supplement requires the presentation of additional weights:  a household weight, a family weight, and a March supplement weight.  In this section we briefly describe the construction and use of these weights.  Chapter 5 of Technical paper 40, The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology provides documentation of the weighting procedures for the CPS both with and without supplement questions.   The final weight, which is the product of several adjustments, is used to produce population estimates for the various items covered in the regular monthly CPS.  This weight is constructed from the basic weight for each person, which represents the probability of selection for the survey.  The basic weight is adjusted for special sampling situations and failure to obtain interviews from eligible households (noninterview adjustment).  A two-stage ratio estimation procedure adjusts the sample population to the known distribution of the entire population.  This two-stage ratio estimation process produces factors which are applied to the basic weight (after the special weighting and noninterview adjustments are made) and results in the final weight associated with each record.  In summary, the final weight is the product of:  (1) the basic weight, (2) adjustments for special weighting, (3) noninterview adjustment, (4) first stage ratio adjustment factor, and (5) second stage ratio adjustment factor.  This final weight should be used when producing estimates from the basic CPS data.   Differences in the questionnaire, sample and data uses for the March CPS supplement result in the need for additional adjustment procedures to produce what is called the March supplement weight.  The sample for the March CPS supplement is expanded to include male members of the Armed Forces who are living in civilian housing or with the family on a military base, as well as additional Hispanic households which are not included in the monthly labor force estimates.     The expanded sample and the need to have a husband and wife receive the same weight has resulted in a weighting system which produces the March supplement weight.  The March supplement weight should be used for producing estimates from March supplement data.   Finally, household and family weights are the weights assigned from the householder or reference person after all adjustments have been made and should be used when tabulating estimates of families-households.     Earnings Data    Beginning in 1982, usual hourly and weekly earnings data appear on the Annual Demographic File (ADF) for that portion of the population roughly corresponding to wage and salary workers (self-employed persons in incorporated businesses are excluded, although they are normally included with the wage and salary population).  These data are now collected on a monthly basis in the two outgoing rotation groups as part of the basic CPS labor force interview.   Since the intent of the regular collection of earnings data was to initiate a family earnings data series, all persons in the two outgoing rotations receive an ''earnings weight,'' even if they are not eligible for the earnings item.  The earnings weight is a simple ratio-estimation to the person's labor force status by age, race, and sex.  When tabulating estimates of earnings based on basic CPS data, use the earnings weight.   Further information on this earnings series is contained in  Technical Description of the Quarterly Data on Weekly Earnings from the Current Population Survey,  BLS Report #601, July 1980.

EST Media contact:                 606-5902     Friday, January 31, 1997                              UNION MEMBERS IN 1996      Union membership as a percent of wage and salary employment continued to decline in 1996, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.  Union members accounted for 14.5 percent of wage and salary employment in 1996, down from 14.9 percent in 1995.  In 1983, the first year for which comparable data are available, union members made up 20.1 percent of wage and salary workers.     In 1996, as wage and salary employment continued to rise, the number who were members of unions totaled 16.3 million, little changed from the prior year.  Nearly three-fifths of union members (9.4 million) were in private industry, where they constituted 10.2 percent of wage and salary employment.  There were 6.9 million union members in government (federal, state, and local), where they accounted for 37.7 percent of wage and salary employment.  Membership by industry and occupation     Among private industry groups, transportation and public utilities had the highest proportion of workers who were union members (27 percent). Other major groups with membership proportions above the private industry average were construction (19 percent), manufacturing (17 percent), and mining (14 percent).  The remaining private industry groups had unionization rates ranging from 2 to 6 percent. (See table 3.)     Precision production, craft, and repair occupations (including, for example, mechanics, electricians, and other skilled trades workers) and operators, fabricators, and laborers (including machine and vehicle operators, assemblers, cleaners, and helpers) continued to have the highest proportions of union members (23 percent each).  In contrast, union membership proportions were about 1 in 10 among technical and administrative support occupations and 1 in 20 among farming, forestry, and fishing workers. (See table 3.)  Demographic characteristics of union members     Union membership was higher among men (17 percent) than women (12 percent) and higher among blacks (19 percent) than either whites (14 percent) or Hispanics (13 percent).  Within these major groups, black men                                    - 2 -  continued to have the highest union membership rate (22 percent), while white women had the lowest rate (11 percent).  Workers ages 35 to 64 had higher unionization rates than either younger or older workers.  Full-time workers were more than twice as likely as part timers to be union members. (See table 1.)  Union representation of non-members     In 1996, 1.9 million wage and salary workers were represented at their work place by a union, although they were not union members themselves.  A little more than half worked in government.  Earnings     Among full-time wage and salary workers, union members had median usual weekly earnings of $615 in 1996, compared with a median of $462 for workers not represented by unions.  (See tables 2 and 4.)  This difference reflects a variety of influences in addition to coverage by a collective bargaining agreement, including variations in the distribution of union members and nonunion employees by gender, occupation, industry, firm size, or geographic region.  (For a discussion of the problem of differentiating between the influence of unionization status and other worker characteristics on employee earnings, see Kay E. Anderson, Philip M. Doyle, and Albert E. Schwenk, ""Measuring union-nonunion earnings differences,"" Monthly Labor Review, June 1990, pp. 26-38.)  The disparities in union- nonunion earnings were greater for women than for men and for Hispanics and blacks than for whites. Technical Note      The union membership and earnings estimates presented in this release are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS).  The CPS is a monthly sample survey of about 50,000  households, conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The union membership data are gathered quarterly through a quarter sample of the CPS.  The CPS provides estimates of the number of wage and salary employees who are union members and those who are represented by a union at their work place, regardless of whether they are union members.  Union members include employees belonging to traditional labor unions or to employee associations similar to labor unions.  The membership estimates exclude workers who are self-employed, not in the labor force, or unemployed.

Definitions      The principal definitions used in this release are described briefly below.     Wage and salary employees.  Employees in both the private and public sectors who receive wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or piece rates.  Self-employed persons whose businesses are incorporated are not counted as wage and salary workers for the purposes of the union membership data.     Full-time workers.  Workers who usually work 35 hours or more per week.     Part-time workers.  Workers who usually work fewer than 35 hours per week.     Hispanic origin.  Refers to persons who are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or of other Hispanic origin or descent. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; hence, they are included in the numbers for the white and black population groups.  Reliability     Because the CPS estimates of union membership are based in part on a scientifically selected probability sample, rather than a census of the entire population, they may differ from the results obtained from a census. The sample used was one of many possible samples, each of which could have produced different estimates.  The variation in the sample estimates across all possible samples that could have been drawn is measured by the standard error which for the CPS is estimated using generalized variance function methodology.  The standard error may be used to calculate a ""confidence interval""  around a sample estimate.                                    - 2 -     The 90-percent confidence interval is the interval centered at the sample estimate that includes all values within 1.6 times the estimate's standard error.  If many different samples were selected to estimate the population value (e.g., union membership), the 90-percent confidence interval would include the true population value approximately 90 percent of the time.     For example, the estimate of 16,269,000 employed union members in 1996 has an estimated standard error of 146,645.  Hence, we are 90-percent confident that the interval between 16,034,368 and 16,503,632 (or 16,269,000 + 1.6 X 146,645) includes the true population value for union membership.     The data also are subject to nonsampling error.  For example, information on job-related characteristics of the worker, such as industry, occupation, union membership, and earnings, are sometimes reported by a household member other than the worker.  Consequently, such data may reflect reporting error by the respondent.  Moreover, in some cases, respondents might erroneously report ""take home"" pay rather than gross earnings, or may round up or down from actual earnings.     For a general discussion of the quality of employment data from the CPS, see the Explanatory Notes and Estimates of Error section of any issue of Employment and Earnings, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

GX157-26-8089253	"OVERVIEW     Current Population Survey     Introduction      The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of the official Government statistics on employment and unemployment. The CPS has been conducted monthly for over 50 years. Currently, we interview about 48,000 households monthly, scientifically selected on the basis of area of residence to represent the Nation as a whole, individual States, and other specified areas. Each household is interviewed once a month for four consecutive months one year, and again for the corresponding time period a year later. This technique enables us to obtain month-to-month and year-to-year comparisons at a reasonable cost while minimizing the inconvenience to any one household.     Although the main purpose of the survey is to collect information on the employment situation, a very important secondary purpose is to collect information on the demographic status of the population, information such as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, and family structure. From time to time additional questions are included on such important subjects as health, education, income, and previous work experience. The statistics resulting from these questions serve to update similar information collected once every 10 years through the decennial census, and are used by Government policymakers and legislators as important indicators of our Nation's economic situation and for planning and evaluating many Government programs.     The CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of the population of the United States. Because it is not possible to develop one or two overall figures (such as the number of unemployed) that would adequately describe the labor market, the CPS is designed to provide a large amount of detailed and supplementary data. Such data are made available to meet a wide variety of needs on the part of users of labor market information.     Thus, the CPS is the only source of monthly estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm); nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid workers in nonfarm family enterprises; wage and salary employees; and, finally, estimates of total unemployment.     It provides the only available distribution of workers by the number of hours worked (as distinguished from aggregate or average hours for an industry), permitting separate analyses of part-time workers, workers on overtime, etc. The survey is also the only comprehensive current source of information on the occupation of workers and the industries in which they work. Information is available from the survey not only for persons currently in the labor force but also for those who are outside the labor force. The characteristics of such persons -- whether married women with or without young children, disabled persons, students, older retired workers, etc., can be determined. Information on their current desire for work, their past work experience, and their intentions for job seeking are also available.     The March CPS, also known as the Annual Demographic File, contains the basic monthly demographic and labor force data described above, plus additional data on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration.     CPS Sample      The CPS sample is based on the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. The sample is located in 792 sample areas comprising 2,007 counties and independent cities with coverage in every State and in the District of Columbia.     In all, some 60,000 housing units or other living quarters are assigned for interview each month; about 48,000 of them containing approximately 94,000 persons 15 years old and over are interviewed. Also included are demographic data for approximately 28,000 children 0-14 years old and 450 Armed Forces members living with civilians either on or off base within these households. The remainder of the assigned housing units are found to be vacant, converted to nonresidential use, contain persons with residence elsewhere, or are not interviewed because the residents are not found at home after repeated calls, are temporarily absent, or are unavailable for other reasons. Approximately 12,000 noninterview households are present each month. The resulting file size is approximately 136,000 records. In March of each year supplemental data are collected for Armed Forces members residing with their families in civilian housing units or on a military base. The Armed Forces members, however, are not asked the monthly labor force questions. In addition, the March CPS is supplemented with a sample of Hispanic households identified the previous November. This results in the addition of about 3,000 households (2,500 Interviewed) in the March CPS. The inclusion of the additional sample of Hispanic households began in 1976.     A more precise explanation regarding the CPS sample design is provided in Technical Paper 40,  The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology.      For a more detailed discussion about the basic labor force data gathered on a monthly basis in the CPS survey, see the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report No. 463 and the Current Population Report P-23, No. 62, issued jointly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census in October, 1976, and entitled Concepts and Methods Used In Labor Statistics derived from the Current Population Survey.     Questionnaire      Questionnaire facsimiles of the March 1996 CPS income supplement are shown in Appendix D in this documentation.     Revisions To The March CPS Processing System      Introduction . Between 1988 and 1989 a new computer processing system was introduced for the March Current Population Survey. This processing system rewrite was long overdue; the system in use before this year was first introduced in March 1976 and was never fully updated to reflect the numerous questionnaire changes that had taken place since that time. In addition, the programs used to process the CPS file were written in a computer language that is being phased out of use at the Census Bureau. While the March 1989 file is the first to reflect this new processing system, the March 1988 file was reprocessed based on these new procedures in order to: 1) better evaluate the new processing procedures, and 2) allow year-to-year comparisons to be made between income years 1987 and 1988 using a consistent processing system.     While the following section deals mainly with modifications to the March imputation procedures and their subsequent effect on income and poverty rates, it should be pointed out that all of the processing programs were rewritten in 1989, so that not only are the files from 1989 forward based on a somewhat different imputation system, but also reflect a rewritten weighting system, data acceptance program, family relationship edits, and new procedures to match income supplement records to the monthly CPS file. As a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether differences (especially those based on relatively small bases) are the result of imputation or other processing differences between the original and revised files.     Since the Census Bureau began imputing the missing income data on the CPS in 1962, there have been three major revisions to the processing system (in 1967, 1976, and 1989). Through all of these revisions, the basic strategy used in make imputations has remained the same. This approach, commonly referred to as ""hot deck"" imputation, assigns missing responses to sample persons with information from matched sample persons with similar demographic and economic information who answered these questions.     Under the new March processing system, there were three main modifications to the income imputation programs:        1. The edits and imputations were expanded to reflect the full detail of the March   income questionnaire. The original processing system was still based on a less detailed   CPS income questionnaire that had not been in use since 1980.      2. Under the revised processing procedures, entire sets of March income and noncash   benefits data were imputed to supplement noninterviews from the same interviewed person.   Under the original processing procedures, earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits   were imputed in separate stages during the processing system. Thus, the new processing   system imputes noninterviews more efficiently and is better able to preserve the   correlation between earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits.      3. Both the old and new processing systems employ what are called ""statistical   matches"" to link sample cases with reported data to those requiring imputation for   missing responses. In the original processing system, under certain circumstances,   reported data were removed and replaced with imputed data during the statistical matching   process. Under the new system, reported data are never removed. This was accomplished by   expanding the number of statistical matches in the income imputation system.       File Structure      There is a household record for each household or group quarters. The household record is followed by one of three possible structures:        A. If the household contains related persons and is not a group quarters household:        1. The family record appears next followed by person records for members of the family     who are not also members of a related subfamily. The person records would be ordered:     family householder, spouse of family householder, children in the family, and other     relatives of the family householder.        2. The above records may be followed by one or more related subfamily records, each     related subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of that     related subfamily. The person records would be ordered: reference person of the related     subfamily, spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily reference     person.        3. The above records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily records, each     unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of     that unrelated subfamily. The person records would be ordered: unrelated subfamily     reference person, spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily     reference person.        4. The above records may be followed by one or more persons living with nonrelatives     family records, each to be followed by the person record for the unrelated individual it     represents. (See Figure 1, page 2-4.)          B. If the household contains a householder with no relatives and is not a group   quarters household:        1. The family record for the nonfamily householder is followed immediately by the     person record for that nonfamily householder.        2. These records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily records, each     unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by the person records for members of     that unrelated subfamily.        3. These records may be followed by one or more family records for persons living with     nonrelatives, each person living with nonrelatives family record being followed     immediately by the person record for that person living with nonrelatives. (See Figure 2,     page 2-5.)          C. If the household is a group quarters, each person is defined as a person living with   nonrelatives. There will be a family record followed by a person record for each person in   the group quarters.       Relationship of Current Population Survey Files to Publications      Each month, a significant amount of information about the labor force is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Employment and Earnings and Monthly Labor Review Reports.     As mentioned previously, the CPS also serves as a vehicle for supplemental inquiries on subjects other than employment which are periodically added to the questionnaire. From the basic and supplemental data the Bureau of the Census issues four series of publications under the general title Current Population Reports:     P-20 Population Characteristics  P-23 Special Studies   P-27 Farm Population   P-60 Consumer Income       Of particular interest to users of the March microdata file would be those reports based on information collected in March. These reports include the following titles:     P-20 Population Profile of the United States: (Year)   P-20 Household and Family Characteristics: March (Year)   P-20 Households, Families, Marital Status, and Living Arrangements: March (Year)   P-20 Geographical Mobility (Years)   P-20 Educational Attainment in the United States (Years)  P-20 Persons of Hispanic Origin in the United States (Year)       P-60 Money Income and Poverty Status of Families and Persons in the United States: (Year)  P-60 Characteristics of the Population Below the Poverty Level: (Year)   P-60 Characteristics of Households Receiving Selected Noncash Benefits: (Year)       All Current Population Reports may be obtained by subscription from the U.S. Government Printing Office. Subscriptions are available as follows: Population Characteristics, Special Studies, Farm Population, and Consumer Income series (P-20,  P-23, P-27, P-60) combined, $71 per year (sold as a package only); Population Estimates and Projections (P-25), $25 per year. Single issues may be ordered separately; ordering information and prices are in the  Bureau of the Census Catalog  and  Guide , in  Census   and   You , and the  Monthly Product Announcement  (MPA).

NOTE:  Each person in group quarters is by definition a person living with nonrelatives.      Geographic Limitations      One set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files should be treated with caution. These are estimates for individual metropolitan areas. Although estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth, should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000) should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling variability associated with these estimates. For these areas, estimates comparing percent distributions and ratios will provide data with less sampling variability than estimates of levels will.     It should be kept in mind that the sample design and methods of weighting CPS data are geared towards producing estimates for the entire Nation. Consequently, data for states are not as reliable as national data, and the file will lose some of its utility in certain applications. For further discussion of such considerations, the user should consult  The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology  (Technical Paper 40, U.S. Bureau of the Census).     The nature of the work done by each individual investigator using the microdata file will determine to what extent his/her requirements for precision will allow using some of the smaller geographic areas identified on the file.     Weights      For all CPS data files a single weight is prepared and used to compute the monthly labor force status estimates. An additional weight was prepared for the earnings universe which roughly corresponds to wage and salary workers in the two outgoing rotations. This is explained below in the section on earnings data. However, the difference in content of the March CPS supplement requires the presentation of additional weights: a household weight, a family weight, and a March supplement weight. In this section we briefly describe the construction and use of these weights. Chapter 5 of Technical paper 40, The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology provides documentation of the weighting procedures for the CPS both with and without supplement questions.     The final weight, which is the product of several adjustments, is used to produce population estimates for the various items covered in the regular monthly CPS. This weight is constructed from the basic weight for each person, which represents the probability of selection for the survey. The basic weight is adjusted for special sampling situations and failure to obtain interviews from eligible households (noninterview adjustment). A two-stage ratio estimation procedure adjusts the sample population to the known distribution of the entire population. This two-stage ratio estimation process produces factors which are applied to the basic weight (after the special weighting and noninterview adjustments are made) and results in the final weight associated with each record. In summary, the final weight is the product of: (1) the basic weight, (2) adjustments for special weighting, (3) noninterview adjustment, (4) first stage ratio adjustment factor, and (5) second stage ratio adjustment factor. This final weight should be used when producing estimates from the basic CPS data.     Differences in the questionnaire, sample and data uses for the March CPS supplement result in the need for additional adjustment procedures to produce what is called the March supplement weight. The sample for the March CPS supplement is expanded to include male members of the Armed Forces who are living in civilian housing or with the family on a military base, as well as additional Hispanic households which are not included in the monthly labor force estimates.     The expanded sample and the need to have a husband and wife receive the same weight has resulted in a weighting system which produces the March supplement weight. The March supplement weight should be used for producing estimates from March supplement data.     Finally, household and family weights are the weights assigned from the householder or reference person after all adjustments have been made and should be used when tabulating estimates of families-households.     Earnings Data      Beginning in 1982, usual hourly and weekly earnings data appear on the Annual Demographic File (ADF) for that portion of the population roughly corresponding to wage and salary workers (self-employed persons in incorporated businesses are excluded, although they are normally included with the wage and salary population). These data are now collected on a monthly basis in the two outgoing rotation groups as part of the basic CPS labor force interview.     Since the intent of the regular collection of earnings data was to initiate a family earnings data series, all persons in the two outgoing rotations receive an ``earnings weight,'' even if they are not eligible for the earnings item. The earnings weight is a simple ratio-estimation to the person's labor force status by age, race, and sex. When tabulating estimates of earnings based on basic CPS data, use the earnings weight.     Further information on this earnings series is contained in  Technical Description of the Quarterly Data on Weekly Earnings from the Current Population Survey,  BLS Report #601, July 1980. This report is available on request from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, D.C. 20212. Attn: Office of Inquiries and Correspondence.     NOTE: For 1982 and 1983, usual weekly earnings are not present for individuals who were not paid on an hourly basis.

EST Media contact:                606-5902  Friday, January 30, 1998                              Union Members in 1997        The share of workers who were union members continued to decline in 1997, the U.S. Department of Labors Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.  Union members accounted for 14.1 percent of wage and salary employment in 1997, down from 14.5 percent in 1996.  The union membership rate has fallen steadily from 20.1 percent in 1983, the first year for which comparable data are available.       About three-fifths of the 16.1 million union members in 1997 were in private nonagricultural industries, where they constituted 9.8 percent of wage and salary employment.  About 6.7 million union members worked in government (federal, state, and local), accounting for 37.2 percent of government employment.  Membership by industry and occupation       Among the private nonagricultural industries, transportation and public utilities had the highest unionization rate (26.0 percent), followed by construction (18.6 percent).  Manufacturing and mining also had above- average unionization rates, at 16.3 and 13.9 percent, respectively.  In the other industry groups, the proportion of workers who were members of unions ranged from about 2.1 to 5.8 percent. (See table 3.)       Among the occupational groups, the unionization rate was highest among those working in protective service jobs (39.9 percent).  This group includes many government workers such as police officers and firefighters. Union membership rates also were high in professional specialty; precision production, craft, and repair; and operator, fabricator, and laborer occupations.  Rates were lowest in sales and in farming, forestry, and fishing occupations, at 4.3 and 4.6 percent, respectively.  (See table 3.)  Demographic characteristics of union members       Union membership was higher among men (16.3 percent) than women (11.6 percent) and higher among blacks (17.9 percent) than either whites (13.6 percent) or Hispanics (11.8 percent).  Within these groups, black men continued to have the highest union membership rate (20.2 percent), while white and Hispanic women had the lowest rates (both about 11 percent). Workers ages 35 to 64 were more likely to be members of unions than either their younger or older counterparts.  Full-time workers were more than twice as likely as part timers to be union members.  (See table 1.)  Union representation of nonmembers       About 1.8 million wage and salary workers were represented at their work place by a union in 1997, while not being union members themselves. About half of these workers were employed in government.                                    - 2 -  Earnings       In 1997, union members had median usual weekly earnings of $640 compared with a median of $478 for wage and salary employees not represented by unions.  (See table 2.)  This difference reflects a variety of influences in addition to coverage by a collective bargaining agreement, including variations in the distributions of union members and nonunion employees by occupation, industry, firm size, or geographic region.  (For a discussion of the problem of differentiating between the influence of unionization status and the influence of other worker characteristics on employee earnings, see Kay E. Anderson, Philip M. Doyle, and Albert E. Schwenk, ""Measuring union-nonunion earnings differences,"" Monthly Labor Review, June 1990, pp. 26-38.)  The union-nonunion earnings ratio was greater for women than for men and for blacks and Hispanics than for whites. Technical Note        The estimates in this release are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provides the basic information on the labor force, employment, and unemployment.  The survey is conducted monthly for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the Bureau of the Census from a scientifically selected national sample of about 50,000 households.  The union membership and earnings data are tabulated from one-quarter of the CPS monthly sample and are limited to wage and salary workers.  Excluded are all self-employed workers.       Information in this release will be made available to sensory impaired individuals upon request.

Reliability       In any sample survey, variations in the data can occur by chance because a sample, rather than the whole population, is surveyed.  The standard error is a measure of such  potential variation.  The chances are about 68 out of 100 that an estimate from the survey differs from a figure that would be obtained from a complete census by less than one standard error.  The chances are about 90 out of 100 that such a difference would be less than 1.6 standard errors.       For a full discussion of the reliability of data from the CPS and information on estimating standard errors, see the ""Explanatory Notes and Estimates of Error"" section of the February 1994 and subsequent issues of Employment and Earnings.  Definitions       The principal definitions used in this release are described briefly below.       Union members.  Data refer to members of a labor union or an employee association similar to a union.       Represented by unions.  Data refer to union members, as well as workers who have no union affiliation but whose jobs are covered by a union or an employee association contract.       Usual weekly earnings. Data represent earnings before taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders).  Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week.  Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period.  Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent.  The term ""usual"" is as perceived by the respondent.  If the respondent asks for a definition of usual, interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.       Median earnings. The median is the amount which divides a given earnings distribution into two equal groups, one having earnings above the median and the other having earnings below the median.       The estimating procedure places each reported or calculated weekly earnings value into $50-wide intervals which are centered around multiples of $50.  The actual value is estimated through the linear interpolation of the interval in which the median lies.       Wage and salary workers. Workers who receive wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or piece rates.  The group includes employees in both the private and public sectors but, for the purposes of the union membership and earnings series, excludes all self-employed persons, regardless of whether or not their businesses are incorporated.       Full-time workers.  Workers who usually work 35 hours or more per week at their sole or principal job.       Part-time workers.  Workers who usually work fewer than 35 hours per week at their sole or principal job.       Hispanic origin.  Refers to persons who are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Hispanic origin or descent. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; hence, they are included in the numbers for the white and black populations.      Table 1.

whose jobs are covered by a union or an employee association contract.        3 The distinction between full- and part-time workers is based on hours usually worked. Beginning in 1994, these data will      not sum to totals because full- or part-time status on the principal job is not identifiable for a small number of multiple      jobholders.           NOTE:    Data refer to the sole or principal job of full- and part-time workers.  Excluded are self-employed workers      whose businesses are incorporated although they technically qualify as wage and salary workers.

Uses   Data on race are used in public health surveillance and in epidemiologic, clinical, and health services research.   Discussion   For more than 20 years, the Federal government has promoted the use of a common language to promote uniformity and comparability of data on race and ethnicity for population groups. Development of the data standards stemmed in large measure from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights laws. Data were needed to monitor equal access in housing, education, employment, and other areas for populations that historically had experienced discrimination and differential treatment because of their race or ethnicity. The standards are used not only in the decennial census (which provides the data for the ""denominator"" for many measures), but also in household surveys, on administrative forms (e.g., school registration and mortgage-lending applications), and in medical and other research. The categories represent a social-political construct designed for collecting data on the race and ethnicity of broad population groups in the United States.   Race is a concept used to differentiate population groups largely on the basis of physical characteristics transmitted by descent. Racial categories are neither precise nor mutually exclusive, and the concept of race lacks clear scientific definition. The common use of race in the United States draws upon differences not only in physical attributes, but also in ancestry and geographic origins. Since 1977, the Federal government has sought to standardize data on race and ethnicity among its agencies. The Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB)  Statistical Policy       Directive Number 15: Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting   (OMB, 1997) was developed to meet Federal legislative and program requirements, and these standards are used widely in the public and private sectors. The directive provides five basic racial categories but states that the collection of race data need not be limited to these categories. However, any additional reporting that uses more detail must be organized in such a way that the additional categories can be aggregated into the five basic groups. Although the directive does not specify a method of determining an individual’s race, OMB prefers self-identification to identification by an observer whenever possible. The directive states that persons of mixed racial origins should be coded using multiple categories, and not a multiracial category.   Data Type (and Field Length)   CE — coded element (60).   Repetition   Yes; if the agency providing the data to the IPV surveillance system uses multiple racial categories, the IPV surveillance system also allows for multiple racial categories to be coded.                     Field Values/Coding Instructions   Code Description   1  American Indian/Alaskan Native .

A person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term ""Spanish origin"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic or Latino.""   Uses   Data on ethnicity are used in public health surveillance and in epidemiologic, clinical, and health services research.   Discussion   Ethnicity is a concept used to differentiate population groups on the basis of shared cultural characteristics or geographic origins. A variety of cultural attributes contribute to ethnic differentiation, including language, patterns of social interaction, religion, and styles of dress. However, ethnic differentiation is imprecise and fluid. It is contingent on a sense of group identity that can change over time and that involves subjective and attitudinal influences. Since 1977, the Federal government has sought to standardize data on race and ethnicity among its agencies. The Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB)  Statistical Policy Directive       Number 15: Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative       Reporting  (OMB, 1997) was developed to meet Federal legislative and program requirements, and these standards are used widely in the public and private sectors. The directive provides two basic ethnic categories —  Hispanic or Latino  and  Not of       Hispanic or Latino Origin   — but states that collection of ethnicity data need not be limited to these categories. However, any additional reporting that uses more detail must be organized in such a way that the additional categories can be aggregated into the two basic groups. OMB prefers that data on race and ethnicity be collected separately. The use of the Hispanic category in a combined race/ethnicity data element makes it impossible to distribute persons of Hispanic ethnicity by race and, therefore, reduces the utility of the five basic racial categories by excluding from them persons who would otherwise be included.

Uses   Allows examination of the correspondence between the location of the victim’s residence, the perpetrator’s residence, and the location of the most recent violent episode perpetrated by any intimate partner, and may have implications for intervention strategies.   Discussion   Additional information (e.g., street address, zip code) can easily be added as components of this element if data linkage across data sources is desired. However, to protect privacy and confidentiality, access to this level of detail must be limited to authorized personnel. The need for victim safety and confidentiality must be taken into account if the full extended version of this data element is used.   In conjunction with data elements  4.104 City, state, and county of occurrence  and  4.305 City, state, and county of residence of perpetrator of most recent violent episode , this data element allows examination of the correspondence between the victim’s residence, the perpetrator’s residence, and the location of the most recent violent episode.   Data Type (and Field Length)   XAD — extended address (106).   Repetition   No.   Field Values   Component 3 is the city. Component 4 is the state or province. Component 9 is the county/parish code. Example: Component 3 = Lima Component 4 = OH Component 9 = 019   The state or province code entered in Component 4 should be entered as a two-letter postal abbreviation. The county/parish code should be entered in Component 9 as the 3-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code. See XAD — extended address in the Technical Notes at the end of this document for additional information on other possible components of this data element. The numbering of these components (3, 4, and 9) is consistent with the numbering of components used elsewhere for full XAD coding.

Uses   Risk of victimization may vary by legal marital status. Marital status may change over the course of a relationship, particularly a violent relationship. For consistency, we recommend recording the victim’s marital status at the time the agency providing data to the IPV surveillance system first documented IPV victimization for this person.

VICTIM’S EXPERIENCE OF IPV There is variability in how intimate partner violence has been conceptualized, with some researchers combining physical violence, sexual violence, threat of physical or sexual violence, and psychological/emotional abuse, while others treat these as discrete categories. Because prevention strategies for different types of violence may differ, we suggest separating these categories for surveillance purposes.   We recognize, however, that multiple types of violence may occur in a single episode. The IPV surveillance system is designed to record each type of violence that occurs to a given victim, even if multiple types occur within a single episode. Thus, these data elements can provide a count of episodes involving several types of violence, but cannot provide a count of the total number of discrete violent episodes, nor can they provide information about the co­occurrence of different types of violence within each episode. However, data element  4.101 Type(s) of violence in most recent episode  does allow collection of such information for the most recent violent episode perpetrated by any intimate partner.

One-third of the foreign-born population is from Mexico or Central        America, according to the report entitled, ""The Foreign-Born Population in        the United States: March 2000."" Another fourth of these residents is from        Asia. More than 60 percent of this population is concentrated in two U.S.        regions --- the West and the Northeast.         The Commerce Department's Census Bureau reported December 28 that the        national headcount conducted in 2000 revealed a U.S. population of        281,421,906, an increase of 13.2 percent over the 248,709,873 persons        counted during the 1990 census.         Following is the text of the Census Bureau press release:            Foreign-Born Population Nears 30 Million, Census Bureau Estimates                 A new report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau today        estimates that the nation's foreign-born population in 2000 was 28.4        million about 1 in 10 U.S. residents.         The estimates contained in the report, The Foreign-Born Population in        the United States: March 2000, should not be confused with Census 2000        results, which are scheduled for release over the next three years.         ""About 10 percent of the nation's population was foreign-born in 2000,""        said Lisa Lollock, the report author. ""This proportion is between the high        figure of 15 percent reached during a period of heavy immigration from        Europe in 1890 and the low of 5 percent in 1970.""         The report said one-third of the foreign-born population was from        Mexico or another Central American country and about one-fourth, from        Asia.         Other highlights from the report:                                   The foreign-born population are more likely than natives to live in          the West and the Northeast. More than 6 in 10 of the foreign-born          population reside in one of these two regions, compared with less than 4          in 10 natives.                     Almost half of the foreign-born population lived in the central city          of a metropolitan area (45 percent) compared with slightly more than          one-quarter of the native population (28 percent). Only 5 percent of the          foreign-born population lived outside metro areas, compared with 21          percent of natives.                     While foreign-born residents age 25 and over were as likely as          natives to be college graduates (26 percent each), they lagged at lower          educational levels, as 67 percent of the foreign-born population and 87          percent of natives were high school graduates. Thirty-six percent of          full-time, year-round workers born outside the United States earned less          than $20,000 in 1999; this compares with 21 percent of their native          counterparts who were at that level.                     Foreign-born people were more likely than natives to be 18 to 64          years of age (8 in 10 compared with 6 in 10).                     Thirty-seven percent of the nation's foreign-born residents were          naturalized citizens. Less than 1 in 10 of the foreign-born people who          entered the United States in the 1990s had become citizens, compared          with 8 in 10 who arrived before 1970.           The report, a slide presentation, an interactive quiz and        60 statistical tables update the 1999 report on the foreign-born        population issued last September. The statistics were collected in the        March 2000 Current Population Survey, which uses the 1990 census as a base        for its sample.         The report contains data on characteristics of the foreign-born        population such as region of birth, geographic distribution in the United        States, age, citizenship, household size, marital status, educational        level, employment status, occupation, earnings and poverty status.        Comparisons are made between the foreign-born and the native populations,        as well as among the foreign-born population by region of birth,        citizenship and year of entry.

GX013-86-6493615	"Evaluating Components of International Migration:  The Residual Foreign Born    Joe Costanzo  Cynthia Davis  Caribert Irazi  Daniel Goodkind  Roberto Ramirez    DAPE Task Team #5 - Unauthorized Migration Evaluation Team (UMET)   Population Division  U. S. Bureau of the Census  Washington, D.C. 20233   December 2001   Working Paper Series No. 61    DISCLAIMER:    This paper reflects the results of research undertaken by the authors. It    has undergone a more limited review than official Census Bureau publications.    This paper is not meant to represent the official view of the U.S. Census Bureau.    This paper has been prepared to inform interested parties of on-going research    and to encourage discussion.          Synopsis    On March 1, 2001, the U.S. Census Bureau issued the recommendation of  the Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) that the  Census 2000 Redistricting Data not be adjusted based on the Accuracy  and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.).  By mid-October 2001, the Census  Bureau had to recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for  future uses, such as the census long form data products, post-censal  population estimates, and demographic survey controls.  In order to  inform that decision, the ESCAP requested that further research be  conducted.   Between March and September 2001, the Demographic Analysis-Population  Estimates (DAPE) research project addressed the discrepancy between the  demographic analysis data and the A.C.E. adjusted estimates of the  population.  Specifically, the research examined the historical levels  of the components of population change to address the possibility that  the 1990 Demographic Analysis understated the national population and  assessed whether demographic analysis had not captured the full  population growth between 1990 and 2000.  Assumptions regarding the  components of international migration (specifically, emigration,  temporary migration, legal migration, and unauthorized migration)  contain the largest uncertainty in the demographic analysis estimates.   Therefore, evaluating the components of international migration was a  critical activity in the DAPE project.    This report focuses on the evaluation of the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated    residual foreign-born population (including both unauthorized and  quasi-legal     migrants) in 1990 and 2000.  The estimates shown here were calculated in    conjunction with estimates of other components of international migration: legal    permanent migration and legal temporary migration. These components of international    migration, along with assumed deaths and emigrants, are subtracted from a total    foreign-born population yielding a residual count.  This residual foreign-born population is not an estimate of the number of    unauthorized migrants. This estimate also includes people who are here legally    but are not yet included in the official estimates of legal migrants and refugees.    It also includes people in ""quasi-legal"" status who are awaiting action    on their legal migration requests. Because the estimate was derived from a residual    methodology, any limitations in the methods or in the measurement of other migration    components are reflected in the residual number. In addition, our assumptions    include a great deal of uncertainty, especially for small migration components.    Therefore, the residual may be quite different from the actual number of unauthorized    migrants.    According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born population    was 3,765,906 in 1990 and 8,705,419 in 2000. The residual foreign born    were less likely to be male (48.4 percent) in 1990 than in 2000 (54.2 percent).    Of the residual foreign born, 26.8 percent were from Mexico in 1990 and 44.5    percent were from Mexico in 2000.           Outline       Summary        Background     Methods           Method 1 : Woodrow's 1990 DA Estimates of the Residual        Foreign-Born Population, 1990       Method 2 : Ahmed's Preliminary Estimates of the Residual        Foreign-Born Counted in the 1990 Census       Method 3 (1990) : DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born        Population, 1990       Method 3 (2000) : DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born        Population, 2000           Limitations     Results     Next Steps        Appendix A.

These ""known""    components of international migration, along with assumed deaths and emigrants,    are subtracted from a total foreign-born population yielding a residual count.       This residual foreign-born population is not an estimate of the number    of unauthorized migrants.

In addition, our assumptions    include a great deal of uncertainty, especially for small migration components.    Therefore, the residual may be quite different from the actual number of unauthorized    migrants.    According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born  population counted in the 1990 census was  3,765,906 .   Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate (discussed later in this report)  yields a population of 4,430,478 in 1990.   Selected characteristics of the residual foreign-born population  counted in Census 1990 include:      1.8 million (48.4 percent) were male     1.2 million (32.8 percent) were ages 18 to 29     1.9 million (50.7 percent) were Hispanic     1.0 million (26.8 percent) were from Mexico      According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born  population counted in the 2000 census was  8,705,419 .   Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate yields a population of 10,241,669  in 2000.   Selected characteristics of the residual foreign-born population counted  in Census 2000 include:      4.7 million (54.2 percent) were male     3.5 million (40.0 percent) were ages 18 to 29     5.4 million (61.5 percent) were Hispanic     3.9 million (44.5 percent) were from Mexico      (See Tables in  Appendix A  for more details by age, sex,    race, Hispanic origin, and place (country) of birth for both 1990 and 2000 estimates,    but recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)    The basic methodological approach for both 1990 and 2000 was the residual    method. A decennial census sample file was used for the foreign-born population    base as of April 1 st . Estimates of legal permanent residents (LPRs),    temporary migrants, and Special Agricultural Workers (SAWs) and Pre-1982 entrants    into the U.S. (LAWs) were subtracted from the foreign-born population base. 1     Assumptions were made about emigration and mortality of the legal and IRCA-legalized    populations. Race and Hispanic origin distributions were assigned by age, sex,    and place (country) of birth. 2  Population undercount    assumptions were not included in this methodology. However, estimates of the    total residual foreign-born population are shown here at different assumed levels    of undercoverage.         Background    Since the 1980s, empirically-based estimates have been developed to  measure the population of persons illegally present in the United  States.  Prior to these studies, estimates of the unauthorized population  ranged from one to twelve million. 3    The most straightforward and simplest measure of the unauthorized  population has been the residual method. This method essentially removes  the legal component of the census or survey-based foreign-born population,  leaving behind the unauthorized component as a residual.  Estimates  obtained using residual methods most often are derived from federal  data providers: the U.S. Census Bureau and the Immigration and  Naturalization Service (INS).  Using more than one data source is  required given that no one source of data includes all the necessary  components for directly estimating the unauthorized population.   Adjustments to these estimates have been made since the early 1980s.   Researchers have incorporated new components into their estimates of  unauthorized migration. (Woodrow-Lafield, 1991; Ahmed, 1995; Passel &  Clark, 1998; Bean et al., 2001)  In an effort to improve the validity  of the measures, we have adjusted characteristics of immigrants entering  under the Special Agriculture Workers (SAWs) program,  emigrants leaving  the United States, and nonimmigrants (temporary admissions not for  permanent residence).   Although the INS is the U.S. federal agency responsible for providing the    official estimates of the unauthorized population, the U.S. Census Bureau must    include assumptions about any migrants not counted in the official legal immigration    data.   As part of the Bureau's evaluation of Census 2000 results and the  determination as to whether the Census 2000 counts should be adjusted  for purposes other than reapportionment and redistricting, the Population  Division at the Census Bureau has reviewed the reliability of its  demographic analysis and population estimates methodology, and the  underlying components of population change, including components of  international migration.   This report provides an evaluation of the residual foreign-born component    of international migration as it relates to the U.S. resident population on    April 1, 1990 and April 1, 2000.     This residual foreign-born population    is not an estimate of the number of unauthorized migrants. This estimate also    includes people who are here legally but are not yet included in the official    estimates of legal migrants and refugees. It also includes people in ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Because the    estimate was derived from a residual methodology, any limitations in the methods    or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected in the residual    number. In addition, our assumptions include a great deal of uncertainty, especially    for small migration components. Therefore, the residual may be quite different    from the actual number of unauthorized migrants.             Methods    In addition to detailing our own approach to estimating the residual foreign-born    population (of which the unauthorized population is a part), this report highlights    two other methods used at the Census Bureau during the 1990s to estimate the    residual foreign-born population as of 1990. 4    In order to answer the question placed before us, ""Is the assumed flow of    unauthorized migration realistic?"", the Demographic Analysis-Population Estimates    (DAPE) team reviewed the related research conducted in the late 1980s and in    the 1990s at the Census Bureau as well as other studies addressing this issue.    (See  Appendix B  for details.)    We identified two methods as having been used in the Bureau's estimation of    the residual foreign-born population as of 1990. These methods will be referred    to as: 1) Woodrow's 1990 DA estimates (1991); and 2) Ahmed's 1990 preliminary    census estimates (1995).    Each of the methods relies on residual techniques common to the  estimation of hard-to-count populations such as the unauthorized  population.  For a residual technique, one or more identifiable  components are subtracted from a comprehensive universe (such as the  decennial census' total foreign-born population) yielding a residual  estimate of a population for which no direct measure exists.          Method 1: Woodrow's 1990 DA Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born    Population, 1990 5     Woodrow (1991) developed preliminary estimates of the 1990 residual foreign-born    population as part of the 1990 Demographic Analysis Evaluation Project. 6     This project was undertaken and completed prior to the internal release of 1990    census sample data, therefore, 1990 census data were not used in these calculations.    Woodrow estimates the residual foreign-born population residing in the United    States on April 1, 1990 using two approaches yielding ""direct"" and ""implicit""    estimates, as termed by Woodrow. For the first approach, a residual method was    applied to the 1989 Current Population Survey (CPS) to derive the size of the    residual foreign-born population. This CPS-based estimate was then extended    to reflect the size of the residual foreign-born population on April 1, 1990    by assuming a linear population growth rate. Because of the uncertainties associated    with the sampling and non-sampling errors as well as census under-coverage,    a range of possible estimates was derived. Finally, from the range of possible    values, a (mid)point estimate was determined for six separate census undercount    scenarios. The preferred undercount scenario of 25 percent yielded a midpoint    estimate of 3.3 million unauthorized persons. 7     For her second approach (yielding an ""implicit"" estimate) Woodrow carried    forward the 1980 estimate of the residual foreign-born population and estimated    change in the unauthorized and IRCA-legalized populations between 1980 and 1990    based on alternative post-1980 demographic assumptions from previous CPS-based    estimates. This approach requires estimates of: 1) 1980 residual foreign-born    population estimate; 2) the number of IRCA legalizations (LAWs and SAWs); and    3) the net change during the period.    Based on her analysis Woodrow determined likely ranges under each method,    with a 1990 estimate of 3.3 million (total residual foreign-born population    in the United States) falling in the middle of each range. When considering    census undercoverage (20 to 30 percent, as estimated by Woodrow) and the effect    of CPS sampling and estimation errors, the estimates range from a low of 1.9    million to a high of 4.5 million.    From her 1989 November CPS data carried forward to April 1, 1990, Woodrow    estimated a residual foreign-born population of 2.1 million was counted in the    1990 census (with a range of 1.6 million to 2.7 million).    Some assumptions may widen the lower end of the ranges even further.   For example, the residual method based on the 1989 CPS assumed that no  SAWs were counted among the foreign born because the number of SAWs  then known to be living in the U.S. could not be confirmed (1991, p.  16; p. 29).  Yet, Woodrow cited 1.3 million SAW applications from  June 1, 1987 to November 30, 1988.  The inclusion of a portion of these  SAWs would reduce the level of Woodrow's proposed range.   Woodrow assumed an annual net flow of about 200,000 residual foreign born    during the 1980s. 8  She based this figure on previous    research using November 1979, April 1983, June 1986, June 1988, and November    1989 CPS data. With each new CPS supplement Woodrow supported the range of between    100,000 and 300,000 net annual growth in the residual foreign-born population.    In her 1991 report, Woodrow cautioned the interpretation and use of  her preliminary estimates citing the following issues:      Accuracy of the prior research (e.g., 2.1 million residual foreign-born      persons counted in the 1980 census);     Additional (and unaccounted for) categories of foreign born in the  U.S.;    Assumptions about the foreign-born undercount;    Lack of availability (at the time of her research) of 1990 census data; and     Definition and applicability of ""usual place of residence"" to this population          Method 2: Ahmed's Preliminary Estimates of the Residual Foreign    Born Counted in the 1990 Census     Following the preliminary Woodrow report (1991), 1990 census results were    used to improve residual techniques. In the early 1990s, Bureau work on unauthorized    migration (Fernandez, E.W. and J.G. Robinson, 1994; Robinson, J.G., 1994) and    emigration (Ahmed, B. and J.G. Robinson, 1994) led to the first extensive internal    report regarding the residual equation and how components were derived to estimate    an unauthorized population counted in the 1990 census.    Assuming no coverage or estimation error in the census or in the components,    Ahmed (1995) estimated that 942,000 residual foreign born were counted in the    1990 census. This figure is well below the 3.3 million total residual foreign-born    population put forward in Method 1 by Woodrow (1991), as well as Woodrow's estimated    2.1 million enumerated residual foreign-born population as of 1990.    The Ahmed method uses residual techniques based on the 1990 decennial census,    INS data on legal admissions and IRCA legalizations, and components of change.    The 1990 census data represent the counted foreign-born population as of April    1, 1990, whereas the other components yield the expected legal population at    the census date. These include the number of legal immigrants and refugees (and    deaths to and emigration of these populations), foreign students, and persons    illegally present who legalized under IRCA. 9     This technique assumes that the difference between the census-based total foreign-born    estimate and the legal population will reflect the residual foreign-born population    as counted in the 1990 census.    In his estimates, Ahmed restricts his population to those who entered  between 1980 and 1990.  This has an effect on both the legal and  IRCA-legalized population estimates used in his method.   The legal population (on the INS legal admissions files) consists of  both new arrivals and adjustees.  The new arrivals' year of entry is  assumed to be that of the INS file; in other words, those new arrivals  included in the 1980 INS file are assumed to have entered the U.S. in  1980.  Adjustees were present in the U.S. prior to admission to permanent  legal status, and have years of entry earlier than the year in which  they appear on the INS files.  Ahmed does not take this into account,  but assumes that the new arrivals  and  the adjustees have years  of entry corresponding the INS file year.   The IRCA-legalized population who entered the U.S. prior to 1980 was also    excluded from his method. 10  He states an assumption    that anyone who had come before 1980 would have been legalized under IRCA. However,    the LAW population (pre-1982 entrants) would for the most part have entered    the U.S. prior to 1980 (given the pre-1982 requirements as set in the IRCA legislation),    and would be excluded from the 1980-1990 restricted universe in Ahmed's work.    Had Ahmed included this population, his estimates of the residual foreign-born    population would have been even lower, as this IRCA-legalized component is part    of the legal population subtracted from the total foreign-born population counted    in the census.    For a comparable universe, the legal immigrant population (in the INS Legal    Permanent Resident files) should have been restricted to the legal immigrant    population with years of entry 1980 to 1990. By including the additional persons    (who adjusted from a nonimmigrant status, but who arrived prior to 1980) in    the legal population yields a significantly decreased residual foreign-born    population count.    In his calculations of legal immigration from the INS legal admissions  files, Ahmed appears to have included an additional quarter of admissions  (adding January through March 1980).  The addition of this extra quarter  incorrectly overestimates the legal population.   Unlike the DAPE Method (discussed below), Ahmed does not apply emigration  and death rates to the IRCA-legalized population as he does with the  legal population.  Fortunately, Ahmed does age the IRCA-legalized  population an average of two years (from an averaged application year  of 1988) to April 1990.   Ahmed restricted the temporary migrant population to the foreign student population    for his work. Had this population been more broadly defined (to include other    temporary residents such as H-1B workers) the overall residual foreign-born    population estimate would have been lower.    The Ahmed estimates were never incorporated into any  official estimates produced by the Census Bureau.          Method 3 (1990): DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born Population,    1990     The 1990 residual foreign-born estimate was calculated in conjunction with    estimates of other components of international migration: legal permanent migration    and legal temporary migration. These ""known"" components of international migration,    along with assumed deaths and emigrants, are subtracted from a total foreign-born    population yielding a residual count.     This residual foreign-born population    is not an estimate of the number of unauthorized migrants. This estimate also    includes people who are here legally but are not yet included in the official    estimates of legal migrants and refugees. It also includes people in ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Because the    estimate was derived from a residual methodology, any limitations in the methods    or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected in the residual    number. In addition, our assumptions include a great deal of uncertainty, especially    for small migration components. Therefore, the residual may be quite different    from the actual number of unauthorized migrants.   Numbers presented here are based on the entire residual foreign-born population    (including some legal populations such as refugees and asylum applicants). Characteristics    attributable to the residual foreign born may not be the same as for the unauthorized    migrant population.    The DAPE Team estimates 3,765,906 residual foreign born were counted in the    1990 census. Adjusting for an assumed 15-percent net undercount rate, we estimate    that as of April 1, 1990 the total residual foreign-born population would be    4,430,478. Adjusting for an assumed 20-percent net undercount rate, the estimated    1990 residual foreign-born population would be 4,707,383.    (Table A-1 of  Appendix A  shows the total residual foreign-born    population as of April 1, 1990 by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, but recall    that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)   The foreign-born population can be depicted as:    FB = L + U    where  FB  is the total foreign born, and  L  and  U   are the legal and unauthorized migrant components, respectively.   The residual foreign-born population in 1990 (R 1990 ) was  estimated using the following formula:              R 1990  =         [R 1980  - (E 1980-1990  + D 1980-1990 )]        + FB 1980-1990  - [(LPR 1980-1990  + IRCA 1980-1990 )        - (E 1980-1990  + D 1980-1990 )] - T 1987-1990          where a 1980-based estimate of the residual foreign born (R 1980 )    is carried forward to April 1, 1990 through emigration and death.  FB     is the 1990 Census total foreign born who entered the U.S. between 1980 and    1990.  LPR  is the legal permanent residents (legal admissions) component    for the 1980-1990 period and  IRCA  refers to the IRCA-legalized population.    These two ""legal"" populations are carried forward to April 1, 1990 through  E     (emigration) and  D  (death). 11      T  refers to temporary migrants (nonimmigrants) who are not  affected by emigration or death because they are assumed to be  continuously replaced by new temporary migrants of similar  characteristics. The years of entry were limited to the past three  years (1987-1990) to reflect the short-term residence of most temporary  migrants. 12    Similar to Method 2 discussed earlier, the DAPE Method uses residual techniques    based on the 1990 decennial census, INS data on legal admissions, and components    of change. The 1990 census data represent the  counted  foreign-born    population as of April 1, 1990, whereas the latter two components yield the     expected  legal population at the census date. These include the number    of legal migrants (including most refugees who adjusted to LPR status), temporary    migrants, and people illegally present who legalized under IRCA, 13     deaths to and emigration of legal migrants and the IRCA-legalized population.    This technique relies on the simple assumption that the difference between the    census-based total foreign-born estimate and the legal population will reflect    the size of the residual foreign-born population on the census date.    Adjustments were necessary to address errors in the two primary sets  of data, the census data and the INS figures.  Any response misreporting,  such as citizenship status, through a misinterpretation of the question  being asked or through an intentional misrepresentation, is not  addressed by this method.   About 900,000 refugees were estimated to have entered the U.S. during  the 1980s.  Approximately 800,000 adjusted status during this period.   The remaining 100,000 are assumed to be included in the residual amount  shown here. 14     Unauthorized Population Universe    One of the major problems in measuring unauthorized migration is defining    the population. Of the unauthorized migrants physically present in the U.S.    at any given time, some proportion would not be considered ""usual residents""    of the United States according to the definitions of enumeration used in the    U.S. census. It is assumed that the DAPE Method does not include ""sojourner""    or ""commuter"" migrants-people who enter the U.S. for temporary (even daily)    lengths of stay. (See Passel (1988) for more information.)     1990 Census Modified Sample File    A 1990 sample file was created for use by all DAPE teams working on  international migration components.  This file contains race, Hispanic  origin, sex, age, place of birth, citizenship status, and other  information.  Race and Hispanic origin were assigned, based on the  1990 sample file distribution of the foreign born who entered the U.S.  between 1980 and 1990, to components that did not have these  characteristics.   This allocation method proportionally assigned race and Hispanic  origin by place of birth, year of entry, age, and sex of the  foreign born. 15    People for whom no place of birth was reported (808,158 weighted cases)  were assigned a place of birth based on the proportional distribution  by state of the foreign-born population with reported place of birth  in the 1990 sample file.   The total foreign-born population estimate from the 1990 census file,  used in these calculations, is 19,767,316. 16   For the purpose  of this analysis, the foreign-born population was restricted to those  whose year of entry into the U.S. was between 1980 and 1990 (8,663,627).   For the year of entry question on the 1990 census, a multiple-choice  format that offered ten pre-determined entry periods of various  durations was used.  However, the Census 2000 questionnaire provided  a write-in field limited to four spaces to represent the actual year  of arrival.    Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) - INS Administrative Records,  1980-1990 17    The LPR files used for this analysis were created from the INS microdata  where some allocations for age and sex have been made.  The fiscal  year-based INS files (October 1 st  to September 30 th )  have been converted to ""census years,"" April 1 st  to March  31 st .   For new arrival cases, year of admission (into legal permanent resident  status) was assumed to equal year of entry into the U.S.  For adjustees,  year of nonimmigrant admission has been used in place of year of  admission for year of entry into the U.S. as these people resided in  the U.S. prior to obtaining LPR status.  Of these cases, anyone with a  year of entry prior to 1980 has been excluded from our analysis (542,245  cases).   Although some researchers have questioned the completeness of the records    in the INS LPR files (Warren and Passel, 1987), we have not assessed the quality    of the INS data for this project. Instead, we recognize that any incompleteness    could lead to some legal residents being included in the residual foreign-born    estimate.    IRCA-Legalized Population (LAWs (INA Section 245A) & SAWs (INA Section    210))     IRCA-legalized data for our 1990 estimates come from the 1992 Legalization    Summary Public Use Tape (LSPUT) file of IRCA LAWs and SAWs, processed through    August 12, 1992. 18  The file consists of 3,040,948    applications (1,763,434 LAWs and 1,277,514 SAWs). Of these, 1,031,404 LAWs (58.5    percent) and 1,256,015 SAWs (98.3 percent) entered the U.S. between 1980 and    1990. Our 1990 estimate included only those people who were granted LPR status    through August 12, 1992 (942,078 LAWs and 1,057,293 SAWs). Our 2000 estimate    (described below) included those cases processed throughout the remainder of    the 1990s.    For the DAPE Method we assume that all the SAWs were resident in the  United States as of Census Day, April 1, 1990.  Of the 1.3 million SAW  applications for legalization, 9,177 (0.7 percent) had a state of  residence outside the 50 States and Washington, DC. (Smith, et al.,  1996)  Other researchers have taken different approaches to address  the issue of whether SAWs were present or not at the time of the census,  assuming that some portion of the SAW population (certainly greater  than 0.7 percent) was not present in the U.S. at the time of the 1990  census. (Woodrow, 1991; Clark et al., 1994; Bean, 2001)   Pending cases (22,906 LAWs and 18,144 SAWs), who entered the U.S. between    1980 and 1990 are not counted in the IRCA-legalized population for our 1990    estimate, and, therefore, are included in the unauthorized population count    for 1990. Denied cases are assumed to be counted in this residual-based foreign-born    estimate as well.    Because the age of IRCA applicants was recorded as their age at the  date of application, we aged this population two years to the census  date, April 1, 1990.  The period of application for LAWs was May 5,  1987 to May 4, 1988, and June 1, 1987 to November 30, 1988 for SAWs.   The LSPUT file contains incomplete data on race and Hispanic origin  detail for the IRCA-legalized population.  Therefore, we have assigned  these characteristics, based on the foreign born whose entrance to the  U.S. was 1980 to 1990 from the 1990 Census Modified Sample File, by  age, sex, country of birth, year of entry, and citizenship status  (non-citizens only).    Death to and Emigration of Legal and IRCA-Legalized Populations     Calculations of mortality and emigration rates were based on information provided    by the Emigration DAPE Team. 19  This team developed    the assumptions used for estimating emigration and mortality of the foreign    born.   For estimating emigration, rates were assigned by age, sex, race, Hispanic    origin, and country of birth. For estimating mortality, for each year of entry    (beginning in 1980), survival rates were calculated by age group according to    amount of time between year (time) of entry and the census year (for instance,    age 0 in mid-year 1980 would have 9.75 years exposure through April 1990). 20      Temporary Migrants (Nonimmigrants) 21     For the 1990 estimates of international migration, data on temporary  migrants come from the 1990 Census Modified Sample file.  People were  considered to be temporary migrants depending on their education  (attainment and school enrollment), industry, occupation, employment  status, income, age, year of entry, and household relationship.   Not all countries are included (for example, Cuba and USSR), because  people from those countries were assumed to most likely be refugees,  and therefore were not counted as temporary migrants.   According to the Temporary Migrant DAPE research, 487,453 temporary  migrants were counted in the 1990 census.    1980 Residual Foreign-Born Population Carried Forward to 1990     For our 1980 residual foreign-born population base, we relied on figures  that Passel (1988) provided for his 1980 census-enumerated unauthorized  population estimates.  Passel estimated that about 2.1 million  unauthorized migrants were included in the 1980 census (1.1 million  men and 1.0 million women).   We allocated age, country of birth, race, and Hispanic origin to this population    from the 1990 sample file distribution of the foreign born who entered the U.S.    prior to 1980. This estimate was carried forward to April 1990 through emigration    and death yielding a residual foreign-born population estimate of 1,770,505.    Some unauthorized migrants, included in the 1980 estimate, would eventually    acquire legal status through IRCA in the 1980s. These migrants have not been    removed from the 1980 estimate carried forward to 1990, and thus the result    is a residual foreign-born rather than an unauthorized population as of 1990. 22  (See the  Limitations  section    of this report.)     Undercount Rates    Previous research on estimating unauthorized migration have included  varying assumptions about the undercount of the foreign-born population  and the rates of undercoverage by legal status. (Passel, 1988; Woodrow,  1991; Bean, 2001)  Rates of undercount in the census for the unauthorized  population have been assumed to be higher than for the legal population,  and have generally fallen between 15 and 20 percent, with undercount  rates for men being higher than for women. (Bean, 2001)    Appendix A  includes four tables (A-1a, A-1b, A-2a, A-2b)    showing our estimated 1990 residual foreign-born population by age, sex, race,    and Hispanic origin with assumed rates of undercount at 15 and 20 percent. These    rates were simply applied to the residual foreign-born population estimates    shown in  Table A-1 , and were not integrated into the development    of the estimates themselves.           Method 3 (2000): DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born Population,    2000     The 2000-based estimates of the residual foreign born were calculated  using the 1990 methodology (for the 1980 to 1990 period)  plus   the resulting 1990 estimate carried forward to April 1, 2000.  As with  the 1990 estimates, unauthorized migrants  and  quasi-legal  migrants (e.g., refugees/asylees not adjusted to LPR status) are  included in the residual-based estimate.   Our initial attempt at estimating the quasi-legal migrant population  suggests that about 1.7 million (19.5 percent) were included in the  residual foreign born estimate for 2000.  This estimate includes  (estimated number):     refugees (who have not yet adjusted status) and asylum applicants (awaiting      claim adjudication) (200,000 and 400,000, respectively)     migrants deported during the decade (200,000)     population legalizing (adjusting status) during the decade (900,000)     Numbers presented here are based on the entire residual foreign-born population    (including some legal populations such as refugees and asylum applicants). Characteristics    attributable to the residual foreign born may not be the same as for the unauthorized    migrant population.    The DAPE Team estimates 8,705,419 residual foreign born were counted in the    2000 census. Adjusting for undercount, we estimate that as of April 1, 2000    the total residual foreign-born population was 10,241,669 (15 percent undercount).    This estimate was used for the revised DA estimate for 2000.    (Table A-3 of  Appendix A  shows the total residual foreign-born    population as of April 1, 2000 by age, sex, and race and Hispanic origin, but    recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)     1990 Methodology Applied to 2000    Our 2000 method uses residual techniques based on preliminary 2000 census    data, INS data on legal admissions 1990 to 2000, 23     and components of change. The 2000 census data represent the  counted     foreign-born population as of April 1, 2000, whereas the latter two components    yield the  expected  legal population at the census date. These include    the number of legal migrants (including most refugees who adjusted to LPR status),    temporary migrants, and persons illegally present who legalized under IRCA who    were processed  after  August 12, 1992, 24     deaths to and emigration of legal migrants and the IRCA-legalized population.    This technique relies on the simple assumption that the difference between the    census-based total foreign-born estimate and the legal population will reflect    the size of the residual foreign-born population on the census date.     2000 Census Preliminary Sample File    The total foreign-born population estimate from the Census 2000 Preliminary    Sample File, used in these calculations, was 31,098,946. 25     For the 2000 estimates, the foreign-born population was restricted to those    whose year of entry into the U.S. was between April 1990 and March 2000 (12,518,098).    The Census 2000 file used for these estimates (and those of other international    migration components in the DAPE project) may differ from final census files    processed later in 2001/2002. 26      1990 Residual Foreign-Born Population Carried Forward to 2000    The 1990 estimate of  3,765,906  should be reduced due to death    (162,830), emigration (391,275), and adjustment of status of the 1990 unauthorized    migrants included in the 1990 residual foreign-born population who adjusted    throughout the 1990s (about 900,000). However, the population legalizing during    the decade was not removed from this 1990 residual foreign-born population carried    forward to 2000. 27          Limitations    Although the residual technique used to derive estimates of residual foreign    born is based on the simple idea of subtracting the expected legal population    from the counted foreign-born population at the census date, the approach suffers    from a number of limitations. These limitations stem from anomalies and shortcomings    in the data sets used, assumptions made to correct for data deficiencies or    to derive estimates, and the exclusion of components that may prove to be relevant    in the changing migration environment.     Inclusion of Quasi-Legal Migrants in the Residual Foreign-Born Estimate    The most important limitation to the methodology and the resulting estimates    described in this report pertains to the inclusion of quasi-legal migrants (e.g.,    refugees not adjusted for LPR status) in the residual foreign-born estimate.    This limitation appears to have a greater impact on the 2000 estimate than on    the 1990 estimate. This is actually not a limitation for the use of this estimate    in calculating coverage as legal status is not relevant.     Data Quality and Other Data Source Limitations    The precision of our results will depend upon the quality and  completeness of the data used, namely the decennial census files, and  the administrative records of legal and IRCA-legalized populations  provided by the INS.   Other data source limitations include:     For the 2000 estimate, final Census 2000 sample data were not      available at the time of this project    Individual years-of-entry from 1990 census were unattainable      given questionnaire response options    Accuracy of 1980 residual foreign-born estimate was unknown     Emigration and mortality rates were assumed to be the same      regardless of legal status    Methodological Limitations       Limitations of other international migration components are carried over      into our estimates;     Flow (INS) data were modified to be combined with stock (Census) data;     For calculations, assumed 100 percent census coverage of foreign born regardless      of legal status;     For the 1990 estimate, assume 100 percent of SAWs were present in U.S. on      April 1, 1990;     Some ""humanitarian"" populations (i.e., non-adjusted refugees and asylum      applicants) were omitted from legal population, and, therefore, included in      residual foreign-born count;     IRCA-legalized 1990 estimate was restricted to people granted permanent      legal status (Phase II decisions); pending cases were included in the residual      foreign born in 1990 estimate;     Applicability of ""usual residence"" unclear for migrants;    Assumed no difference in race or Hispanic origin identification between      administrative records and census;    Approximated characteristics of the 1980 unauthorized migrant      population based on the foreign born who reported pre-1980 entries      in the 1990 Census.    Time Constraints    The DAPE project began in late April 2001, and was originally scheduled for    completion by July 31, 2001. Extensions were granted through September 10 th     for the DAPE task of estimating the residual foreign-born population as of 1990    and 2000.    However, lack of detailed, historical documentation on both source  files and assumptions and methods led to delays in meeting the  milestones of the overall project timeline.  In addition, several  technical obstacles resulted due to limited documentation.   Comparisons of our 1990 estimates with the official (original) 1990 DA  work by Woodrow (1991) could not be made given different data sources  and limited time to replicate her CPS-based work while preparing our  census and administrative records-based estimates.   Therefore, future work should include a validation of the 1990 DA work  by Woodrow, along with additional research into alternative methods  and data by other researchers working on this issue.  (Espenshade,  1995a; Passel, 1998; Warren, 2000; Bean, 2001)    Impact of Legislation on Migratory Patterns and Quality of Data  Collection    Legislation such as IRCA and more recent legislation in the 1990s  including the changes to the Immigration & Nationality Act (INA)  in 1990 and migration-related legislative changes in 1996 (e.g., Illegal  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) (Pub. L.  104-208); Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) (Pub.  L. 104-132) impact both migratory patterns and the quality of data  collection.  Movement across borders (and into legal statuses) are  facilitated and impeded by legislation.  Data collection instruments  and the type of data collected also change with new legislation.  These  changes, such as with the IRCA legalizations (and related data), affect  our estimates as well.    Undercount Rates    Undercount rates are used in this report only for illustrative purposes.   Nowhere within this report has there been a comprehensive evaluation  of undercount rates for the foreign-born population by legal status or  otherwise.  Our 1990 and 2000 estimates are shown in   Appendix A  tables for both census (enumerated) and DA (""true"" or resident) levels.  In line with contemporary research on undercoverage of the foreign born, undercount rates of 15 and 20 percent (DA level estimates) are presented along with the census-level estimates of the residual foreign-born population as of 1990 and 2000.   From all appearances, the 2000 census is more complete and accurate  than 1990.  The advertising campaign, partnership programs, and use of  the Master Address File (MAF) may have contributed to the improved  coverage of the 2000 census.   Assessing the coverage of the foreign-born and both the legal and residual    foreign-born populations is important to developing improved estimates of each    population. As part of the Post Enumeration Survey (PES) for the 1990 census,    undercount rates were not calculated for the foreign born in particular. Race    and Hispanic origin-specific rates were derived that can be used to approximate    such rates for the foreign born. Harder still is the development of undercount    rates by legal status. Again, researchers outside the Census Bureau have analyzed    this issue and have provided their own rates by legal status. (Binational Study,    1997; Bean, 2001).    Anecdotal evidence suggests that census coverage improved between the 1990    and 2000 decennial censuses. Hence, undercount rates for the unauthorized migrant    population are assumed to have improved between 1990 and 2000. 28      IRCA-Legalized Population     Our 1990 residual foreign-born population estimate includes the IRCA-legalized    population through August 12, 1992. People granted legal status  after     April 1, 1990 (but before August 13, 1992) would be included in our 1990 residual-based    estimate as legal, thereby reducing the ""true"" unauthorized population present    on Census Day, April 1, 1990.         Results    We put forward estimates of the residual foreign-born population residing    in the United States as of April 1, 1990 and April 1, 2000, as shown below in    Table 1.    Table 1.

This estimate also includes ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Any limitations    in the methods or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected    in the residual number.  1990 Estimates     According to our calculations shown above in Table 1, the estimated  residual foreign-born population counted in the 1990 census was   3,765,906 .  Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate  yields a residual foreign-born population of 4,430,478 in 1990.   Of the 3.8 million, 1.8 million (48.4 percent) were male (Table A-1);  1.2 million (32.8 percent) were ages 18 to 29 (Table A-1); 3.5 million  (92.2 percent) were Nonblack (Table A-1); 1.9 million (50.7 percent)  were Hispanic (Table A-2); and 1.0 million (26.8 percent) were from  Mexico (Table A-7).    2000 Estimates    According to our calculations shown above in Table 1, the estimated residual    foreign-born population counted in the 2000 census was  8,705,419 .    Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate yields a residual foreign-born population    of 10,241,669 in 2000.    Of the 8.7 million, 4.7 million (54.2 percent) were male (Table A-3);  3.5 million  (40.0 percent) were ages 18 to 29 (Table A-3); 8.1 million  (93.0 percent) were Nonblack (Table A-3); 5.4 million (61.5 percent)  were Hispanic (Table A-4); and 3.9 million (44.5 percent) were from  Mexico (Table A-8).   (See  Appendix A  for extensive detail by age, sex, race,    Hispanic origin, and place (country) of birth for both 1990 and 2000 estimates,    but recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)    Our new 1990 estimate, also with an assumed undercount rate of 25 percent,    is 5.0 million, well above the Woodrow 1990 DA figure of 3.3 million. 29     To clarify, Woodrow's DA estimate was computed based on November 1989 CPS data,    prior to the availability of the 1990 census sample files.    Our estimates are based on a modified 1990 census sample file, and  include legal migrants not explicitly accounted for in other legal  migrant components of this project.    Comparing the DAPE 1990 and 2000 Estimates with Other Findings (Woodrow,    1991; Ahmed, 1995; Warren, unpublished; Bean, 2001; Passel, 2001)     Although not included here, a comprehensive analysis of our estimates would    comprise an evaluation beyond total population counts to include reviews by    specific countries of birth, age, sex, race/Hispanic origin, year of entry,    and other components of migration (used to derive these estimates). 30     Even though the sources used similar techniques, estimates of the size of    the residual foreign-born population varied widely. Ahmed (Method 2) placed    the figure at 942,000 while Woodrow (Method 1) found the number to be 2.1 million     counted  in the 1990 census. 31     Discrepancies among estimates, in comparing our 1990 estimates with  both Ahmed (1995) and Woodrow (1991), can be summarized as follows:      Adjustments for Undercount : Not all methods included an adjustment      for undercount of the foreign born or by legal status. Neither the DAPE Method      nor Ahmed's make assumptions about undercount in the calculations of the residual      foreign-born population. Woodrow (1991) assumes undercoverage in the census      and makes allowances for sampling and estimation error in the CPS.            Death and Emigration : Estimates of deaths to and emigration of legal      immigrants were calculated for both Method 1 and Method 2, but figures were      not always incorporated in the calculations of the residual foreign-born population.            IRCA LAWs and SAWs : The figures for LAWs and SAWs differed greatly      from one source to another. These differences may account for significant      discrepancies in the estimates of the residual foreign-born population across      methods.            Country-Specific (Negative) Estimates : While the range of derived      figures for the residual foreign-born population may be plausible, evaluating      the total number reveals some inconsistencies. For a number of countries the      estimates are negative, and this is true across methods. On the other hand,      the derived estimates for other countries seem over-estimated. For example,      the Ahmed report places the size of residual foreign-born population from      Mexico at about 160,000 or 17 percent, which appears to be low. We estimated      that 27 percent of the residual foreign born in 1990 was from Mexico; our      2000 estimate was closer to 45 percent from Mexico. Most studies indicate      that Mexico constitutes a substantial proportion of the unauthorized population,      around 55 percent. (Warren, 2000; Bean, 2001)      In comparison with our 2000 estimate, Warren (unpublished) suggests  6.7 million unauthorized migrants were counted in the 2000 census, and  that when undercount of the foreign born was taken into consideration  (by legal status) the unauthorized resident population count rose to  7.6 million.   Bean (2001) estimates about 2.5 million Mexicans were residing in the U.S.    in March 1996 yielding an estimated 3.9 million unauthorized migrants from Mexico    (when carried forward to March 2000). Through our calculations of the counted    residual foreign born in 2000, we estimated 3.9 million Mexicans (44.5 percent    of the residual foreign born in 2000). 32  Bean    also estimates a total unauthorized population of about 7.1 million in 2000.    According to the 1990 residual results, the 18-49 age group accounts for 58    percent of the total population; for the 2000 estimate the proportion of the    same age group is 70 percent.    Analysis of the sex structure, on the other hand, shows the number of residual    foreign-born women greater than the number of residual foreign-born men in 1990;    for the 2000 results, more residual foreign-born men were living in the country.    The greater number of women in 1990 was unexpected as migrants were disproportionately    male, but it may be attributed to the effect of the IRCA legalization program.    Because more men benefited from the amnesty than women and were subsequently    allowed to bring their families to the U.S., it is conceivable that the number    of residual foreign-born women was higher than the number of residual foreign-born    men in 1990. This explanation is consistent with the higher number of Hispanic    women aged 18 to 49.         Next Steps - Improvements in Current Approach and Alternative  Methods of Measurement    Research will be conducted in the near future on the extent to which  the 1990 and 2000 estimates can be revised to more accurately reflect  the unauthorized migrant component of the residual foreign-born  population.  Some minor changes are readily apparent and relatively  simple to incorporate into the current methodology.   Our selection of a single method by which to estimate the unauthorized population    for the DAPE task should not be misinterpreted as a clear preference for one    methodology.    The DAPE project was endeavored to be an ""integrated"" process. In other words,    all of the task teams that were responsible for estimating a single component    of international migration (e.g., legal, unauthorized, and temporary migrants,    and emigrants) were required to integrate their work (methods, assumptions,    and data sources) wherever possible.    Estimates of unauthorized migration (flow) and unauthorized migrants  (stock) that use alternative data sources (e.g., apprehensions data  (Espenshade, (1995a); 3-Card Method (GAO, 1998)) should be explored to  test the validity and reliability of the estimates produced here.   Alternative assumptions and methods developed outside the Bureau should  be examined more closely as well.  Warren (2000 and unpublished), Bean  (2001), and Passel (1998 and 2001) have provided extensive detail on  the estimation of the unauthorized population.   Their research provides invaluable information that should be referenced regularly    as the Census Bureau revisits its estimates of the residual foreign-born and    unauthorized migrant populations.        NOTES:   1  Both the Special Agricultural Workers (SAWs) and pre-1982 entrants  (LAWs) were legalized under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA).   2  Assignment of race and Hispanic Origin based on  state-specific foreign-born populations would have been a refinement  of this allocation technique, given the geographic concentration of  the foreign-born population in the U.S.  However, this approach was  not used due to time constraints of this project.   3   ""Residual methods generally were not employed with data  collected before the 1980s because the 1980 census was the first  decennial census in which a sizable  enumerated  unauthorized  migrant population could be detected through demographic analysis.""  (Fay, Passel, and Robinson, 1988 cited in Bean, 2001, p. 412)   4  Earlier Census Bureau documentation used such terms as ""undocumented,""  ""illegal,"" or ""unauthorized migrants."" The methods and the  results supporting these documents were actually reflecting the residual foreign-born  population.    5  See Woodrow-Lafield, K.A. 1991. ""Demographic analysis evaluation  project D2: Preliminary estimates of undocumented residents in 1990."" (1990 Decennial  Census, Preliminary Research & Evaluation Memorandum no. 75) (22 October 1991).     6  This analysis provided the unauthorized population number used for  the 1990 DA. The 1990 DA number was used later in the construction of the 2000  DA estimates released in March 2001.   7  Woodrow (1991) suggested that plausible levels of undercoverage in  the census were between 20 and 30 percent.   8  A net annual flow of 200,000 unauthorized migrants was used in the  Bureau's postcensal population estimates during this period.   9  From the INS IRCA-legalized files, Ahmed selected cases with status  granted or pending and having complete information on age, sex, and country of  birth, year of entry, and intended state of and county of residence: 1,658,986  LAWs and 1,084,233 SAWs. (Ahmed 1995, pgs. 5-6)   10   When describing the LAW and SAW populations Ahmed takes  into account IRCA-legalized people regardless of when they entered the  U.S.  However, in his calculations (shown in the formulas on pages 1  and 8 of his report) he does not appear to include the pre-1980  entrants, a large segment of the LAW population.   11   No legal migrants are assumed to have become  unauthorized during the decade.   12  For more information on the treatment of temporary migrants, see  Working Paper #60.   13   Unlike Ahmed's (1995) method (Method 2 here), this  method does not include cases pending authorization in the  IRCA-legalized population.   14  In evaluating this work in the near future, this  ""humanitarian"" component will be treated separately helping to make  possible a more precise estimate of the unauthorized population.   15  For the DAPE work, countries of birth of the foreign born were grouped  into 40 countries and regions. (See  Appendix A  for tables  with details by place (country) of birth.)   16   Of the total foreign-born population (all years of  entry), 488,570 were in group quarters in 1990.   17  Refer to Working Paper #59 for detailed information on the legal  files used in this analysis.   18  The INS discontinued the data system used to process the IRCA-related  applications through August 12, 1992. By this time, the INS had processed 3.0  million applications or 88 percent of the LAW and 84 percent of the SAW cases.  (Smith, et al., 1996)   19  See Working Paper #62 for detailed information on the emigration  and mortality data and assumptions used in this analysis.   20  Persons 100 years of age and above are assumed to have the same  mortality rates (by sex).   21  Refer to Working Paper #60 for detailed information on temporary  migrants (nonimmigrants).   22  This limitation will also affect the 2000 estimate. (This will be  discussed in greater detail later in this report.)   23  INS data on legal immigrants and refugees are available through  fiscal year 1999 (September 1999). A population as of April 1, 2000 is needed  for our analysis. An October 1999-March 2000 population was estimated using the  distributions of the FY 1999 file.   24  The 2000 method picks up where the 1990 method left off with regard  to the IRCA-legalized population. As of August 12, 1992, 22,906 LAWs and 18,144  SAWs were pending authorization. With the use of published INS data (INS, 2000),  cases identified as pending in the IRCA files were ""matched"" to actual cases approved  post-August 1992. As limited detail was included in the published data, characteristics  were assigned to these cases based on IRCA LSPUT information used in the 1990-based  estimates. It is assumed that the only reason why these cases were pending was  administrative in nature, and, therefore, had no bearing on the applicants' characteristics. 25      25  Of the total foreign-born population (all years of entry), 543,435  were estimated to be in group quarters in 2000.   26  Final edit specifications and weighting schemes had not yet been  fully developed for use in these preliminary sample files.   27  Beginning in October 1994, section 245(i) of the Immigration &  Nationality Act (INA) allowed unauthorized residents who were eligible for legal  immigrant status to remain in the U.S. and adjust to permanent resident status  by applying at an INS office and paying a fee. Prior to October 1994, most unauthorized  residents were required to leave the U.S. and acquire a visa abroad from the Department  of State as they are again now. (INS, pA.3-2, 2000)   28  The revised DA estimates used a 15-percent net undercount rate assumption  for the residual foreign born in 2000, and a 20-percent net undercount rate assumption  for the residual foreign born in 1990.   29  Woodrow's (1991) DA-level estimate of 3.3 million was calculated  based on an assumed 25 percent undercount of unauthorized migrants in the 1990  census.   30  Such a review is forthcoming.   31  As mentioned previously, Woodrow did not make use of 1990 census  data for her estimates. She estimated the residual foreign-born population as  of November 1989 and carried them forward (through emigration and death) to April  1, 1990.   32  Bean assumes that 55 percent of the unauthorized population would  be Mexican in 2000.

The estimates contained in the report,  The Foreign-Born Population in the United States: March 2000,  should not be confused with Census 2000 results, which are scheduled for release over the next three years.    ""About 10 percent of the nation's population was foreign-born in 2000,"" said Lisa Lollock, the report author. ""This proportion is between the high figure of 15 percent reached during a period of heavy immigration from Europe in 1890 and the low of 5 percent in 1970.""    The report said one-third of the foreign-born population was from Mexico or another Central American country and about one-fourth, from Asia.    Other highlights from the report:    -- The foreign-born population are more likely than natives to live in      the West and the Northeast. More than 6 in 10 of the foreign-born      population reside in one of these two regions, compared with less      than 4 in 10 natives.    -- Almost half of the foreign-born population lived in the central city      of a metropolitan area (45 percent) compared with slightly more than      one-quarter of the native population (28 percent). Only 5 percent of      the foreign-born population lived outside metro areas, compared with      21 percent of natives.    -- While foreign-born residents age 25 and over were as likely as      natives to be college graduates (26 percent each), they lagged at      lower educational levels, as 67 percent of the foreign-born population       and 87 percent of natives were high school graduates. Thirty-six      percent of full-time, year-round workers born outside the United      States earned less than $20,000 in 1999; this compares with       21 percent of their native counterparts who were at that level.    -- Foreign-born people were more likely than natives to be 18 to 64      years of age (8 in 10 compared with 6 in 10).    -- Thirty-seven percent of the nation's foreign-born residents were      naturalized citizens. Less than 1 in 10 of the foreign-born people      who entered the United States in the 1990s had become citizens,      compared with 8 in 10 who arrived before 1970.    The report, a slide presentation, an interactive quiz and 60 statistical tables update the 1999 report on the foreign-born population issued last September. The statistics were collected in the March 2000 Current Population Survey, which uses the 1990 census as a base for its sample.    The report contains data on characteristics of the foreign-born population such as region of birth, geographic distribution in the United States, age, citizenship, household size, marital status, educational level, employment status, occupation, earnings and poverty status.

GX100-90-5725893	"*EPF307   01/03/01  Text: Census Bureau on U.S. Foreign Born Population  (Report shows 10 percent of U.S. residents born elsewhere) (700)    The U.S. Census Bureau reported January 3 that 28.4 million U.S. residents were born in other countries, approximately 10 percent.      One-third of the foreign-born population is from Mexico or Central America, according to the report entitled, ""The Foreign-Born Population in the United States: March 2000.""  Another fourth of these residents is from Asia.  More than 60 percent of this population is concentrated in two U.S. regions --- the West and the Northeast.    The Commerce Department's Census Bureau reported December 28 that the national headcount conducted in 2000 revealed a U.S. population of 281,421,906, an increase of 13.2 percent over the 248,709,873 persons counted during the 1990 census.     Following is the text of the Census Bureau press release:     (begin text)    U.S. Census Bureau    JANUARY 3, 2001     Public Information    Foreign-Born Population Nears 30 Million, Census Bureau Estimates    A new report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau today estimates that the nation's foreign-born population in 2000 was 28.4 million about 1 in 10 U.S. residents.    The estimates contained in the report, The Foreign-Born Population in the United States: March 2000, should not be confused with Census 2000 results, which are scheduled for release over the next three years.    ""About 10 percent of the nation's population was foreign-born in 2000,"" said Lisa Lollock, the report author. ""This proportion is between the high figure of 15 percent reached during a period of heavy immigration from Europe in 1890 and the low of 5 percent in 1970.""    The report said one-third of the foreign-born population was from Mexico or another Central American country and about one-fourth, from Asia.    Other highlights from the report:    -- The foreign-born population are more likely than natives to live in the West and the Northeast. More than 6 in 10 of the foreign-born population reside in one of these two regions, compared with less than 4 in 10 natives.    -- Almost half of the foreign-born population lived in the central city of a metropolitan area (45 percent) compared with slightly more than one-quarter of the native population (28 percent). Only 5 percent of the foreign-born population lived outside metro areas, compared with 21 percent of natives.    -- While foreign-born residents age 25 and over were as likely as natives to be college graduates (26 percent each), they lagged at lower educational levels, as 67 percent of the foreign-born population and 87 percent of natives were high school graduates. Thirty-six percent of full-time, year-round workers born outside the United States earned less than $20,000 in 1999; this compares with 21 percent of their native counterparts who were at that level.    -- Foreign-born people were more likely than natives to be 18 to 64 years of age (8 in 10 compared with 6 in 10).    -- Thirty-seven percent of the nation's foreign-born residents were naturalized citizens. Less than 1 in 10 of the foreign-born people who entered the United States in the 1990s had become citizens, compared with 8 in 10 who arrived before 1970.    The report, a slide presentation, an interactive quiz and 60 statistical tables update the 1999 report on the foreign-born population issued last September. The statistics were collected in the March 2000 Current Population Survey, which uses the 1990 census as a base for its sample.    The report contains data on characteristics of the foreign-born population such as region of birth, geographic distribution in the United States, age, citizenship, household size, marital status, educational level, employment status, occupation, earnings and poverty status. Comparisons are made between the foreign-born and the native populations, as well as among the foreign-born population by region of birth, citizenship and year of entry.

This report focuses on Asian Americans Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, Asian Indians, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians, Hmong, and Thai. Pacific Islanders are profiled in a companion report, We, The American Pacific Islanders,"" in this series. For the last two decades, the num ber of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States doubled, from 1.5 million in 1970 to 3.7 million in 1980 to 7.3 million in 1990. The per centage of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the total population also nearly doubled during the 1980's, from 1.5 percent to 2.9 percent. Our dramatic increases are the re sult of increased immigration from China, India, Korea, the Philippines, and other Asian and Pacific Island areas following the adoption of the Immigration Act of 1965. In addition to immigration and natu ral increase, part of the growth of our numbers during the 1970's re flect changes in the census race definition to include more groups, as well as improvements in review pro cedures in the 1990 census.  1   We, the American Asians are a rapidly growing, diverse part of America. The 1990 census counted 6,908,638 Asians, a 99 percent increase over the 1980 census count of 3,466,847. In 1990, the largest proportions of Asian Americans were Chinese (24 percent) and Filipino (20 percent) followed by Japanese, with 12 percent of the Asian population. Newer immigrant groups Laotian, Cambodian, Thai, and Hmong each accounted for 2 percent or less of the Asians in America. Note: All Asian groups, regardless of size, are important and make con tinuing contributions to the diversity of the United States. This discussion focuses on only the 10 largest Asian groups.

Fifty four percent of the Asian population lived in the West in 1990 compared with 21 percent of the total population. Approximately 66 percent of Asians lived in just five States California, New York, Hawaii, Texas, and Illinois. The Asian population was highly concen trated in California, New York, and Hawaii, but the concentra tion varied by Asian groups.  AK  Figure 2.

Immigration has contributed heavily to the growth of the Asian population in the past two decades, but the percentages who are foreign born differ considerably among groups. Sixty six percent of Asians were born in foreign countries. Among Asian groups, Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian groups had the highest proportion of foreign born, while Japanese had the lowest proportion. Thirty eight percent of Asians entered the United States from 1980 to 1990. The Cambodians, Laotians, and Hmong had the highest proportion of persons who entered the United States during this period. The IndoChina Migration and Refugee Assis tance Act of 1975 established a program of re settlement for refugees who fled from Cambodia and Vietnam. One year later, the Immigration Act of 1976 made Laotians eligible for the same refugee resettlement programs. Seventy five percent or more of the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian born entered the country since 1975. We are a young population. Asians had a median age of 30 years in 1990, younger than the national median of 33 years. Only 6 percent of Asians were 65 years old and older compared with 13 percent for the total population. The Japanese were the eldest of the Asian populations with a median age of 36 years, in part because fewer Japanese were foreign born. The Hmong and Cambodian, with their large proportions of recent immigrants were the youngest Asians with a median age of 13 years and 19 years, respectively. Immigrant populations tend to have higher fertility than native populations. In 1990, Asian males were younger than Asian females, with median ages of 29 years and 31 years, respectively, in part because females tend to live longer.  Figure 3.

The average Asian family had 3.8 persons in 1990, larger than the average of 3.2 persons for all U.S. families. Asian families were larger partly because the percentage of children under 18 years old who lived with both parents was higher than the general population, 81 percent versus 70 percent. Among Asian groups, Hmong had the largest family size with 6.6 persons, and Japanese the smallest family size with 3.1 persons. Other groups with more than four persons per family were Filipino, Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian. The proportion of Asian families maintained by a husband and wife was 82 percent, slightly higher than the national figure of 79 percent. The pro portion of Asian female headed families with no husband present was significantly less than the national average, 12 percent versus 17 percent. However, two groups had proportions above the national average: Cambodian, 26 percent and Thai, 20 percent. Our educational attainment varied widely by group. In 1990, 78 percent of all Asians 25 years old and over were at least high school graduates; the national rate was 75 percent. Education is highly valued in Asian communities, but the educational attainment of different groups varied widely. The proportion completing high school or higher was 88 percent for Japanese, compared with 31 percent for Hmong. In general, Asian men had higher rates of high school graduation or higher than Asian women: 82 percent versus 74 percent in 1990. Japanese women had a high school or higher completion rate of 86 percent compared with 19 percent for Hmong women. At the college level, 38 percent of Asians had graduated with a bachelor's degree or higher by 1990, compared with 20 percent of the total pop ulation. Asian Indians had the highest attainment rates, and Cambodians, Laotians, and Hmong had the lowest. 4 Total Asian Hmong Cambodian Laotian Vietnamese Filipino Asian Indian Chinese Korean Thai Japanese Other Asian  Figure 5.

Of the 4.1 million Asians 5 years old and over, 56 percent did not speak English very well,"" and 35 percent were linguistically isolated. The Hmong, Laotians, and Cambodians had the highest proportions of persons 5 years old and over speaking an Asian or Pacific Islander (API) language at home. Asian Indians, at 15 percent, had the lowest proportion. Hmong and Cambodians who spoke an Asian or Pacific Islander language at home had the high est proportion of linguistically isolated, 61 per cent and 56 percent, respectively.  Table 2.

We are more likely to participate in the labor force than the population as a whole. In 1990, 67 percent of Asian Americans, compared with 65 percent of all Americans, were in the labor force. Filipino, Asian Indian, Thai, and Chinese had participation rates higher than the national average 75 percent, 72 percent, 71 percent, and 66 percent, respectively. Asian women had a higher participation rate than all women. Sixty percent of Asian women were in the labor force compared with 57 percent of all women in the United States. Asian men had about the same participation rate as all men, 75 percent and 74 percent, respectively, and Asian Indian men had the largest participation rate of 84 percent.

Among Asian families, Filipinos (30 percent) and Vietnamese, (21 percent) had the highest propor tions of families with three or more workers.  Hmong families had the lowest proportion with three or more workers.  Korean Thai Japanese Cambodian Hmong Other Asian  Many of us work in higher paying occupations, in part because of higher educational attainment.  Figure 8.

Estimated population and hous ing unit totals based on tabulations from only the sample counts may differ from the official 100 percent counts. Such differences result, in part, from collecting data from a sample of households rather than all households. Differences also can occur because of the interview situation and the processing rules differing between the 100 percent and sample tabulations.

Masumura P70-56 June 1996 The state of the economy is an important factor in determining which way these fluctuations go, but it is not the only factor. Changes in personal circumstances also play a significant role. Table 1 shows people had an even (50-50) chance or better of experiencing an income-ratio rise (of 5 percent or more) from one year to the next if, over the course of two years: G They began to work year-round, full-time;  CENSUS  BUREAU Figure 1 demonstrates that, from one year to the next, about onefourth of all Americans had stable income ratios (that is, ratios that change less than 5 percent from year to year). In other words, the large majority (about three-fourths) are subject to considerable income changes from one year to the next, regardless of the stage of the business cycle. Over the course of a lifetime, the average American will experience a number of these shifts. Figure 1.  The great majority of Americans experience significant fluctuations in their economic well-being from one year to the next. About threefourths of the population see their economic well-being go either up or down by at least 5 percent from one year to the next as a result of changes in living arrangements, program participation, work status, or other circumstances.  Income gains were less common in the 1990's than in the 1980's. One measure of economic wellbeing is the income-to-poverty ratio--called the income ratio here--that is, the ratio of a person's annual family income to the family's poverty threshold. Figure 1 describes Americans by whether their income ratios rose or dropped significantly (5 percent or more) or remained about the same (moved less than 5 percent) from one year to the next. Data are shown for six two-year periods. The proportion of persons whose income ratios rose from one year to the next was smaller in the 1990's than in the 1980's, reaching its minimum during the 1990-1991 recession. Conversely, the percentage of people who experienced declines in their income ratios from one year to the next grew larger from the last decade to the present one.

Even though summary measures, such as median income, do not change much in real terms from one year to the next, income ratios do shift for most Americans.

On the other hand, among those at the top of the ladder (families with incomes four or more times the 1992 poverty level), 47 percent experienced declines, while only 30 percent posted gains. Changes in income sources can serve as barometers of changes in economic well-being. Table 2 shows the mere appearance or disappearance of a particular income source can often forecast an improvement or a decline in economic well-being. For instance: G The large majority (72 percent) of persons who lived in  2 households where someone received earnings during 1993, but no one did the previous year, saw their income ratios rise significantly from 1992 to 1993. On the other hand, a similarly high proportion (73 percent) in households with earnings during 1992, but not the next year, posted declines. G Households in which someone received unemployment benefits during 1993, but no one did in 1992, were more likely to experience an income-ratio decline in 1993 (52 percent) than those that received benefits in 1992, but not in 1993 (37 percent). G Two groups of people--Social Security (and railroad retirement income) recipients and those with pensions and private dis-  And where one stands on the income ladder can influence changes too.

GX151-58-9739631	OVERVIEW     Current Population Survey        Introduction    The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of the official Government statistics on employment and unemployment.  The CPS has been conducted monthly for over 50 years.  Currently, we interview about 48,000 households monthly, scientifically selected on the basis of area of residence to represent the Nation as a whole, individual States, and other specified areas.  Each household is interviewed once a month for four consecutive months one year, and again for the corresponding time period a year later.  This technique enables us to obtain month-to-month and year-to-year comparisons at a reasonable cost while minimizing the inconvenience to any one household.   Although the main purpose of the survey is to collect information on the employment situation, a very important secondary purpose is to collect information on the demographic status of the population, information such as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, and family structure.  From time to time additional questions are included on such important subjects as health, education, income, and previous work experience.  The statistics resulting from these questions serve to update similar information collected once every 10 years through the decennial census, and are used by Government policymakers and legislators as important indicators of our Nation's economic situation and for planning and evaluating many Government programs.   The CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of the population of the United States.  Because it is not possible to develop one or two overall figures (such as the number of unemployed) that would adequately describe the labor market, the CPS is designed to provide a large amount of detailed and supplementary data.  Such data are made available to meet a wide variety of needs on the part of users of labor market information.   Thus, the CPS is the only source of monthly estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm); nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid workers in nonfarm family enterprises; wage and salary employees; and, finally, estimates of total unemployment.   It provides the only available distribution of workers by the number of hours worked (as distinguished from aggregate or average hours for an industry), permitting separate analyses of part-time workers, workers on overtime, etc.  The survey is also the only comprehensive current source of information on the occupation of workers and the industries in which they work.  Information is available from the survey not only for persons currently in the labor force but also for those who are outside the labor force.  The characteristics of such persons -- whether married women with or without young children, disabled persons, students, older retired workers, etc., can be determined.  Information on their current desire for work, their past work experience, and their intentions for job seeking are also available.    The March CPS, also known as the Annual Demographic File, contains the basic monthly demographic and labor force data described above, plus additional data on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration.     CPS Sample    The CPS sample is based on the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States.  The sample is located in 792 sample areas comprising 2,007 counties and independent cities with coverage in every State and in the District of Columbia.   In all, some 60,000 housing units or other living quarters are assigned for interview each month; about 48,000 of them containing approximately 94,000 persons 15 years old and over are interviewed.  Also included are demographic data for approximately 28,000 children 0-14 years old and 450 Armed Forces members living with civilians either on or off base within these households.  The remainder of the assigned housing units are found to be vacant, converted to nonresidential use, contain persons with residence elsewhere, or are not interviewed because the residents are not found at home after repeated calls, are temporarily absent, or are unavailable for other reasons.  Approximately 12,000 noninterview households are present each month.  The resulting file size is approximately 136,000 records.  In March of each year supplemental data are collected for Armed Forces members residing with their families in civilian housing units or on a military base.  The Armed Forces members, however, are not asked the monthly labor force questions.  In addition, the March CPS is supplemented with a sample of Hispanic households identified the previous November.  This results in the addition of about 3,000 households (2,500 Interviewed) in the March CPS.  The inclusion of the additional sample of Hispanic households began in 1976.   A more precise explanation regarding the CPS sample design is provided in Technical Paper 40,  The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology.    For a more detailed discussion about the basic labor force data gathered on a monthly basis in the CPS survey, see the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report No. 463 and the Current Population Report P-23, No. 62, issued jointly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census in October, 1976, and entitled Concepts and Methods Used In Labor Statistics derived from the Current Population Survey.     Questionnaire    Questionnaire facsimiles of the March 1997 CPS income supplement are shown in Appendix D in this documentation.       Revisions To The March CPS Processing System    Introduction .  Between 1988 and 1989 a new computer processing system was introduced for the March Current Population Survey.  This processing system rewrite was long overdue; the system in use before this year was first introduced in March 1976 and was never fully updated to reflect the numerous questionnaire changes that had taken place since that time.  In addition, the programs used to process the CPS file were written in a computer language that is being phased out of use at the Census Bureau.  While the March 1989 file is the first to reflect this new processing system, the March 1988 file was reprocessed based on these new procedures in order to: 1) better evaluate the new processing procedures, and 2) allow year-to-year comparisons to be made between income years 1987 and 1988 using a consistent processing system.   While the following section deals mainly with modifications to the March imputation procedures and their subsequent effect on income and poverty rates, it should be pointed out that all of the processing programs were rewritten in 1989, so that not only are the files from 1989 forward based on a somewhat different imputation system, but also reflect a rewritten weighting system, data acceptance program, family relationship edits, and new procedures to match income supplement records to the monthly CPS file.  As a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether differences (especially those based on relatively small bases) are the result of imputation or other processing differences between the original and revised files.   Since the Census Bureau began imputing the missing income data on the CPS in 1962, there have been three major revisions to the processing system (in 1967, 1976, and 1989).  Through all of these revisions, the basic strategy used in make imputations has remained the same.  This approach, commonly referred to as ``hot deck'' imputation, assigns missing responses to sample persons with information from matched sample persons with similar demographic and economic information who answered these questions.   Under the new March processing system, there were three main modifications to the income imputation programs:     1. The edits and imputations were expanded to reflect the full detail of the March income questionnaire.  The original processing system was still based on a less detailed CPS income questionnaire that had not been in use since 1980.     2. Under the revised processing procedures, entire sets of March income and noncash benefits data were imputed to supplement noninterviews from the same interviewed person.  Under the original processing procedures, earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits were imputed in separate stages during the processing system.  Thus, the new processing system imputes noninterviews more efficiently and is better able to preserve the correlation between earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits.      3. Both the old and new processing systems employ what are called ''statistical matches'' to link sample cases with reported data to those requiring imputation for missing responses.  In the original processing system, under certain circumstances, reported data were removed and replaced with imputed data during the statistical matching process.  Under the new system, reported data are never removed.  This was accomplished by expanding the number of statistical matches in the income imputation system.     File Structure    There is a household record for each household or group quarters.  The  household record is followed by one of three possible structures:     A. If the household contains related persons and is not a group quarters household:     1. The family record appears next followed by person records for members of the family who are not also members of a related subfamily.  The person records would be ordered: family householder, spouse of family householder, children in the family, and other relatives of the family householder.     2. The above records may be followed by one or more related subfamily records, each related subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of that related subfamily.  The person records would be ordered:  reference person of the related subfamily, spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily reference person.     3. The above records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily records, each unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of that unrelated subfamily.  The person  records would be ordered:  unrelated subfamily reference person, spouse  of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily reference  person.     4. The above records may be followed by one or more persons living with nonrelatives family records, each to be followed by the person record  for the unrelated individual it represents.  (See Figure 1, page 2-4.)     B. If the household contains a householder with no relatives and is not a group quarters household:     1. The family record for the nonfamily householder is followed immediately  by the person record for that nonfamily householder.     2. These records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily  records, each unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by the person records for members of that unrelated subfamily.     3. These records may be followed by one or more family records for persons living with nonrelatives, each person living with nonrelatives family  record being followed immediately by the person record for that person  living with nonrelatives.  (See Figure 2, page 2-5.)     C. If the household is a group quarters, each person is defined as a person living with nonrelatives.  There will be a family record followed by a person record for each person in the group quarters.      Relationship of Current Population Survey Files to Publications    Each month, a significant amount of information about the labor force is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Employment and Earnings and  Monthly Labor Review Reports.   As mentioned previously, the CPS also serves as a vehicle for supplemental inquiries on subjects other than employment which are periodically added to the  questionnaire.  From the basic and supplemental data the Bureau of the Census issues four series of publications under the general title Current Population  Reports:     P-20  Population Characteristics  P-23  Special Studies    P-27  Farm Population    P-60  Consumer Income     Of particular interest to users of the March microdata file would be those reports based on information collected in March.  These reports include the following titles:     P-20  Population Profile of the United States:  (Year)   P-20  Household and Family Characteristics:  March (Year)    P-20  Households, Families, Marital Status, and Living Arrangements:  March (Year)    P-20  Geographical Mobility (Years)    P-20  Educational Attainment in the United States (Years)  P-20  Persons of Hispanic Origin in the United States (Year)     P-60  Money Income and Poverty Status of Families and Persons in the United States:  (Year)  P-60  Characteristics of the Population Below the Poverty Level:  (Year)    P-60  Characteristics of Households Receiving Selected Noncash Benefits:  (Year)     All Current Population Reports may be obtained by subscription from the U.S. Government Printing Office.  Subscriptions are available as follows:  Population Characteristics, Special Studies, Farm    Population, and Consumer  Income series (P-20,    P-23, P-27, P-60) combined, $71 per year (sold as a  package only);  Population Estimates and Projections (P-25), $25 per year.  Single issues may be ordered separately; ordering information and prices are in the  Bureau of the Census Catalog  and  Guide , in  Census   and   You , and the  Monthly Product Announcement  (MPA).

NOTE:  Each person in group quarters is by definition a person living with nonrelatives.      Geographic Limitations    One set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files should be treated with caution.  These are estimates for individual metropolitan areas.  Although estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth, should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000) should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling variability associated with these estimates.  For these areas, estimates comparing percent distributions and ratios will provide data with less sampling variability than estimates of levels will.   It should be kept in mind that the sample design and methods of weighting CPS data are geared towards producing estimates for the entire Nation.  Consequently, data for states are not as reliable as national data, and the file will lose some of its utility in certain applications.  For further discussion of such considerations, the user should consult  The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology  (Technical Paper 40, U.S. Bureau of the Census).   The nature of the work done by each individual investigator using the microdata file will determine to what extent his/her requirements for precision will allow using some of the smaller geographic areas identified on the file.     Weights    For all CPS data files a single weight is prepared and used to compute the monthly labor force status estimates.  An additional weight was prepared for the earnings universe which roughly corresponds to wage and salary workers in the two outgoing rotations.  This is explained below in the section on earnings data.  However, the difference in content of the March CPS supplement requires the presentation of additional weights:  a household weight, a family weight, and a March supplement weight.  In this section we briefly describe the construction and use of these weights.  Chapter 5 of Technical paper 40, The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology provides documentation of the weighting procedures for the CPS both with and without supplement questions.   The final weight, which is the product of several adjustments, is used to produce population estimates for the various items covered in the regular monthly CPS.  This weight is constructed from the basic weight for each person, which represents the probability of selection for the survey.  The basic weight is adjusted for special sampling situations and failure to obtain interviews from eligible households (noninterview adjustment).  A two-stage ratio estimation procedure adjusts the sample population to the known distribution of the entire population.  This two-stage ratio estimation process produces factors which are applied to the basic weight (after the special weighting and noninterview adjustments are made) and results in the final weight associated with each record.  In summary, the final weight is the product of:  (1) the basic weight, (2) adjustments for special weighting, (3) noninterview adjustment, (4) first stage ratio adjustment factor, and (5) second stage ratio adjustment factor.  This final weight should be used when producing estimates from the basic CPS data.   Differences in the questionnaire, sample and data uses for the March CPS supplement result in the need for additional adjustment procedures to produce what is called the March supplement weight.  The sample for the March CPS supplement is expanded to include male members of the Armed Forces who are living in civilian housing or with the family on a military base, as well as additional Hispanic households which are not included in the monthly labor force estimates.     The expanded sample and the need to have a husband and wife receive the same weight has resulted in a weighting system which produces the March supplement weight.  The March supplement weight should be used for producing estimates from March supplement data.   Finally, household and family weights are the weights assigned from the householder or reference person after all adjustments have been made and should be used when tabulating estimates of families-households.     Earnings Data    Beginning in 1982, usual hourly and weekly earnings data appear on the Annual Demographic File (ADF) for that portion of the population roughly corresponding to wage and salary workers (self-employed persons in incorporated businesses are excluded, although they are normally included with the wage and salary population).  These data are now collected on a monthly basis in the two outgoing rotation groups as part of the basic CPS labor force interview.   Since the intent of the regular collection of earnings data was to initiate a family earnings data series, all persons in the two outgoing rotations receive an ''earnings weight,'' even if they are not eligible for the earnings item.  The earnings weight is a simple ratio-estimation to the person's labor force status by age, race, and sex.  When tabulating estimates of earnings based on basic CPS data, use the earnings weight.   Further information on this earnings series is contained in  Technical Description of the Quarterly Data on Weekly Earnings from the Current Population Survey,  BLS Report #601, July 1980.  This report is available on request from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, D.C.  20212.  Attn:  Office of Inquiries and Correspondence.   NOTE:  For 1982 and 1983, usual weekly earnings are not present for individuals who were not paid on an hourly basis.

   union affiliation but whose jobs are covered by a union or an employee association contract.        3 Beginning in 2003, persons who selected this race group only; persons who selected more than one race group are not      included. Prior to 2003, persons who reported more than one race group were included in the group they identified as their      main race.        NOTE:  Data for 2002 have been revised to incorporate changes to the class of worker status associated with the      introduction of the 2002 Census industry and occupational classification systems into the Current Population Survey.       Beginning in January 2003, data reflect revised population controls used in the household survey.  Estimates for the above      race groups (white, black or African American, and Asian) do not sum to totals because data are not presented for all races.      In addition, persons whose ethnicity is identified as ""Hispanic or Latino"" may be of any race and, therefore, are classified      by ethnicity as well as race.  Data refer to the sole or principal job of full- and part-time workers.  Excluded are all      self-employed workers regardless of whether or not their businesses are incorporated.

EST Media contact:                691-5902     Wednesday, January 21, 2004                              UNION MEMBERS IN 2003      In 2003, 12.9 percent of wage and salary workers were union members, down from 13.3 percent in 2002, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.  The number of persons belonging to a union fell by 369,000 over the year to 15.8 million in 2003.  The union membership rate has steadily declined from a high of 20.1 percent in 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available.  Some highlights from the 2003 data are:        --Men were more likely to be union members than women.        --Blacks were more likely to be union members than were whites, Asians,      and Hispanics or Latinos.        --Nearly 4 in 10 government workers were union members in 2003, compared      with less than 1 in 10 workers in private-sector industries.        --Nearly two-fifths of workers in education, training, and library      occupations and in protective service occupations were union members       in 2003.  Protective service occupations include fire fighters and       police officers.     Membership by Industry and Occupation        In 2003, workers in the public sector had a union membership rate more than four times that of private-sector employees, 37.2 percent compared with 8.2 percent.  The unionization rate for government workers has held steady since 1983.  The rate for private industry workers has fallen by about half over the same time period.  Within government, local government workers had the highest union membership rate, 42.6 percent.  This group includes the heavily unionized occupations of teachers, police officers, and fire fighters.  Among major private industries, transportation and utilities had the highest union membership rate, at 26.2 percent.  Con- struction (16.0 percent), information industries (13.6 percent), and manu- facturing (13.5 percent) also had higher-than-average rates.  Agriculture  and related industries had the lowest unionization rate in 2003--1.6 percent.   (See table 3.)        Among occupational groups, education, training, and library occupations (37.7 percent) and protective service workers (36.1 percent) had the highest  unionization rates in 2003.  Natural resources, construction, and maintenance  workers and production, transportation, and material moving occupations also  had higher-than-average union membership rates at 19.2 percent and 18.7 per- cent, respectively.  Among the major occupational groups, sales and office  occupations had the lowest unionization rate--8.2 percent.  (See table 3.)  Demographic Characteristics of Union Members        In 2003, union membership rates were higher for men (14.3 percent) than for women (11.4 percent).  The gap between men's and women's rates has narrowed considerably since 1983, when the rate for men was 10 percentage points higher than the rate for women.                                                                      - 2 -        Blacks were more likely to be union members (16.5 percent) than were whites (12.5 percent), Asians (11.4 percent), or Hispanics (10.7 percent). Union membership rates were highest among workers 45 to 54 years old.   Full-time workers were more than twice as likely as part-time workers to  be union members.  (See table 1.)     Union Representation of Nonmembers        About 1.7 million wage and salary workers were represented by a union on their main job in 2003, while not being union members themselves.  (See table 1.)  About half of these workers were employed in government.  (See table 3.)     Earnings        In 2003, full-time wage and salary workers who were union members had median usual weekly earnings of $760, compared with a median of $599 for wage and salary workers who were not represented by unions.  (See table 2.) The difference reflects a variety of influences in addition to coverage by a collective bargaining agreement, including variations in the distributions  of union members and nonunion employees by occupation, industry, firm size,  or geographic region.  (For a discussion of the problem of differentiating  between the influence of unionization status and the influence of other work- er characteristics on employee earnings, see ""Measuring union-nonunion earn- ings differences,"" Monthly Labor Review, June 1990.)     Union Membership by State        In 2003, 33 states reported lower union membership rates, while 15 states  and the District of Columbia registered increased rates.  Two states report- ed no change in their union membership rates from 2002 to 2003.  Twenty-nine  states had union membership rates below that of the U.S., while 21 states and  the District of Columbia had higher rates.  All states in the Middle Atlantic  and Pacific divisions again had union membership rates above the national av- erage of 12.9 percent, while all states in the East South Central and West  South Central divisions continued to have rates below it.  (See table 5.)        Four states had union membership rates over 20 percent in 2003--New York (24.6 percent), Hawaii (23.8 percent), Alaska (22.3 percent), and Michigan (21.9 percent).  This is the same rank order as in both 2001 and 2002.  All four states have had rates above 20 percent every year since data became regularly available in 1995.  North Carolina and South Carolina continued to report the lowest union membership rates, 3.1 and 4.2 percent, respectively.  These two states have had the lowest union membership rates each year since the state series became available.        The largest numbers of union members lived in California (2.4 million), New York (1.9 million), and Illinois (1.0 million).  About half (7.9 million)  of the 15.8 million union members in the U.S. lived in six states (California,  New York, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania), although these states  accounted for just over one-third of wage and salary employment nationally.        The number of union members in a state depends on both its union member- ship rate and the size of its employed workforce.  Texas had only about one- fourth as many union members as New York, despite having 1.2 million more  wage and salary employees.                      Union Members Technical Note         Table 1.

The median wage is the 50th percentile wage estimate--50 percent of workers earn less than the median and 50 percent of workers earn more than the median.   More about percentile wages.

GX271-89-1736031	"Report of the Executive Steering Committee for Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Policy on Adjustment for Non-Redistricting Uses  October 17, 2001   Recommendation The Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) recommended on March 1, 2001 that unadjusted census data be used for redistricting. After assessing considerable new evidence, ESCAP now recommends that unadjusted Census 2000 data also be used for nonredistricting purposes. The effect of this new evidence is that the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) overstated the net undercount by at least 3 million persons. The cause of this error was that the A.C.E. failed to measure a significant number of census erroneous enumerations, many of which were duplicates. This level of error in the A.C.E. measurement of net coverage is such that the A.C.E. results cannot be used in their current form. This finding of substantial error, in conjunction with remaining uncertainties, necessitates that revisions, based on additional review and analysis, be made to the A.C.E. estimates before any potential uses of these data can be considered. The Census Bureau will release the remaining Census 2000 data products, post-censal estimates, and survey controls using unadjusted data. It is, however, reasonable to expect that further research and analysis may lead to revised A.C.E. estimates that can be used to improve future post-censal estimates. The ESCAP review confirmed the finding in the first ESCAP Report that most Census 2000 and A.C.E. operations were of high quality. The evaluations continue to demonstrate that improvements were achieved over both the 1990 census and the 1990 coverage measurement survey. Important new information and methods are now available for assessing the A.C.E. and Census 2000. As will be discussed in more detail below, final analysis of this new information is still in progress. However, the Census Bureau believes that this analysis will confirm that Census 2000 made substantial gains in reducing the total net undercount, as well as reducing net differential undercount. Most of the A.C.E. operations were also seen to be well conducted, producing valuable information that, when combined with the other evaluation findings, provides important new research data. The ESCAP feels confident that its research program will enhance the evaluations of Census 2000, contribute to planning for the 2010 census, and, with further analysis, potentially improve future the post-censal estimates. The ESCAP's primary concern in its March decision was that fundamental differences between the Demographic Analysis (DA) estimates and the A.C.E. estimates could not be explained. The estimates differed widely, both for the total national population and for important population groups. The Committee investigated this inconsistency extensively but could not adequately explain it in the time available for the March decision. The Committee concluded in March that the inconsistency must have resulted from one or more of three possible scenarios. The first scenario was that all available 1990 census data, including the census results, the coverage measurement survey, and the demographic analysis estimates, significantly understated the Nation's population, but that Census 2000 found this previously un-enumerated population. The second scenario was that demographic analysis underestimated population growth between 1990 and 2000. The third scenario was that the A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's population, raising the possibility of an undiscovered problem in the A.C.E. or census methodology. The Census Bureau's extensive research over the past eight months has been directed at examining demographic analysis, the A.C.E., and Census 2000. Demographic analysis research examined historic levels of the components of population change to address the possibility that 1   the 1990 demographic analysis estimates understated the national population (the first scenario). This analysis did not reveal any significant problems. The Census Bureau investigated the second scenario by revising the preliminary estimates of international migration, and hence the foreign-born population, using actual Census 2000 long form data. The Census Bureau also consulted with outside experts on this work. These studies resulted in revisions to the ""Base DA"" that was initially examined as part of the March 2001 decision. The revisions reflected a larger growth in the foreign-born population during the last decade. The current revised demographic analysis estimates are much closer to the Alternative DA considered during the March deliberations. The A.C.E. and demographic analysis evaluations, when analyzed together, explain many of the inconsistencies. With regard to the third scenario, the ESCAP's review of the accuracy of the A.C.E. and Census 2000 was based on a number of evaluation studies, including reinterview studies, re-processing studies, and computer searches for duplicate enumerations. This research found that the A.C.E. did not account for a large number of Census 2000 duplicates, leading to an overstatement of the Census 2000 net undercount. As described previously, this finding, in conjunction with the revisions to demographic analysis, explains to a large degree the discrepancies between the A.C.E. and demographic analysis. The significance of the error in the A.C.E. treatment of duplicates compels the recommendation that the current A.C.E. estimates cannot be used to adjust the Census 2000 data. The ESCAP notes that its extensive evaluation program has provided information that was unavailable for previous decennial censuses. This important new information was the result of outstanding and innovative work on the part of many Census Bureau employees. Additionally, the Committee notes that some of the information resulted from new methodologies not available in prior censuses. Census 2000 was the first census to capture name information in a way that permits nationwide computer matching. The evaluation results, including the new tool of name matching, will be extremely valuable for evaluating the accuracy of Census 2000, planning for the 2010 census, and potentially for improving future post-censal estimates. Both census taking and coverage measurement are processes that evolve and improve with each census. The Census 2000 experience will help refine both census and coverage measurement processes for future censuses. While the ESCAP has recommended against use of the adjusted data, the A.C.E.'s original objective of addressing the differential undercount must still be pursued. The totality of the evidence considered by the Committee leads it to believe that while Census 2000 successfully lowered the historical pattern of the differential undercount, it did not eliminate it. The Census Bureau believes that the net undercount remains disproportionately distributed among renters and minority populations. With further research, it is reasonable to expect that new information can be used to produce revised A.C.E. estimates. These revised estimates may then be employed to improve post-censal population estimates by reducing remaining differential coverage error. It is also expected that planning for the 2010 census will greatly benefit from these findings, with improved operations to identify and remove duplicates and refined methods to improve the accuracy of all census operations. The Census Bureau will continue research to design improved operations, including coverage measurement studies, for future censuses and surveys.  2   Executive Summary After assessing considerable new evidence, the second ESCAP Committee (ESCAP II) has recommended that unadjusted Census 2000 data also be used for non-redistricting purposes. New evidence indicates that the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) overstated the net undercount by at least 3 million persons, and that the cause of this error was the A.C.E.'s failure to measure a significant number of census erroneous enumerations, many of which were duplicates. This level of error in the A.C.E. measurement of net coverage is such that the A.C.E. results cannot be used in their current form. This finding of substantial error, in conjunction with remaining uncertainties, necessitates that revisions, based on additional review and analysis, be made to the A.C.E. estimates before any potential uses of these data can be considered. The Census Bureau will release the remaining Census 2000 data products, post-censal estimates, and survey controls using unadjusted data. It is, however, reasonable to expect that further research and analysis may lead to revised A.C.E. estimates that can be used to improve future post-censal estimates. ESCAP II has also confirmed the finding in the first ESCAP Report that most Census 2000 and A.C.E. operations were of high quality. More recent evaluations continue to demonstrate that improvements were achieved over both the 1990 census and the 1990 coverage measurement survey. Important new information and methods are now available for assessing the A.C.E. and Census 2000. As will be discussed in more detail below, final analysis of the effects of this new information is still in progress. However, the Census Bureau believes that this analysis will confirm that Census 2000 made substantial gains in reducing the total net undercount, as well as the net differential undercount. Most of the A.C.E. operations were also seen to be well conducted, producing valuable information that, when combined with the other evaluation findings, provides important new research data. The ESCAP feels confident that the Census Bureau's continuing research program will enhance the evaluations of Census 2000, contribute to planning for the 2010 census, and, with further analysis, potentially improve the post-censal estimates. The ESCAP's primary concern in its March decision was that demographic analysis and the A.C.E. estimates differed widely, both for the total national population and for important population groups. The Committee concluded in March that the inconsistency must have derived from one or more of three possible scenarios. The first scenario was that all available 1990 census data, including the 1990 census, the 1990 coverage measurement survey, and the 1990 demographic analysis estimates significantly understated the Nation's population, while Census 2000 included portions of this previously un-enumerated population. The second scenario was that demographic analysis estimates underestimated population growth between 1990 and 2000. The third scenario was that the A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's population, raising the possibility of an undiscovered problem with the A.C.E. or census methodology. The ESCAP also identified additional technical concerns that are documented in the previous report.  Areas of Research In the months since the ESCAP I Report, the Committee embarked on a second round of deliberations to address the concerns identified in the report and to enable the Census Bureau to i   recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for future uses. The future uses in consideration included the post-censal population estimates, demographic survey controls, and the production of Census 2000 long form data products. The ESCAP I Committee did not have current results for certain measures of A.C.E. accuracy, and was forced to use 1990 data on potential A.C.E. errors. The ESCAP therefore directed and documented that a number of evaluations be conducted to inform the deliberations. Some of the evaluations were designed to provide current measures of accuracy for the various components of error. These evaluations involved additional technical research, field work, and data processing, as well as new computer matching and simulation research. The evaluations include:  Demographic Analysis (DA) Research The DA research program examined historical levels of the components of population change to address the possibility that the 1990 DA estimates understated the Nation's population and that demographic analysis did not capture the full population growth in the last decade. The Census Bureau consulted with outside demographic experts to plan and conduct its research program, focusing on the methodologies and underlying estimates of the components of population change. The research activities concentrated on two major areas  international migration and the robustness of the DA estimates.  Measurement of Erroneous Enumerations, Including Duplication Erroneous enumerations refer to individuals who should not be included in the census counts because they are duplicated, fictitious, or live someplace other than where they were enumerated. While the ESCAP I Report did not identify erroneous enumerations as an area of concern, Census Bureau researchers quickly noted that Census 2000 erroneous enumerations differed substantially from 1990 measures in ways that were not readily understood. Studies included the Measurement Error Reinterview/ Evaluation Followup (hereinafter called the EFU) and the Person Duplication Studies. EFU results were used to determine how well the A.C.E identified erroneous enumerations. The EFU was based on a reinterview of a sample drawn from the A.C.E. clusters. The Person Duplication Studies used computer matching techniques to identify Census 2000 duplicate enumerations throughout the United States, and to determine whether the A.C.E. estimates had correctly accounted for these duplications. These studies used computer matching methods not available in earlier censuses.  Measurement of Census Omissions Census omissions refer to individuals who should have been counted in the census but were not. The A.C.E. methodology must accurately account for both erroneous enumerations, as described above, and census omissions. The A.C.E. identifies omissions by matching an independent sample to the census. The accuracy of this measurement of omissions thus depends on the accuracy of the matching, as well as the accuracy of the information collected by the independent sample. Census omissions were evaluated in the Matching Error Study, in which expert matchers re-matched a sample of the A.C.E. to determine the accuracy of the A.C.E. matching process. Omissions were also evaluated in the EFU described above to measure the accuracy of the A.C.E. information on Census Day residence, including whether persons had moved since Census Day. ii   Missing Data Studies Missing data occurs in the A.C.E. if, after all attempts, there remain persons for whom complete data are not available, including demographic characteristics such as age or race. Missing data also includes the status of whether a person matched, was a resident on Census Day, or was correctly enumerated. The latter types of missing data can seriously affect the accuracy of coverage measurement surveys such as the A.C.E. The A.C.E. used a statistical model to account for the effects of missing data. The ESCAP directed the development of alternative missing data models to assess the effect on the estimates of using different assumptions to predict the effects of missing data.  Balancing Error The previous ESCAP report indicated concerns with balancing error. Balancing error occurs when the method used to determine the number of omissions is different from the method used to determine which records are correctly included in the census. The specific concern was that the area for matching to find omissions was different from the area used to determine erroneous enumerations. The ESCAP posited various scenarios that could explain the concerns with balancing error, ranging from small to very serious effects on the A.C.E. estimates. In order to investigate these concerns, additional field operations were conducted.  Synthetic Error Study The A.C.E. estimation methodology produced estimated coverage correction factors which were carried down within the post-strata in a process referred to as synthetic estimation. The key assumption underlying synthetic estimation is that net census coverage is relatively uniform within the post-strata. Failure of this assumption leads to synthetic error. The Census Bureau is concerned with synthetic error since it may affect the accuracy of small area estimates and cannot be directly estimated. ESCAP I examined the effects of synthetic error by studying ""artificial populations,"" populations created with surrogate variables that are known for the entire population, and are developed to reflect the distribution of net coverage error. ESCAP II directed the preparation of additional artificial populations.  Evaluation Results Demographic analysis research examined historical levels of the components of population change to address the possibility that the 1990 demographic analysis estimates understated the national population (the first scenario). This analysis did not reveal any significant problems. The Census Bureau investigated the second scenario by revising the estimates of international migration using preliminary Census 2000 long form data, and estimates of the numbers of births, using more current assumptions about birth registration. The Census Bureau also consulted with outside experts on this work. This analysis resulted in revisions to the Base DA that was initially examined as part of the ESCAP I decision. The revisions reflected a larger growth in the foreign-born population during the last decade. The current Revised DA estimates considered by ESCAP II are much closer to the Alternative DA considered during the ESCAP I deliberations. Many of the inconsistencies previously noted are removed when the Revised DA estimates are iii   viewed in light of the A.C.E. evaluations. The Revised DA national estimate of 281.8 million for the U.S. resident population is 2.2 million higher than the Base DA and about 0.6 million lower than the Alternative DA. The Revised DA net undercount rate of 0.12 percent compares to a net overcount of 0.65 percent implied by the Base DA, and a net undercount of 0.32 percent using the Alternative DA.  Erroneous Enumerations The studies examining the accuracy of the measurement of erroneous enumerations initially found serious errors that would have resulted in a large overstatement of the population by the A.C.E. The seriousness of these findings prompted the Committee to direct further work to make sure that the findings were correct. This additional review indicated that a significant problem existed with the measurement of erroneous enumerations, but also indicated that the study findings were subject to uncertainties resulting from a large number of cases left unresolved or conflicting. The Person Duplication Studies added additional information underscoring the seriousness of the errors in measuring erroneous enumerations. These duplication studies found that the A.C.E. had seriously understated the level of erroneous enumerations because of incompletely measuring census duplications, and that the EFU had not accounted for a significant part of this understatement. They also helped to explain some of the uncertainty that arose from the rework of the EFU. The net effect of these studies was the conclusion that the A.C.E. overstated the level of undercount by at least 3 million persons. The level of this error is such that the ESCAP determined that the unadjusted data should be used.  Census Omissions With regard to studies of census omissions, the Matching Error Study indicated that the A.C.E. overstated the net undercount due to P-sample matching error by about 385,000. The EFU indicated that a substantial number of movers were changed to nonmovers and vice versa. The net effect of these mover status changes suggests an overestimate of the match rate and therefore an understatement in the A.C.E. estimates of about 450,000. At the national level there is therefore a small net effect of about 65,000 on the accuracy of the measurement of census omissions. However, more research must be conducted to further study these effects.  Missing Data The Committee examined a variety of alternative models to account for the effects of missing data. These models gave a wide range of results, implying widely varying effects on the A.C.E. estimates. The data examined by the Committee make clear that alternative missing data models both understated and overstated the effects of missing data on the A.C.E. estimates, depending on the choice of model. The Committee ultimately viewed the choice of model as an increase in the uncertainty associated with the A.C.E. results, but did not find evidence of bias resulting from this choice of model. This uncertainty should be considered in further analysis of the A.C.E. estimates.  iv   Balancing Error ESCAP I's concern with balancing error has for the most part been resolved, as further research indicated that the previously observed discrepancy did not appreciably influence the A.C.E. estimates.  Total Error Model ESCAP I used a total error model to consolidate its research and to produce an overall assessment of A.C.E. accuracy. ESCAP II directed that an updated model be prepared to account for information from the new evaluation studies. The timing of some of the new evaluations, along with the complexities of both the studies and the A.C.E. design, did not allow preparation of an updated model that would incorporate all errors that impact the A.C.E. estimates. As discussed more fully in the body of the report, the ESCAP could not develop or verify a new total error model that would take into account all of the errors discovered in the EFU, Matching Error Study, and Person Duplication Studies. Even without the information from an updated total error model, however, it was clear to the Committee that the magnitude of the discovered errors precluded a recommendation in favor of the adjusted data.  Synthetic Error Consideration of the synthetic error studies requires the completion of the total error model and will be included in the continued research.  Other Concerns Additional studies allayed other concerns about the A.C.E. and the census. Studies revealed no evidence of significant contamination bias. The Committee concluded that the effect of excluding reinstated census people from the A.C.E. was minimal. The Committee further concluded that the kind, level and pattern of whole person imputation in Census 2000 did not call the A.C.E. results into question.  Next Steps While the ESCAP has recommended against use of the adjusted data, the A.C.E.'s original objective of addressing the differential undercount must still be pursued. The totality of the evidence considered by the Committee leads it to believe that while Census 2000 successfully lowered the historical pattern of the differential undercount, it did not eliminate it. The net undercount remains disproportionately distributed among renters and minority populations. With further research, it is reasonable to expect that new information can be used to produce revised A.C.E. estimates. The evaluation results, including the new measurement tool of name matching, will be extremely valuable for evaluating the accuracy of Census 2000, planning for the 2010 census, and potentially for improving the post-censal estimates. Both census taking and coverage measurement are processes that evolve and improve with each census. The Census 2000 experience will help refine both census and coverage measurement processes for future censuses. v   Table of Contents Executive Summary .................................................... i Areas of Research .................................................... . i Evaluation Results .................................................... iii Next Steps .............................................................v ...................................................... vi .......................................................1  Table of Contents ESCAP II Report Introduction  ...............................................................1 Background ..............................................................1 ESCAP II Proceedings ....................................................1 Non-redistricting uses of the data ..........................................2 .......................................................4 Demographic Analysis ....................................................4 International Migration ................................................... 4 Measurement of Vital Events ..............................................5 Results of Revised DA ....................................................6 Research to Evaluate the A.C.E. and Census 2000 ..........................8 Matching Error Study ...... ..............................................9 Evaluation Followup .....................................................9 Person Duplication Studies ................................................9 Measurement of Erroneous Enumerations, Including Duplicates ............10 Measurement of Census Omissions ....................................... 11 Correlation Bias .........................................................12 A.C.E.

This recommendation was in accord with the recommendation of the Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP). The ESCAP1 was unable to conclude, based on information available at the time, that adjusted Census 2000 data were more accurate for redistricting. The ESCAP I Report is available on the Census Bureau's website, along with a voluminous Administrative Record supporting this recommendation. The primary issue that precluded ESCAP I from recommending use of the adjusted data was the unexplained difference between the A.C.E. and Demographic Analysis estimates of the population. Demographic analysis (DA) initially estimated the national total population to be below the census count, while the A.C.E. estimated the population to be above the census count. This discrepancy raised the significant possibility of an undetected problem with the A.C.E. or the census. ESCAP I also identified concerns with balancing and synthetic estimation error as potential problems in the adjusted data. The Committee directed the preparation of an extensive evaluation program to inform its deliberations relating to the proposed use of adjusted data for nonredistricting purposes.  ESCAP II Proceedings In the months since the ESCAP I Report, the Committee has embarked on a second round of deliberations to address the concerns identified in the report and to enable the Census Bureau to recommend whether the adjusted Census 2000 data should be used for nonredistricting purposes. These evaluations, the ESCAP II report series, set forth the underlying data that support the Committee's findings. The future uses in consideration include post-censal population estimates, demographic survey controls, and the census long form data products. Some of the required evaluations involved additional research, including additional field work and matching work. ESCAP II considered a wide variety of research and analyses, and heard presentations of the reports on the attached list (Attachment 1). Some of these presentations provided background information to help the Committee interpret the results of other studies, while others bore directly on the adjustment recommendation. While the Committee considered and deliberated on all of the listed reports, this discussion will focus on those most directly relevant to the  For clarity, the Committee that produced the March 1, 2001, ESCAP Report is sometimes referred to herein as ""ESCAP I"" and the March 1 report as the ""ESCAP I Report."" The Committee that has been meeting since March 1, 2001, is referred to as ""ESCAP II."" Page 1 of 18  1   comparative accuracy of the adjusted and unadjusted data. This research was conducted over many months and represents diligent and thorough statistical and demographic analysis.2 The Associate Director for Decennial Census originally chartered the ESCAP on November 26, 1999, and charged the Committee to ""advise the Director in determining policy for the A.C.E. and the integration of the A.C.E. results into the census for all purposes except Congressional reapportionment."" Although there was a change in the Associate Director for the Decennial Census position in June 2001, ESCAP II continued to be chaired by John Thompson to maintain continuity. The ESCAP resumed meeting on March 7, 2001, and met a total of 32 times, sometimes with more than one meeting per day. The ESCAP represents a body of senior career Census Bureau professionals, with advanced degrees in relevant technical fields and/or decades of experience in the federal statistical system. All are highly competent to evaluate the relative merits of the A.C.E. data versus the census data and are recognized for their extensive contributions to the professional community. As in the ESCAP I process, the early sessions were primarily educational, designed to inform Committee members of the research operations and to present general information about nonredistricting uses of the data. The second phase involved presentation by knowledgeable employees of the new data and analyses as they became available. The Committee reviewed the data and analyses, sometimes asking staff to provide additional and new information. The third phase was deliberation, where the Committee members met privately. The final and briefest stage was review, where Committee members commented on the draft report. Again, as in the ESCAP I process, minutes were prepared for all sessions, except for the final ones, which were private deliberations. During the education and evidence presentation phases, the Chair generally arranged presentations on major issues, issues that he identified on his own initiative or on the suggestion of Committee members. During the evidence presentation stage, authors of the analysis reports presented their data and conclusions to the Committee. The deliberation and review phases were less structured with various members raising topics for discussion and asking for evidence. No formal vote was held; this Report reflects a consensus of the ESCAP.  Non-redistricting uses of the data The ESCAP's recommendation covers the three non-redistricting uses of census data: postcensal estimates, demographic survey controls, and Census 2000 long form products. Certain Census Bureau data products have already been issued using only the unadjusted data, including the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Summary File, Demographic Profiles, Congressional District Demographic Profiles, Summary File 1 Data, and reports in the Census 2000 Brief Series.3 The ESCAP II Report Series does not represent the entirety of the Census Bureau's evaluation of Census 2000. The Census Bureau's formal Census 2000 Evaluation Program provides a comprehensive evaluation of all Census operations and programs. The reports in the ESCAP II series are only those necessary to inform the ESCAP's recommendation. 3 2  These models can be found at http://factfinder.census.gov. Page 2 of 18   Post-censal estimates are made by updating the most recent census base with estimates of population change (births, deaths, and net migration). As directed by the Census Act, the Census Bureau prepares post-censal estimates at the national, state, and county level every year, and at the functioning governmental unit level every other year.4 These estimates have a variety of uses, most notably in funding allocations, as the basis for sample survey controls, and as denominators for many important statistics. The accuracy of the post-censal estimates for funding allocations is critical, as about $200 billion are allocated based on these data each year. Medicaid (Title XIX) is the largest program to distribute federal funding based on population estimates, distributing over $100 billion each year based on the post-censal estimates. Community Development Block Grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Title I Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants from the Department of Education are two additional federal programs that use postcensal estimates as factors in their funding formulas to distribute federal monies. The individual states also have within-state fund allocation programs, many of which use post-censal estimates to allocate funds to sub-state areas. Many federal agencies use post-censal estimates as denominators to produce per capita statistics. Examples are per capita income, crime statistics, incidence of certain health conditions, birth rates, and mortality rates. The numerators of these statistics can be obtained at various points in time throughout the decade. In the absence of updated information, calculating these kinds of statistics on a static 2000 denominator would be misleading; therefore, many federal agencies use post-censal estimates of population. Demographic survey controls are used by many national sample surveys to transform the data they collect into nationally representative estimates. The most notable is the Current Population Survey, or CPS, which is used to calculate the monthly unemployment rate. Sample surveys generally have poorer coverage than a census; therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of estimates from a sample survey, the survey estimates are controlled to independent measures of the number of people in certain age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin groups, such as the post-censal estimates. The ESCAP Committee also considered whether adjusted or unadjusted Census 2000 data should be used for the controls for estimates based on data from the Census 2000 long form. The long form collects more extensive characteristic data from a sample of about seventeen percent of the population. Long form data are used to provide local communities with data on education, employment, housing, and various other social and demographic characteristics essential to efficient planning. Additionally, the long form provides the detailed local demographic and social characteristics used in some federal formula allocation programs. In order to produce estimates for the country as a whole from this sample, Census 2000 data from the short form items are used as controls.  4  13 U.S.C.  181. Page 3 of 18   ESCAP II Research In the months since the ESCAP I Report, the Committee embarked on a second round of deliberations to address the concerns identified in the report and to enable the Census Bureau to recommend whether adjusted Census 2000 data should be applied for non-redistricting uses. ESCAP II, therefore, directed the preparation of a number of evaluation studies, as described in detail in Attachment 2. Research centered around four areas, demographic analysis, the A.C.E., Census 2000, and synthetic error. The results of this research are set forth below.  Demographic Analysis ESCAP I's primary concern was that DA estimates were inconsistent with A.C.E. estimates. The Census Bureau expected, based on past experience, that demographic analysis would posit a higher estimate of the total population than the A.C.E. because of the presence of correlation bias, and that the two estimates would agree generally on the coverage of certain populations. Instead, the Base DA estimates were lower than both the Census 2000 population counts and the A.C.E. estimates. In response, the Census Bureau developed its Alternative DA estimates by doubling the unauthorized immigration assumed to have occurred during the 1990's. Doing so yielded a number of foreign born for 2000 that was roughly consistent with that reported by the March 2000 Current Population Survey.5 The Alternative DA estimates were, however, still significantly lower than the A.C.E. estimates. The Alternative DA indicated that Census 2000 undercounted the population by 0.32 percent, while the A.C.E. produced a net undercount estimate of 1.15 percent.6 ESCAP I concluded that the inconsistency in the estimates of the total national population must have derived from one or more of three possible explanations. The first explanation was that all available 1990 census data, including the census results, the 1990 coverage measurement survey, and the 1990 DA estimates, significantly understated the Nation's population, but that Census 2000 found this previously un-enumerated population. The second explanation was that DA underestimated population growth between 1990 and 2000. The third explanation was that the A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's population. ESCAP II directed that further research on demographic analysis be conducted. It focused on two main topics: international migration and measurement of vital events like births and deaths. International Migration Assumptions regarding international migration were the most uncertain component in the demographic analysis estimates completed by March 1, 2001. Although the research agenda for  The March Current Population Survey was reweighted using the Census 2000 counts by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin for this comparison. This figure differs from the 1.18 percent usually quoted for the A.C.E. because the A.C.E. and DA estimate different populations. DA estimates the total population, while the A.C.E. estimates the household population, which excludes group quarters. Page 4 of 18 6  5   the March through October period focused primarily on those components of international migration that are less well measured (e.g., emigration, temporary migration, and unauthorized migration), the work also included research into legal immigration and the demographic characteristics of migrants used in the March 2001 DA estimates. Part of the analysis involved discussions with independent experts on demographic analysis and international migration. The purpose of a March 20, 2001, was to explain how the DA estimates differed from the A.C.E. estimates, and to discuss how to prioritize short-term and long-term research activities. Attendees included experts from the statistical community, academia, state agencies, the Census Bureau's advisory committees, professional organizations, and international organizations. A nearly unanimous recommendation from these experts was to focus on assumptions and estimates of the components of international migration, as these numbers were subject to the most uncertainty. Because of scheduling conflicts, two smaller meetings with other migration experts were held at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America on March 29-30, 2001. Expert advice was sought again, on September 24, 2001, after completion of the original research activities (validation of the 1990 estimates and updated 2000 estimates) that produced the revised DA estimates. Although these experts generally agreed with the methodology used to calculate components of international migration, they had concerns about the assumptions regarding the undercount of international migrants. Specifically, they believed the undercount assumption of 15 percent for unauthorized migrants, which was incorporated in the Revised DA, was probably too high, especially given the A.C.E. undercounts for other hard-to-enumerate groups. In addition, they urged renaming the residual migrant category as the residual foreignborn, or separating the residual foreign born into known components (""quasi-legal"" migrants) and the implied unauthorized migrant population. Both of these suggestions were incorporated into a subsequent sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis of assumptions about coverage of various components of the foreignborn population showed that the total number of foreign born did not vary enough to have much effect on the DA estimate of the total population. For example, the lower bound assumption of 3.3 percent net undercount of the foreign-born equated to a population of 281.3 million, or more than 3 million people lower than the A.C.E. total population. The upper bound assumption of 6.7 percent was consistent with a population of 282.5 million -- still more than 2 million lower than the A.C.E. total population. These results led the Census Bureau to conclude that the Revised DA was an appropriate benchmark for assessing Census 2000 and the A.C.E. estimates. Measurement of Vital Events Other research examined the remaining assumptions underlying the DA components of change, including the birth, death, and Medicare components. Although estimates of deaths and the size of the elderly population did not change much, the estimates of historical births changed because of this research. The principal outcome was a revision in the assumptions about registration completeness of births since 1968. The previous DA estimates assumed that all births in years since 1968 (the last year of testing birth registration completeness) were registered at the same percent (99.2 percent). For the Revised DA estimates, registration completeness gradually reached 100 percent by 1985 (the first year natality statistics were Page 5 of 18   reported electronically from all the States), and remained at 100 percent through 2000. This revision lowered the estimated number of births for 1968-2000 by 715,000 (which lowered the Revised DA estimate of the total population in 2000 by the same amount).7 Results of Revised DA The research undertaken between March and October allayed two fundamental concerns: first, the possibility that the Alternative DA did not capture the full growth of the population between 1990 and 2000, and second, the possibility that the 1990 DA was lower than the true population. In fact, the cumulative effect of the research on immigration, births, and deaths led to Revised DA estimates that were only slightly different from the Alternative DA. In other words, the inconsistency between the Alternative DA and the A.C.E. estimates was not the result of unexplained problems in DA. These results, in combination with other evidence, led the ESCAP to conclude that the A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's total population. More specifically, the Revised DA lowered the net undercount rates from 1.85 to 1.65 percent in 1990, and from 0.32 to 0.12 percent in 2000, but did not alter the DA finding that the net undercount rate in 2000 was substantially lower than in 1990.8 The Revised DA continued to measure a lower net undercount than the A.C.E., and in fact was very close to the Alternative DA estimate used by ESCAP I in March. The Revised DA estimated a net undercount of 0.3 million, or 0.12 percent, compared with the A.C.E. estimate of a net undercount of 3.3 million, or 1.15 percent. Population totals from the Base DA, Alternative DA, and Revised DA, along with the Census 2000 counts and the A.C.E. estimates, are shown in Table A. The corresponding numerical and percentage undercounts are shown in Figure 1.

Under the revised DA, the net undercount rate was reduced by 1.53 percentage points, from 1.65 percent in 1990 to 0.12 percent in 2000. In contrast, the A.C.E. estimate of 1.15 percent net undercount in 2000 was 0.43 percentage points lower than the 1.58 percent in 1990. Additionally, both DA and the A.C.E. measured a reduction in the net undercount rates of Black and nonBlack children compared with 1990. Both methods also measured a reduction in the net undercount rates of adult Black men and women. The revised DA and A.C.E. estimates continued to disagree in that DA found a reduction in the net undercount rates of nonBlack men and women in Census 2000 compared with the rates of previous censuses. The A.C.E. indicated no change or a slight increase in undercount rates for nonBlack adults as a group. Demographic analysis also provided evidence that correlation bias was not reduced between 1990 and 2000. Comparisons of the DA and A.C.E. sex ratios (men per 100 women) showed that correlation bias in the survey estimates was not reduced for Black men between 1990 and 2000. The A.C.E. sex ratios for Black adults were much lower than the expected sex ratios based on DA, implying that the A.C.E. did not capture the high undercount rate of Black men relative to Black women. The size of this bias was about the same as in the 1990 coverage measurement survey.

Research to Evaluate the A.C.E. and Census 2000 A number of the studies described more fully in Attachment 2 evaluate the accuracy of the A.C.E. and Census 2000. The A.C.E. is composed of two samples, the E-sample, which measures erroneous enumerations, and the P-sample, which measures census omissions. The E-sample is also used to estimate the number of census persons who do not have sufficient information to be used in A.C.E. matching and followup operations. The Dual System Estimates (DSEs) are computed by combining E-sample estimates of erroneous enumerations and insufficient information with P-sample estimates of omission. Therefore it is critical that the E-sample correctly account for erroneous enumerations and that the P-Sample correctly account for omissions. The evaluations were designed to measure the accuracy of both the P- and E-Samples. Three studies in particular produced substantial new information for ESCAP II: the Matching Error Study, the Evaluation Followup (EFU), and the Person Duplication Studies. Page 8 of 18   Matching Error Study  9  The Matching Error Study provided the P-sample matching error rate and the E-sample processing error rate. Expert matchers clerically rematched all of the people in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. clusters to determine the best match code. This information was compared to match codes assigned in production of the actual A.C.E. estimates. Evaluation Followup10 The EFU consisted of a reinterview of households in the same one-fifth subsample of A.C.E. clusters used in the Matching Error Study, with additional subsampling. EFU results helped determine the accuracy of the production data processed and collected in the P- and E-Samples. The EFU interview results were used to measure the accuracy of the classification of correct and erroneous census enumerations as determined by the E-Sample. The results were also used to measure the accuracy of the P-Sample data regarding mover status and Census Day residence. Person Duplication Studies 11  The Person Duplication Studies took advantage of the fact that Census 2000 was the first census to record name information in the data capture system in a way that permits computer matching. This new methodology permitted the Census Bureau to direct a nationwide computer matching operation to measure the level of duplication in the census. These studies also examined how well the A.C.E. accounted for these duplicates. While the A.C.E. matched respondents in the same block and surrounding blocks, this new tool permitted the Census Bureau to search for duplicates throughout the country. The Person Duplication Studies involved only computer matching, as the Census Bureau lacked the resources and time to match to the entire country using both computer and clerical matching. The computer matching thus understated the actual level of duplication. These studies also compared the results of the EFU with the Person Duplication Studies to determine whether the EFU correctly measured these duplications. Some of the error components produced in these studies suggest that the A.C.E. overestimated the net undercount while others suggest the net undercount was underestimated. 9  ESCAP II Report No. 7, ""Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Matching Error.""

Page 9 of 18 11  10   The results of these studies are discussed below, and are the basis for the recommendation that the adjusted data not be used due to a significant problem in the measurement of erroneous enumerations resulting in an overstatement of the net undercount by at least 3 million people.  Measurement of Erroneous Enumerations, Including Duplicates The evaluations of the accuracy of the A.C.E. indicated that the A.C.E. did not measure a significant portion of the Census 2000 erroneous enumerations. The measurement of erroneous enumerations is critical to both the national net undercount and to sub-national estimates. The effect of this error resulted in the A.C.E. significantly overstating the net Census 2000 undercount by at least 3 million people, with an approximate range of 3 to 4 million. The significance of this error was such that the ESCAP recommended that the unadjusted data be used for Census 2000 non-redistricting purposes. The EFU and the Person Duplication Studies described above provided the most significant information regarding the measurement of erroneous enumerations. The initial EFU results gave evidence of a significant understatement in the A.C.E. measurement of erroneous enumerations. Because of the significance of the understatement, the EFU was extensively reviewed. The revised EFU again also indicated a significant problem with understating the level of erroneous enumerations, and resulted in a high level of cases left unresolved or conflicting. The Person Duplication Studies found that a significant number of duplicate enumerations were not measured by the A.C.E., and that the EFU did not pick up significant portions of this error. The Person Duplication Studies also resolved a portion of the cases left unresolved or conflicting by the EFU Review. The EFU initially found a 3.5 percent change in enumeration status from that measured by A.C.E. production. A total of about 2,800,000 production ""correct enumerations"" (SE 223,000) were re-coded as ""erroneous enumerations,"" while about 900,000 production ""erroneous enumerations,"" (SE 99,000) were re-coded as ""correct enumerations.""12 The net difference found by the EFU was 1,900,000. The EFU also included about 4,500,000 cases (SE 353,000) that could not be resolved. This study indicted that, at a minimum, the A.C.E. overstated the level of net undercount by about 2 million people. Because of the EFU's potentially significant implications for the A.C.E. estimates, ESCAP decided that further EFU analysis was needed. Accordingly, more highly trained matching analysts from the National Processing Center (NPC) directly reviewed a subsample of the EFU and production cases. Matching analysts are employees at NPC with many years of training in matching, some with over 20 years of experience, who supervise and perform quality assurance for all the A.C.E. matching operations. This additional review confirmed that there were errors in the A.C.E.'s identification of erroneous enumerations. A total of about 1,800,000 enumerations (SE 189,000) that were coded as correct in production were subsequently coded erroneous in the evaluation, while the number 12  ESCAP II Report No. 3, ""Evaluation Results for Changes in A.C.E. Enumeration Page 10 of 18  Status.""   of enumerations coded as erroneous in production that were then coded as correct in the review was about 361,000 (SE 46,000).13 Consequently, the net difference in the ""correct enumeration"" to ""erroneous enumeration"" and ""erroneous enumeration"" to ""correct enumeration"" cells was estimated at 1,450,000, rather than the initial level of 1,900,000. However, the review identified over 15 million cases which could not be resolved or for which conflicting results were observed. Depending on assumptions that could be made regarding the enumeration status of these cases, the overstatement of the net undercount could range from about 1.45 million to up to 5.9 million people.14 The Person Duplication Studies found that a significant number of duplicate enumerations were not correctly measured by the A.C.E. or by the EFU. Furthermore, when the Person Duplication Studies results are combined with the EFU results, some of the unresolved and conflicting cases can be explained. Based on this work, more refined ranges for the level of the A.C.E. overstatement were developed. Direct estimates were produced from the Person Duplication Studies that indicated that the level of A.C.E. error not measured was about 3 million persons. In addition, it is also expected that further refinements to the treatment of the unresolved and conflicting cases would lead to about an additional 800,000 errors. Thus, the approximate range of the potential overstatement of the net undercount was reduced to between 3 and 4 million persons. Finally, the EFU provided information regarding whether the A.C.E. accurately measured Census 2000 discrepant enumerations.15 This study showed that the net effect of erroneously identifying discrepant persons as correct enumerations in production and vice versa is an overstatement of about 6,000 correct enumerations in production, with a standard error of about 30,000.16 This difference is statistically insignificant.  Measurement of Census Omissions Measurement of census omissions is based on the P-Sample. Therefore, accurate matching of the P-sample to the census, and the correct classification of mover status and Census Day residence, are important components of the P-Sample. Information about the accuracy of the  ESCAP II Report No. 24, ""Results of the Person Followup and Evaluation Followup Forms Review."" ESCAP II Report No. 24, ""Results of the Person Followup and Evaluation Followup Forms Review."" Discrepant results include falsification (the amount is uncertain), but do not include honest mistakes made by the interviewers or respondents. A person is classified as discrepant during the matching operation if three knowledgeable respondents indicate not knowing him or her in either the EFU or production interview. ESCAP II Report No. 4, ""A.C.E. Erroneous Enumerations Errors: Analysis of Census Discrepant Persons."" Page 11 of 18 16 15 14  13   matching was produced by the Matching Error Study. Information about the accuracy of the classification of movers and Census Day residence was derived from the EFU. The Matching Error Study indicated that the level of matching error from the P-Sample would result in about a 385,000 overstatement of the net undercount.17 The EFU demonstrated that misclassification of movers in the A.C.E. may have resulted in an understatement of about 450,000 in the net undercount.18 It should be noted that this final effect was the result of significant changes in mover status. These changes involved a large number of movers becoming nonmovers and vice versa. The EFU indicated that about 4.5 million people classified as ""movers"" in production became ""nonmovers,"" and that about 2.4 million people classified as ""nonmovers"" in production became ""movers."" At the national level there is therefore a small net effect of about 65,000 on the accuracy of the measurement of census omissions. However, more research must be conducted to further study these effects. The ESCAP was concerned about the EFU measurement of movers who became nonmovers, specifically about whether the EFU measured too few movers, due to its questionnaire design. To be classified a nonmover, the EFU required less detailed information than needed to be classified a mover. An examination of the bias caused by mover status changes indicates that the effect of mover-to-nonmover changes was greater in absolute value then the effect of nonmoverto-mover changes. Therefore, if there was an over reporting of nonmovers in the EFU, the effect would be to lower the measured net bias described above. Additional work must clearly be conducted to clarify this information. Furthermore, even though the net effects of these errors cancel at the national level, assessment of the subnational effects also requires further research.  Correlation Bias Correlation bias refers to the tendency for people enumerated in the census to be more likely to be included in the A.C.E. than those missed in the census. Correlation bias usually results in a downward bias in the DSE. This type of bias can result from causal dependence, that is, the tendency of some people to be more likely to be included in the A.C.E. because they had been included in the census, or vice versa, or from heterogeneity. Heterogeneity bias can arise because different people within poststrata both have different chances of being counted in the census and different chances of being included in the A.C.E. To cause a bias, these chances must be correlated, for example, those likely to be missed by the census are also most likely to be missed by the A.C.E. ESCAP I assessed possible correlation bias in the A.C.E. estimates by comparing the A.C.E. and DA results. Correlation bias estimates available for the March ESCAP recommendation used DA estimates as of February 26, 2001. ESCAP II directed that the correlation bias estimates be recomputed to use the Revised DA estimates and other newly available data. Revised correlation bias estimates were computed and discussed by the Committee. 17  ESCAP II Report No. 7, ""Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Matching Error.""  ESCAP II Report No. 16, ""Evaluation Results for changes in Mover and Residence Status in the A.C.E."" Page 12 of 18  18   Like ESCAP I, ESCAP II was faced with the fact that while correlation bias exists, it is difficult to quantify. Correlation bias is an important component of assessing the A.C.E.'s accuracy because assumptions regarding correlation bias have a large effect. ESCAP II considered several models of correlation bias, including whether correlation bias should be assumed only for the Black population, whether the Hispanic population should be assumed to have the same degree of correlation bias as the Black population, and whether correlation bias should be assumed to be the same for owners and renters. Correlation bias would mean that the A.C.E. estimates of total population were too low by about 750,000 to 1.3 million, depending on which model for correlation bias is assumed.19 Currently the Census Bureau has no means of incorporating these net biases in the production DSEs.  A.C.E. Missing Data Missing data occurs in the A.C.E. if, after all followup attempts, there remain households that were not interviewed, or households with some portions of the person data missing, such as age or race. Sometimes the missing item involves the status of whether a person matched, was a resident on Census Day, or was correctly enumerated. Statistical models are used to account for missing data. ESCAP I viewed the rates of occurrence of unresolved A.C.E. cases for match status, correct enumeration status, and mover status as low enough to preclude serious biases in the A.C.E. results. ESCAP II directed development of additional missing data models to assess the effect on the estimates of using alternative models. The treatment of missing data can have a large effect on the A.C.E. estimates under certain assumptions. ESCAP II examined a variety of models to predict the effects of missing data. Seven basic methods for addressing the components of missing data in the A.C.E. estimates were considered in various combinations. Each resulting alternative model was used to compute new DSE. The alternatives considered indicated that the choice of missing data model can have a significant effect on the resulting estimates of coverage error, causing the DSEs to be over- or under-stated. The Census Bureau chose to represent the effects of these alternative models in the form of increased uncertainty in the A.C.E. estimates. The DSEs that resulted from the alternative models were used to calculate a measure of variation similar to a sampling error. This research found that non-sampling variability from the use of alternative missing data models was considerable. At the national level, the overall magnitude of the variation resulting from all combinations of the alternative missing data models (about 530,000) was higher than the DSE sampling error (about 380,000).20 When some alternative models were excluded, the standard deviation was of approximately the same magnitude as the DSE sampling error, but there is no evidence to suggest that the measure of variation based on all methods is unreasonable. In fact, arguments could be made that this measure understates the actual levels of variation due to missing data because it assumes that the  ESCAP II Report No. 10, ""Estimation of Correlation Bias in 2000 A.C.E. Estimates Using Revised Demographic Analysis Results."" 20  19  ESCAP II Report No. 12, ""Analysis of Missing Data Alternatives."" Page 13 of 18   alternatives considered were randomly distributed around an average, that is, each alternative was equally likely. ESCAP II also examined information describing the level and distribution of A.C.E. missing data compared to the 1990 coverage measurement survey. The purpose of this review was to put the levels of missing data in context with 1990, and to add to the understanding of the alternative missing data model analysis previously described. The 2000 unresolved rates were slightly higher than those in 1990, but were not initially viewed as high enough to cause major concern. The alternative model analysis indicated that missing data had a more significant effect than anticipated, possibly due to changes in the methods for incorporating movers into the DSE, or to a more diverse set of alternative models.  Balancing Error The ESCAP I Report had identified balancing error as a potential problem, noting that the A.C.E. found 3 million more matches in surrounding blocks than correct enumerations, a result which could have affected the accuracy of the estimates. The A.C.E. matching is carried out in a defined search area consisting of the A.C.E. sample blocks (clusters) and a targeted area of blocks surrounding or bordering the A.C.E blocks. Significant differences were discovered between the number of matches and correct enumerations found in the surrounding blocks. Various scenarios were identified that could explain the difference, and ESCAP II directed that evaluations be conducted to investigate the source of this difference, identify the scale of any error, and assess whether its magnitude could significantly affect the accuracy of the adjusted data. This analysis necessitated additional field work. The evaluations indicated that the causes of the discrepancies were for the most part related to a scenario that does not significantly affect the resulting DSEs. That is, most of the 3 million difference was attributable to the A.C.E. listing housing units in the blocks surrounding the sample blocks, which had little, if any, effect on the DSE. The evaluations did, however, detect about 246,000 A.C.E people (SE 82,000) located out of the surrounding blocks.21 The evaluations also estimated that an additional 195,000 people (SE 56,000) were incorrectly identified as having been correctly enumerated, but although they were found to have been out of the search area. The effect of these errors is an approximate overstatement of the net undercount by about 450,000 persons. It appeared that a portion of these errors were also included in the results of the EFU and Matching Error Study. While some additional work is required to completely resolve the potential effects of balancing error, the ESCAP believes that most of the previous concerns regarding balancing error have been addressed.  Conditioning Conditioning, or contamination bias, refers to the situation where the A.C.E. influenced the census. ESCAP I assumed in its deliberations that any effects of conditioning or contamination bias were minimal, and could be ignored. This assumption was based on previous experiences in ESCAP II Report No. 2, ""Evaluation of Lack of Balance and Geographic Errors Affecting Person Estimates."" Page 14 of 18 21   the 1990 census. Evidence presented to ESCAP II confirmed that contamination bias was not a problem in Census 2000, as research did not identify any evidence of its presence.22  Reinstated Late Additions While ESCAP I did not identify Census 2000 late additions as a source of error, levels of these additions were significantly higher than in the 1990 census. Late additions refers to persons included in the final census count who were excluded from A.C.E. matching and dual system estimation because of their late inclusion. For Census 2000, the late additions consisted exclusively of housing units that were temporarily removed from the census because they were suspected to duplicate other housing units, but which were later (after the A.C.E. matching process started) reinstated into the final census after further research. ESCAP I determined that if the reinstated people were a small percentage of the correct enumerations in the census, or if their A.C.E. coverage rate was similar to the A.C.E. coverage rate for census people included in A.C.E., then there would be a minimal effect on the DSEs.23 To validate this assumption, additional research was conducted. Based on this additional work, ESCAP II concluded that the effect of excluding reinstated census people from the A.C.E. was minimal. The A.C.E. coverage rate may have been overestimated by 0.034 to 0.082 percentage points.24 This result confirmed the assumption, previously made in the ESCAP I Report, that the effect of the reinstated people on the DSEs would be small.  Census 2000 Imputations Census 2000 experienced a higher rate of whole person imputations than in the 1990 census. Whole person imputations were excluded from A.C.E. matching activities, but reflected in the census coverage error as measured by the A.C.E. ESCAP I was concerned that information was not available at the time to validate that the whole person imputations were explainable by Census 2000 design features (and thus should have no discernible impact on the A.C.E.). ESCAP II concluded that the kind, level, and pattern of whole person imputations in Census 2000 raised no additional issues relative to the accuracy of the A.C.E. adjustment. Approximately 5.77 million persons had all their characteristics (short form data items) imputed in Census 2000, compared to 1.97 million persons in the 1990 census. Approximately 1.2 million of these persons were added to the census count through a count imputation process. The remaining 4.6 million persons were counted directly through the census enumeration ESCAP II Report No. 14, ""Conditioning of Census 2000 Data Collected in Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Block Clusters.""

Page 15 of 18   process, but had all their person characteristics imputed because information about them was substantially missing from the census records.25 Research into the sources of the whole person imputations identified that changes in the census design contributed to the level of housing units requiring imputation. Furthermore, the count imputation rate was comparable to the rate experienced in the 1970 and 1980 censuses. Characteristics of the imputed persons were also examined. The age, race and sex characteristics of the population requiring some form of imputation was similar to the datadefined population with the exception of the age category under 18. The relatively higher percent of the population under age 18 in the imputed population was due to the high proportion of younger people in the ""within household"" category and reflected the fact that large households (greater than 6) were likely to have children not able to be accommodated by the 6-person mailreturn form, and thus require imputation.26  Total Error Model and Loss Function Analysis The total error model is designed to incorporate the results of the evaluations to produce a composite estimate of the bias and variability (both sampling and non-sampling) in the A.C.E. These measures are used to correct the A.C.E., thus producing measures of the ""true"" population that can be used to assess the accuracy of the adjusted and unadjusted census data. The total error model produces measures of this ""true"" population in the form of target populations which are based on various assumptions because the truth is not known.27 The total error model used by ESCAP I relied in part on 1990 data, as complete Census 2000 evaluations of the A.C.E were not then available. This preliminary model adapted the 1990 total error model to the Census 2000 environment. For the current deliberations, the ESCAP II wanted to base recommendations on current data. Therefore, development of a new total error model was undertaken to incorporate the results of the Census 2000 evaluations. The complexities of the revised EFU study and the A.C.E. design did not allow for the development and validation of a new total error model. Therefore, the ESCAP has had to rely on the individual evaluations described above. It is also apparent that a significant amount of additional research and development will be necessary before a complete total error model is available. ESCAP II believes that the information currently available is strong enough to preclude the use of adjusted data for any further Census 2000 purposes, but that future research may lead to improved A.C.E. estimates, that could, in turn, be used to improve the post-censal estimates.  25  ESCAP II Report No. 21, ""Analysis of Census Imputations.""

Page 16 of 18  27   Synthetic Estimation The A.C.E. estimation methodology produces estimated coverage correction factors for each post-stratum. These factors were carried down within the post-strata in a process referred to as synthetic estimation. The key assumption underlying synthetic estimation is that net census coverage is relatively uniform within the post-strata. Failure of this assumption leads to synthetic error. Synthetic error affects both the adjusted and unadjusted census results. ESCAP I analyzed the effects of synthetic error by using artificial populations, which are populations created with surrogate variables to reflect the distribution of net coverage error. Additional synthetic estimation analysis for ESCAP II focused on expanding the scope of the earlier artificial population work. ESCAP II continues to be concerned with synthetic error because it is not included directly in the total error model. However, as the synthetic error analysis must be considered in conjunction with loss function analysis based on the total error model, there is no need to consider the effects of synthetic error at this point.  Conclusion ESCAP II recommends that unadjusted Census 2000 data be used for non-redistricting purposes. The Committee was persuaded by new evidence indicating that the A.C.E. overstated the net undercount by at least 3 million individuals as a result of the survey's failure to measure a significant number of census erroneous enumerations. However, the Committee believes that, while Census 2000 successfully lowered the differential undercount, it did not eliminate it. Therefore, the Census Bureau will conduct further research and analyses to attempt to produce revised A.C.E. estimates that can be used to improve future post-censal estimates. The ESCAP II recommendation, if accepted, means that Census 2000 long form results will be weighted with unadjusted population counts, and that post-censal population estimates and survey controls will also rely on unadjusted data. The Census Bureau will continue research on the issues discovered with the A.C.E., particularly the issue of census duplicates and their estimation or detection. It is quite possible that this research will develop methods to improve future population estimates by combining information from the census, A.C.E., and the A.C.E. evaluations, including the Person Duplication Studies. Post-censal estimates and survey controls are updated annually, offering the opportunity to incorporate improvements. Even if the research does not lead to improved post-censal estimates, it will still further our understanding of the nature of census duplications and other erroneous enumerations, and the problems with their estimation by the A.C.E. This knowledge will be vitally important to the planning of the 2010 census and to the improvement of future coverage surveys. Both census taking and coverage measurement are processes that evolve and improve with each census. The Census 2000 experience will help refine both census and coverage measurement processes for future censuses.  Page 17 of 18   Attachments 1. List of ESCAP II Reports 2.

Policy (ESCAP) recommendation that the Census 2000 Redistricting Data not be adjusted based on the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) program data. The ESCAP was unable to conclude, based on information available at the time, that the adjusted Census 2000 data were more accurate for redistricting. By mid-October, the Census Bureau will recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for future uses, such as the census long form data products, post-censal population estimates and Census Bureau demographic survey controls. In order to inform this decision, further research will be conducted generating data for ESCAP's review. The analyses will focus on resolving the concerns that ESCAP identified during its deliberations for the redistricting adjustment decision. This document describes the research agenda and is organized by the topic areas of concern. The broad, overarching concern was that the Demographic Analysis and the A.C.E. estimates of the population were inconsistent. Even though alternative demographic estimates were produced by varying the assumptions underlying the Demographic Analysis, the highest reasonable estimate indicated that Census 2000 undercounted the population by 0.32 percent, while the A.C.E. produced a net undercount estimate of 1.15 percent1. In previous censuses since 1960, the Demographic Analysis estimates were used to evaluate decennial census coverage. The estimate derived through the 1990 coverage measurement survey was reasonably consistent with the 1990 Demographic Analysis estimate of the total population. When the corresponding estimates for Census 2000 were found to reflect substantial differences in the population estimates, this concerned the ESCAP. Four scenarios were identified that could explain this result:  The 1990 census coverage measurement survey (Post Enumeration Survey), 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates, and the 1990 census may have understated the Nation's population, while Census 2000 included portions of this previously unidentified population. Demographic Analysis estimates might not have captured the full growth between 1990 and 2000, specifically due to static assumptions about critical components of international migration such as unauthorized migration, temporary migration, and emigration.    The 1.15 percent and 0.32 percent of the undercount rates are based on census counts that include both the housing unit and group quarters populations. 1  1     Census 2000, as adjusted by the A.C.E., might overestimate the Nation's population. This situation raises the possibility of an undiscovered problem with the A.C.E. or Census 2000 methodology. A combination of these explanations.    To address these possibilities, further research is required into the quality of the three independent measures of the population - the Demographic Analysis estimate, the A.C.E. estimate and the census count itself. Specifically, research will address whether the Demographic Analysis estimate was too low and/or whether the adjusted estimate was too high. The latter situation could have occurred if either the A.C.E. did not measure the coverage error accurately or the census count had coverage error reflected by components not measured by the A.C.E. In addition, the ESCAP was concerned about two other issues related to the A.C.E. estimates balancing error and synthetic error. Balancing error occurs in the A.C.E. when cases are handled differently in the two independent samples (the P- and E- samples) when identifying gross omissions and erroneous enumerations. This is explained more fully under section B.1.a below. Synthetic error reflects the extent that net census coverage within a post-stratum is not relatively uniform. Uniformity of coverage is the underlying assumption of the synthetic estimation process of carrying coverage correction factors down to the block level. The concerns regarding synthetic error are described more fully in section D below. The analysis agenda is organized around four basic areas of research: 1) recalculation of Demographic Analysis estimates using new migration assumptions as well as new birth and death data, 2) A.C.E. issues, including balancing error, 3) Census 2000 issues and 4) synthetic error. A. Demographic Analysis (DA) Research This area of research addresses the discrepancy of the demographic analysis data and the A.C.E. adjusted estimates of population. Specifically, this area of research will reexamine the historic levels of the components of population change to address the scenarios dealing with the possibility that the 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates understated the Nation's population and that demographic analysis did not capture the full growth between 1990 and 2000. Consultation with demographic experts inside and outside the Census Bureau has led to a research program consisting of a variety of research projects focused on the methodologies and underlying estimates of the components of population change. The research activities are concentrated in two areas: 1. International Migration Assumptions regarding international migration are the most uncertain component of the demographic analysis estimates. The international migration component represents a combination of several components. Some of these components, e.g. legal immigration, are measured through continuous administrative data. For other components, e.g. temporary migration, emigration, and unauthorized migration, we do not have administrative data to provide continuous and current measurements. In the past, we 2   have relied upon the most recent decennial data to develop a once a decade measure of these components. Thus, for the 1990 to 2000 decade, we would have relied upon the measurement from the 1990 census to develop an estimate for the 1990 to 2000 decade. This work will involve examining preliminary data from the Census 2000 long form and the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) to provide information to update the measurement of the international migration components. Although the research will focus primarily on those components less well measured, e.g. emigration, temporary migration, and unauthorized immigration, the work will also include research into all of the current assumptions relating to the components of international migration The first goal is to validate for the 1990 to 2000 period, the calculation of the components of international migration used in previous estimates. Then, using the preliminary data from the Census 2000 long form and possibly the C2SS, we will develop some updated measures of the components of international migration. The second goal is to assess if the documented calculation of the 1990 to 2000 migration components affect the DA estimate for 2000 and thus account for some of the discrepancy with the A.C.E. results. Research to be conducted includes the following:  We will examine the assumptions about international migration flows, specifically for unauthorized migration, legal immigration, emigration, temporary migration, and migration from Puerto Rico. Utilizing preliminary long form data from Census 2000 and other information sources (including C2SS), we can prepare the first set of documentation for our current international migration assumptions and we can assess the accuracy of assuming a continuation of the estimates developed from the 1990 Census data. Specifically, we will estimate migration using available long-form data on place of birth, citizenship, and year of entry and compare this estimate to the estimates previously used that were developed from the 1990 Census long form data. Thus we will evaluate differences in size and characteristics of previously implied flows based on current data sets. If appropriate, we will recalculate the demographic analysis estimates for 2000 employing any revised levels of international migration. We will assess the quality of the foreign-born and Hispanic population data (important because these data are major inputs to the setting of assumptions noted above). We will review edit and allocation procedures for foreign-born and Hispanic populations in the 1990 and 2000 censuses and attempt to quantify the effect (or at least address the direction of the effect) of any differences. We also will review the impact of any change in the edits and allocation procedures on the size and characteristics of these population groups.    2. Robustness of Demographic Analysis In addition to the research aimed at examining the components of international migration used in the demographic analysis estimates, we will examine the remaining assumptions underlying the Demographic Analysis components of change. These components include the birth, death, and Medicare components. This work will entail the following:  We will examine the consistency of the components by cohort and age/sex groups across time (1935 to 2000), including the historical international migration 3   components. We will construct DA undercount rates for the 1940 to 2000 decennial censuses and examine them for consistency. We will examine the consistency of sex ratios across cohorts and age/sex groups. Inconsistent or anomalous results will be noted, and possible reasons identified.  We will review the assumptions about the completeness of vital statistics registration. Specifically, we will review the historic levels of births and deaths used to develop existing DA estimates and the assumptions about the underregistration of births and registration of infant deaths. We will evaluate both the procedures for adjusting births for underregistration and the level of historical deaths (both total and by age). If appropriate, we will redevelop the historical annual levels of births and deaths to 1990 and 2000. We will examine the assumptions about the variation and coverage of Medicare data. This work will include documenting the differences in the sources of Medicare data used in the 1990 and 2000 DA estimates, evaluating the adjustment rates used for underenrollment in the 1990 and 2000 DA estimates, and reconciling the differences in the Medicare files for 1990 and 2000. If appropriate, we will recalculate the demographic analysis estimates for 1990, compare them to the original 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates, and assess their impact on the DA estimates for 2000. We will analyze the consistency of DA estimates of the population, by race, ethnicity, and nativity, with Census 2000 and A.C.E. This work will entail 1) developing DA benchmarks of the population, by selected race, ethnicity, and nativity groups, 2) obtaining census tabulations of the native and foreign-born populations from preliminary Census 2000 and the 1990 Census long forms, and 3) comparing to the DA benchmarks to derive coverage estimates by selected age, sex, and race groups.        B. A.C.E. Issues and Planned Research 1. Major Areas of Research a. Balancing Error The A.C.E. was conducted using a defined area of search, the sample blocks and surrounding blocks for clusters selected for targeted extended search. There were concerns, since there was a change in the 1990 procedure of expanding the search area to surrounding blocks for all sample blocks. We found 3 million more matches in surrounding blocks than correct enumerations after expanding the search area. This difference must be explained in terms of its impact on subsequent estimates of total population. There are two scenarios: C The unit is located in the surrounding block with no effect on estimates of coverage, but would explain the three million difference.  4   C  The unit is outside the search area and the corresponding people should have been coded erroneous enumerations. This would result in an overestimate of the net undercount.  This may have been compounded by the targeting used in the A.C.E. to match in an area of search around the sample blocks, i.e., the search area. This targeting to make searching effective may have introduced limitations and/or biases into our measurement of coverage. There were three specific concerns in our review of the 2000 A.C.E. C There were a number of census people that might have been coded as correctly enumerated although the housing unit was not actually located in the sample block. If we didn't estimate the correct number of erroneously enumerated cases, the result would be an overestimate of the net undercount. The P-sample may have incorrectly included some housing units in a neighboring block, then in the extended search, the people would have been recorded as matching to the census in the surrounding blocks. Hence, these cases would appear to be balancing error when, in fact, the extended search was compensating for the original listing error. If the P sample had more geocoding error than expected, the Targeted Extended Search (TES) would have compensated for the error and the impact would be trivial and would have little or no impact on final coverage estimates. This would help explain some of the differences of the apparent lack of balance of 3 million.2 Problems in identifying census geocoding errors may have affected the sampling used to select people for extended search outside the sample blocks. That is, the TES sample could have excluded cases it should have included and thus, not matched or followed up on them correctly. The effect of their exclusion would be an overestimate of the net undercount.  C  C  It is likely that all of these errors occurred to some extent. What is not yet known is the scale of the error and whether the magnitude of the error was such as to significantly affect the relative accuracy of the A.C.E. adjusted numbers. The additional geographic field work is described in more detail in the attachment. b. Erroneous Enumerations Subsequent to the March 1st decision, a new area of concern was identified. In comparing the A.C.E. measures to the comparable measures from the 1990 Census, the Census 2000 erroneous enumerations were found to differ substantially from the 1990 measures. These differences indicate concerns that the level of erroneous  Assume 2.6 million of the P-sample are listed in the surrounding blocks. If 95% of them are in the search area (a plausible percentage), and if 90% match (about the overall match rate), then we have accounted for 2.2 million matches to the surrounding blocks. When we divide this 2.2 million by the P-sample coverage of 0.94, we have accounted for about 2.36 million of the 3 million lack of balance. 5  2   enumerations may be understated for Census 2000. Therefore, these differences must be explained because an understatement of erroneous enumerations results in an overstatement of net undercount. Research described below will quantify the accuracy of the A.C.E. measures of erroneous enumeration. C The Analysis of Measurement Error Study will determine how well the A.C.E. identified erroneous enumerations and correct enumerations. This study is based on a reinterview of a sample of E-sample records. This is described more fully in section B.1.c below. Another evaluation based on results from the `E-sample Erroneous Enumeration Study' will analyze the erroneous enumerations for various characteristics. This evaluation will compare the rates of the different types of erroneous enumerations for Census 2000 with corresponding 1990 rates. This evaluation will also recategorize people with unresolved status into the appropriate erroneous enumeration categories by using data from the followup forms. The goal of this work will identify explanations for differences between 1990 and 2000 coding of erroneous enumerations. The duplication study discussed in Section C1 will also provide information regarding the differences between 1990 and 2000. This study will validate whether the A.C.E. process is correctly coding census 2000 duplicate enumerations as erroneous.  C  C  c. Total Error Model and Loss Functions Loss function analyses, reviewed by the ESCAP during its deliberations on whether to adjust the census redistricting data, were based on a total error model that corrected the A.C.E. for biases, thus producing measures of the ""true"" population that could be used as standards for comparing the adjusted and unadjusted census results. The 1990 total error model was adapted to the extent possible to ""fit"" the 1990 coverage measurement survey error components into the 2000 survey design. This model was updated with available Census 2000 data, but retained several error component measures obtained from the 1990 coverage measurement survey and 1990 evaluations, because the 2000 A.C.E. evaluation data were not yet available. Thus, the error model assumed that the actual A.C.E. error rates for these components were similar to those reflected by the 1990 coverage measurement survey results. This was viewed as conservative because it was expected that the A.C.E. was of higher quality than the 1990 coverage measurement survey. Work is underway to validate that the assumption above is correct. We are conducting studies to revise the 1990 total error model to reflect actual A.C.E. error components, as measured by 2000 evaluations. Because of methodological changes between 1990 and 2000, there are issues that influence the comparability of this updated analysis to the March 2001 analysis. The analysis will include a discussion of the comparability.  6   The A.C.E. error components that were previously based on 1990 data will now be measured and input into the revised total error model are: P-sample P-sample P-sample E-sample matching error data collection error discrepancy error processing and data collection errors  Synthetic error is not included in the total error model -- this component of error is discussed later. A.C.E. error rates for these total error model components will be obtained from the following evaluation studies.  The Matching Error Study will provide the A.C.E. P-sample matching error rate and E-sample processing error rates. The methodology consists of the clerical rematching of all of the people in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. clusters by expert matchers to determine the best match code possible. We will compare that match and residence information to the production codes. The Analysis of Measurement Error Study uses the results of the Evaluation Followup Interview to provide the error components for E-sample and P-sample data collection error relating to person coverage, and P-sample discrepancy error. The methodology consists of revisiting some of the households in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. clusters and using that information to rematch the Census and A.C.E. people in those households. The results of this study will determine the accuracy of the data going into the person matching process, such as the results from Census and A.C.E. questionnaires. This can involve reclassification of correct and erroneous enumerations. We will determine the accuracy of the residence status of A.C.E. people and how well the A.C.E. process identified Census erroneous enumerations (EEs) and correct enumerations (CEs).    Once the total error model is updated with current data, new loss function analyses will be conducted. The loss function analyses will be expanded to analyze the accuracy of governmental units, in addition to states and counties. No loss function analyses will be run for congressional districts. d. Correlation Bias Correlation bias in Dual System Estimates (DSEs) results from a failure of the general independence assumption underlying DSEs due either to causal dependence or heterogeneity. Causal dependence occurs when the act of being included in the census makes someone more likely or less likely to be included in the A.C.E. Heterogeneity occurs when the census and A.C.E. inclusion probabilities vary over persons within post-strata. When heterogeneity within post-strata exists it is generally suspected to be of the form where persons more likely to be missed in the Census are also more likely to be missed in the coverage survey (A.C.E.). This will lead to underestimation of true population by the DSEs. The direction of the effect of causal dependence, if it exists, is less certain. 7   Correlation bias in the A.C.E. estimates, whether due to heterogeneity or causal dependence, was assessed by comparing A.C.E. and DA results. Correlation bias estimates available for the March 1, 2001 ESCAP recommendation used DA estimates as of February 26, 2001. If further DA research results in revisions to the DA estimates, then the correlation bias estimates will be recomputed. The revised correlation bias estimates will then be used as inputs for revisions of the total error model and loss function analyses. 2. Auxiliary Areas of Research This section describes other areas that did not preclude ESCAP from recommending that Census 2000 data should be adjusted for redistricting purposes, but for which ESCAP would have preferred additional data. Further research in these areas will be conducted in order to confirm the ESCAP's conclusions. a. Missing Data Missing data occurs in the A.C.E. if after all followup attempts there remain households that were not interviewed or households with some portions of the person data missing such as age or race. Sometimes the missing item involves the status of whether a person matched, was a resident on Census day or was correctly enumerated. For a small number of people in the P-Sample, there was not enough information available to determine the match status (whether or not the person matched to someone in the census in the appropriate search area) or the resident status (whether or not the person was living in the block cluster on Census Day). Determining residence status was important for the P-Sample because Census Day residents of the block clusters in the sample were used to estimate the proportion of the population who were not counted in the census. Similarly, some people in the E-Sample lacked information to determine whether the person was correctly enumerated. Generally for cases with missing status a probability of resident, match, or correct enumeration was assigned based on information available about the specific case and about cases with similar characteristics. The rates of occurrence of unresolved A.C.E. cases for match status, correct enumeration status, and mover status were viewed as low enough to preclude serious biases in the A.C.E. results. We are now doing analysis of the missing data model to determine if the assumptions are correct. We will develop and apply alternative models for the treatment of missing data. These alternative models will be carried through A.C.E. estimation process so that the effect on DSEs can be assessed. b. Late Census 2000 Additions The levels of late Census 2000 additions were significantly higher than in the 1990 census. Late additions are those persons included in the final census counts, but which due to their late inclusion were excluded from in the A.C.E. matching and dual 8   system estimation processes. For Census 2000, the late additions consisted exclusively of housing units that were temporarily removed from the census because they were suspected to duplicate other housing units, but which were later (after the A.C.E. matching process started) reinstated into the final census after further research was conducted. This differs from the 1990 Census in which the late additions were persons who were enumerated too late in the census cycle to be included in the matching and dual system estimation processes and were not factored into the coverage ratios. The A.C.E. design treated the late census data appropriately in measuring the census undercount. Two areas of concern require further investigation -- whether calculating DSEs without these additions resulted in a bias in the estimates and whether these impacted the assumptions underlying the synthetic estimation model. There is no expectation of a bias in the dual system estimate caused by excluding late additions. The dual system estimate can be expressed as a product of the 1) number of A.C.E. people and 2) the ratio of census complete and correct enumerations to the number of people in both systems. Consequently, any effect must come from one of these two sources. Excluding the late additions does not impact the estimate of the number of A.C.E. people, which come solely from the A.C.E. enumerated sample. Excluding the late additions also will not affect the dual system estimate of the true population if the number of matches is reduced proportionately to the number of census correct enumerations. Given the traditional dual system independence assumption, one would expect this result. Consequently, there is no expectation of a bias in the dual system estimate caused by excluding late additions. Data were not available at the time to validate this assumption. We will now attempt to validate this assumption by performing a rematch of the Pand E-samples, with the late additions included in the E-sample, to attempt to measure the impact on the rates for correct enumerations and duplicates. This rematch will be conducted in a one-fifth subsample of A.C.E. clusters. This study has limitations because only computer and clerical matching can now be performed; that is, no field work will be conducted. Consequently, a high rate of unresolved cases is expected. The concerns regarding synthetic error are addressed in Section D. ""Synthetic Error"". c. Conditioning Conditioning error occurs under two scenarios: 1. Census data collection affects the A.C.E. This will be measured in the correlation bias. 2. A.C.E data collection affects the census. This will be examined in the evaluation described below.  9   The effect of potential conditioning of Census 2000 respondents by the A.C.E. operations was assumed to be minimal, similar to the 1990 findings. The research is necessary to confirm this assumption. An evaluation will examine whether census and A.C.E. operations were kept operationally independent. The analysis will be based on comparing Census 2000 results in A.C.E. and non-A.C.E. blocks.  Mover Status Analysis The match rate portion of the DSE formula (M/P) uses persons with all types of mover status (nonmovers, outmovers, and inmovers), differentiating between the different types of mover status. Therefore, misclassification of mover status could cause the DSEs to be overstated, understated, or both, depending on the post-strata. The Measurement Error Reinterview Analysis will measure the extent of mover misclassification by using the results from the Evaluation Followup Interview.  Housing Unit Coverage The coverage of housing units will be available in the late summer of 2001. These data will be examined in relation to person coverage estimates for 2000. These data from 2000 will be compared to the 1990 estimates of person and housing unit coverage. In addition, another study will assess the impact of housing unit coverage on person coverage. This study looks at the P-sample to analyze the effect of housing unit nonmatches on the person nonmatches. The E-sample is also examined to help understand the relationship of housing unit status to person status. The correctly enumerated people in erroneously enumerated housing units are of particular interest.  P-sample Nonmatch Analysis The P-sample nonmatches are examined for variables such as race domain and age/sex group to see if the nonmatches are different for various types of people. This aids in the understanding of the components of A.C.E. and also helps explain the differences between A.C.E. and DA. In addition, the nonmatches from 2000 are compared to the nonmatches from 1990. In conjunction with the analysis of the E-sample, it helps explain the differences between 1990 and 2000. C. Census 2000 Issues and Planned Research Research will be conducted into two components of the census - duplication issues and imputation of persons. A high level of duplication not measured by the A.C.E. design could cause the adjusted census estimate to be too high. The effect of imputed persons records are also not measured by the A.C.E. The number of person records that were imputed in Census 10   2000 was significantly higher than in the 1990 census. The assumption is that the imputed persons are no different than the persons included in the A.C.E. process and therefore match rates are not impacted. 1. Duplication Not Measured in A.C.E. The A.C.E. methodology by design did not measure duplication between components of the population living in group quarters and in housing units because group quarters were outside the A.C.E. universe. The A.C.E. also did not measure duplication within the group quarters population. Significant duplication of these types could explain some of the differences between demographic analysis and the adjusted Census 2000 data. The A.C.E. E-sample will be computer matched to the entire census to determine the extent of duplicate enumerations that were not in scope for the A.C.E. This analysis will potentially explain some of the differences between demographic analysis and the A.C.E. We also plan an extended computer search within the A.C.E. E-sample for duplicate census enumerations among housing units and also between housing units and group quarters persons (which were out-of-scope for A.C.E.) This will help to explain differences between the A.C.E. and the 1990 coverage measurement survey. 2. Census Person Imputations Census 2000 imputed a higher number of cases than in the 1990 census that came through the process with little or no information as to the occupancy status, or with an occupied status, but with no definitive population count. In addition, Census 2000 imputed more whole person records in cases with known household sizes, but with all the person data missing for some or all of the household members. Although the A.C.E. handled imputed persons appropriately in the estimation process, there was concern about not having information as to what census design processes contributed to the number of imputed persons when compared to the 1990 census. Given the potential impact that this level of imputations may have on Census 2000 data, it is essential to understand the demographic characteristics of the imputed people and how this may help explain the difference between the census and demographic analysis, as well as, how the imputations affect differences between the E-sample in 1990 and the E-sample in 2000. There were concerns expressed regarding the effect of whole household imputations on the heterogeneity assumption but these concerns are studied under the synthetic error analysis in Section D. D. Synthetic Error The synthetic assumption states that census net coverage does not vary within post-strata. For example, the synthetic assumption implies that census counts in Florida in a particular Hispanic post-stratum have the same net coverage as the census counts in the same Hispanic post-stratum but in New York. The synthetic assumption within post-strata will permit the 11   Census Bureau to draw conclusions from the A.C.E. sample about the population as a whole and then apply them to individuals living in geographic areas smaller than post-strata. The synthetic assumption is necessary to permit correction for small geographic areas based on a sample. This adjustment is only correcting for systematic biases and not local census errors. The error that is introduced when the synthetic assumption does not hold is called synthetic error. Synthetic estimation methodology is directed at correcting for a systematic under- or overcount in the census. The synthetic estimates will not result in the correction of random counting errors that occur for any entity (blocks tracts, counties, etc). Therefore, the synthetic estimate will not result in extreme changes in small geographic entities, nor will it correct for extreme errors. It is designed to remove the effects of systematic errors so that when small entities are aggregated, systematic and differential coverage errors are corrected. In the assessment of accuracy, the Census Bureau is concerned with synthetic error since it is not included directly in the total error model. The analysis of the effects of synthetic error were based on the construction of ""artificial populations."" These are populations that are created with surrogate variables that are known for the entire population, and are developed to reflect the distribution of net coverage error. This analysis of synthetic error and its effect on the loss functions was limited. Our additional analysis will expand the scope of the earlier artificial population work and add an approach using direct estimates of coverage at lower geographic levels. 1. Using Artificial Populations We will do a sensitivity analysis on the results from B-14. B-14 gave results for weighted and unweighted loss functions using one of two methods for distributing targets to post-strata and one of 8 models for correlation bias and percent of 1990 processing bias. This work will concentrate on the weighted loss functions and analyze the sensitivity of the B-14 results over both the methods for distributing targets to post-strata and all 8 models. Once again this analysis will be conducted for states and congressional districts. 2. Using Direct Estimates We will calculate direct DSEs for census divisions and for states having sufficient sample size to produce direct estimates with reasonably low variance. Assuming the resulting direct DSE population estimates are unbiased, the mean square error of the production synthetic estimate of total population will be estimated. E. Schedule Some of the A.C.E. evaluation work being undertaken involves field work and/or additional computer or clerical matching work. The Evaluation Followup Interview was conducted in the field during the winter of 2001. The Matching Error Study matching work was completed in the spring. Results from these studies are being processed, with initial data being available for review in early summer. Field and clerical work for the TES2 and TES3 12   (described in the attachment) studies began in the winter and will continue into July. Results from these studies won't be available for ESCAP review until later in the summer. Matching for the late census adds evaluation is scheduled for late-July, with data available for review in August. Other research is being conducted on a flow basis as data become available and analyses are conducted. The ESCAP began holding weekly (or more frequent) meetings to review analyses of data related to the topics of concern beginning on June 18. It is expected that all of the research and analyses described will be completed by the end of September. The ESCAP will then discuss how the results impact their concerns and will make a recommendation by midOctober as to whether adjusted or non-adjusted census data should be used for subsequent purposes. During the September through October time frame, analysts will document the results of their research in evaluation reports, finalizing them in time for release to the public concurrently with the ESCAP recommendation.  13   Attachment 3  Field Operations to Answer the Concerns About Lack of Balance In order to answer these concerns and explain the lack of balance present due to Targeted Extended Search (TES) and to explain the lack of balance that may be introduced due to TES, we will be examining the results of Targeted Extended Search 2 (TES2) and Targeted Extended Search 3 (TES3). TES2 followed up E-sample housing units that were coded as erroneous enumerations in the initial housing unit phase to determine if the unit was inside or outside the block cluster and surrounding rings. TES3 will followup other types of units, both P-sample and E-sample, that may contribute to a lack of balance. In TES2 we are evaluating the housing units coded during the housing unit matching as not existing as housing units within the cluster. The block containing the housing unit selected for additional geographic work and the surrounding blocks were identified on a map. The field representative identified the block where the housing unit existed and the housing unit was classified as: C C C C C Existing in the surrounding blocks Existing outside the surrounding blocks Existing within the block cluster Not a housing unit Unresolved  So, a housing unit may be coded as in surrounding blocks or outside the search area when it was part of the block cluster. In TES3 we are also sending to the field a sample of census housing units classified as correctly enumerated in the block cluster. If a housing unit was classified as correctly enumerated in the block cluster in error, the housing unit was not eligible for targeted extended search in person matching. This could explain more of the lack of balance identified in the person matching. In addition, we are sending additional types of P-sample cases for more geographic field work and a sample of matches in the sample block as a control. These types of cases are: C C C P-sample people matched in surrounding blocks Not matched P-sample housing units P-sample people matched in the sample block cluster"

I nt r o duc t i o n The Census 2000 Testing, Experimentation, and Evaluation Program provides measures of effectiveness for the Census 2000 design, operations, systems, and processes and provides information on the value of new or different methodologies. The results and recommendations from these analyses provide valuable information crucial to planning the 2010 Census. By providing measures of how well Census 2000 was conducted, this program fully supports the Census Bureau's strategy to integrate the 2010 planning process with ongoing Master Address File/TIGER enhancements and the American Community Survey. The purpose of the report that follows is to synthesize results from related Census 2000 evaluations, experiments, and other assessments to make recommendations for planning the 2010 Census. Census 2000 Testing, Experimentation, and Evaluation reports are available on the Census Bureau' Internet site at: s http://www.census.gov/pred/www/. The reports and documentation of the Executive Steering Committee for the A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) are located at: http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/EscapRep.html, http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/EscapRep2.html, and http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/ace2.html.  The Census Bureau conducted the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) expecting it could be used to adjust the Census 2000 results for all non-apportionment purposes if it improved the census data. The original March 2001 A.C.E. estimates became available in time to correct the Census 2000 redistricting files. On March 1, 2001, the Census Bureau released the ""Report of the Executive Steering Committee for Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Policy"" which reported that ""The Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) is unable to conclude, based on the information available at this time, that the adjusted Census 2000 data are more accurate for redistricting. Accordingly, ESCAP recommends that the unadjusted census data be released as the Census Bureau's official redistricting data."" (ESCAP, 2001.) The ESCAP noted the difference between the A.C.E. estimate, a 3.3 million net undercount, and Demographic Analysis (DA) results, a 1.8 million net overcount. The Census Bureau conducted further evaluations over the next six months to examine this difference and determine if Census 2000 data, other than redistricting data, should be corrected. Two planned A.C.E. evaluation programs, the Matching Error Study (MES) (Bean, 2001) and the Evaluation Followup (EFU) (Raglin and Krejsa, Report 3, 2001), identified errors in the A.C.E. The Person Duplication Study (Mule, Report 20, 2001) used computer matching to identify duplicates across the entire country and Feldpausch (2001) examined the enumeration status assigned to the E sample for these duplicates. Adams and Krejsa (2001) re-coded the enumeration status to reduce any operational and procedural errors in the original enumeration status coding. Additional evaluations addressed other concerns (ESCAP II, 2001) including A.C.E. balancing, contamination, and missing data. The DA estimates were investigated further resulting in revisions (particularly migration estimates) and revised DA estimates. (Robinson, Report 1, 2001.) Due to uncertainty whether all errors associated with the A.C.E. (e.g. duplication error) were captured, results from the total error model designed to synthesize individual errors and the -1-    associated loss function analysis were not used. (Petroni, 2001.) On October 17, 2001, the Census Bureau released ""Report of the Executive Steering Committee for Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Policy on Adjustment for Non-Redistricting Uses"" which reported, The Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) recommended on March 1, 2001 that unadjusted census data be used for redistricting. After assessing considerable new evidence, ESCAP now recommends that unadjusted Census 2000 data also be used for non-redistricting purposes. The effect of this new evidence is that the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) overstated the net undercount by at least 3 million persons. The cause of this error was that the A.C.E. failed to measure a significant number of census erroneous enumerations, many of which were duplicates. This level of error in the A.C.E. measurement of net coverage is such that the A.C.E. results cannot be used in their current form. This finding of substantial error, in conjunction with remaining uncertainties, necessitates that revisions, based on additional review and analysis, be made to the A.C.E. estimates before any potential uses of these data can be considered. The Census Bureau will release the remaining Census 2000 data products, post-censal estimates, and survey controls using unadjusted data. It is, however, reasonable to expect that further research and analysis may lead to revised A.C.E. estimates that can be used to improve future post-censal estimates. (ESCAP II, 2001.) Coupled with the revisions to the DA estimates, the inconsistency with DA was explained by the failure of the A.C.E. to measure a large number of census erroneous enumerations. The earlier concerns in A.C.E. with balancing, contamination, and missing data were also resolved. The level of other errors was believed to be small by comparison and therefore was not a major factor in the second ESCAP decision. (Hogan et al., 2002; Mulry and Petroni, 2002; ESCAP II, 2001.) In October 2001, the Census Bureau released approximate estimates of the undercount for three race/Hispanic origin groups. (Thompson et al., 2001.) These ""Revised Early Approximations"" corrected estimates of erroneous enumerations for census duplicates and for other erroneous enumerations identified in the A.C.E. evaluations but not in the full A.C.E. E sample. This illustrated the correction effects on net undercount estimates and on possible coverage differences. The Census Bureau later used the same methods and data to expand the calculations to seven race/Hispanic origin groups. (Fay, 2002; Mule, 2002.) These preliminary estimates showed, like the revised DA results, a small net undercount and that the differential undercount was reduced, but not eliminated. These results only provided data at the national level for broad population groups. Furthermore, these preliminary approximations were based on a small subset of A.C.E. data and only partially corrected for errors in measuring erroneous enumerations using Fay's lower bound. (Fay, 2001, Fay, 2002.) Potential errors in measuring omissions were not -2-    accounted for. Even though the ESCAP recommended twice NOT to correct the census counts, they had concerns about differential coverage in Census 2000. They thought further research on revised coverage estimates could be used to improve the post-censal estimates. Work on revised estimates would provide a better understanding of Census 2000 coverage error that could be used to improve the 2010 Census and develop better methods for the 2010 coverage measurement program. Hence, work began on revising the A.C.E. estimates to correct for detected errors. The results can be found in the ""Technical Assessment of A.C.E. Revision II"". (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003.) The following report is divided into three sections discussing the comparison of March 2001 A.C.E. coverage estimates with Demographic Analysis, March 2001 A.C.E. person estimates, and A.C.E. housing unit estimates. The conclusions and recommendations are based on the March 2001 A.C.E., work done prior to the A.C.E. Revision II. The recommendations for the 2010 Census assume the Census Bureau decides to do a similar approach to undercount estimation using a coverage measurement survey. The research and results from A.C.E. Revision II are out of scope for this report due to resource constraints. The coverage estimates from A.C.E. Revision II are considered better than the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates. In fact the earlier coverage estimates are considered flawed and are not indicative of the Census 2000 coverage error. To avoid misunderstandings, earlier flawed estimates are referred to as March 2001 A.C.E. in the remainder of the report. A list of the evaluations and other reports used in this topic report are in the references section. All evaluations discussed in this report are based on the March 2001 A.C.E. The housing unit coverage estimates did not have the exhaustive evaluation that was conducted for the person estimates and A.C.E. Revision II did not attempt to revise the housing unit coverage estimates. The difficulties in identifying residence in the person estimates should not affect our ability to identify the existence of a housing unit on Census Day. However, to the extent not identifying erroneous census enumerations or duplicates was large for the household, then this could have affected the reliability of some of the housing estimates by householder characteristics such as occupancy status, race, or owner status.  1.1 The Census Design Census 2000 paralleled the design of other recent U.S. Decennial Censuses in many respects. Census 2000 attempted to enumerate all people living in the United States on April 1, 2000. Most of the population was enumerated by means of mailback questionnaires delivered to their homes in March 2000. The mailback questionnaire asked, ""How many people were living or staying in this house, apartment, or mobile home on April 1, 2000?"", then asked respondents to answer questions for each person. Respondents were given guidance about whom to include (""foster children, roomers, or housemates""; ""people staying here on April 1, 2000 who have no other permanent place to stay""; ""people living here most of the time while working, even if they -3-    have another place to live"") and whom to exclude (""college students living away while attending college""; ""people in a correctional facility, nursing home, or mental hospital on April 1, 2000"" ; ""Armed Forces personnel living somewhere else""; ""people who live or stay at another place most of the time""). People who did not respond by mail were enumerated in person by enumerators who visited their homes during Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) between April 27 and June 26. In most cases, NRFU interviewers spoke to a member of the nonresponding household, but after they had attempted repeatedly to contact nonresponding households, they were allowed to obtain basic data about the residents from proxy respondents, such as neighbors, landlords, or other nonhousehold members. (Martin, Fay, and Krejsa, November 2002.) People in group quarters (such as college dormitories, homeless shelters, and nursing homes) were enumerated in separate operations at the facilities, where enumerators listed the names of the people living or staying there and left Individual Census Reports for each person to complete. Enumerators picked up the forms and, if necessary, conducted interviews with nonrespondents. (Martin, Fay, and Krejsa, November 2002.) Two basic errors affected the population total from the census: omissions of persons who should have been counted, and erroneous enumerations of persons who should not have been counted, such as fictitious persons or persons counted more than once. Persons were considered omitted if they were not counted in the right geographic area and erroneously included if they were incorrectly counted in a different area. The A.C.E. defined omissions and erroneous enumerations with respect to a relatively small geographic area called the search area, which was typically a block or group of blocks and in some cases blocks immediately surrounding the sample blocks. Under this approach, people counted in the wrong block were classified as omitted from where they should have been counted and erroneously enumerated where they were counted. (Martin, Fay, and Krejsa, November 2002.) In the decennial census, the Census Bureau attempted to enumerate each person at his or her ""usual residence"" as of April 1st, defined as the place where a person lived or slept most of the time. The basic usual residence principle was based on 31 residence rules which apply to special circumstances: for example, people who were staying in most types of institutional settings or other group quarters (e.g., dormitory, shelter, or nursing home) on April 1st were enumerated there, even if they also had another residence. The instructions on the census form described the most common living situations, but respondents often find the rules self-contradictory and the terminology confusing. (Martin, Fay, Krejsa, 2002.) Also, some types of noninstitutional group quarters allowed the respondent to indicate they should have been counted at their usual home.  1.2 Coverage Measurement The A.C.E. attempted to measure net undercount through a sample survey. Conceptually, an independent sample of the population, the P sample, was used to estimate the omissions. A sample of census enumerations, the E sample, was selected from census enumerations to determine erroneous enumerations. Together they were used to estimate the net coverage error. -4-    Omissions and erroneous enumerations be estimates of gross errors. Following geographically overlapped the P sample blocks.

They are not meant to the precedent of the 1990 coverage study, the A.C.E. and E sample by selecting them from the same sample of ion for March 2001 Estimates"" in Kostanich (2003) for  The housing unit stage of A.C.E. was a combination of sampling and operational activities which resulted in the selection of 300,000 P-sample housing units from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, excluding areas of remote Alaska. The selection was independent of any census operation. A detailed description of the A.C.E. sampling plan can be found in ZuWallack, Salganik, Cromar, and Mule (2000). The A.C.E. comprised several operations, but five primary operations are critical in the analysis that follows. For more details see Childers (2001). The ""Glossary of Specialized and Technical Terms Used in the ESCAP Report and Supporting Documents"" is a helpful source for defining terms used throughout this report. (ESCAP II, Chapter VIII, 2002.)  An initial interview of P-sample households was conducted by phone (April 24 through June 13) or by personal visit (June 18 through September 11), using a computer-assisted instrument on a laptop. The interview established both the current residents and, if different, the Census Day residents of the sampled housing units. The interview was conducted only with a household member for the first three weeks of interviewing. If the interview with a household member was not successful after three weeks, an interview with a proxy respondent, which is a nonhousehold member, was attempted. The Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instrument was designed to obtain a roster of the current residents and the residents on Census Day, measure their demographic characteristics such as sex, age, race, and ethnicity, and determine whether each identified Census Day resident should have been included in the census in the housing unit or somewhere else. In October through November 2000, P-sample Census Day residents1 were matched to the census. If the A.C.E. interview established the Census Day address for a P-sample person and if that person matched a person enumerated in the Census, then the P-sample person was considered matched to the census and the corresponding E-sample person classified as a correct enumeration. Some categories of P-sample people who did not match to the census were sent to the A.C.E. Person Followup (PFU) because the Census Bureau was not absolutely certain about the information provided in the original interview. The categories included not      The Census Day residents are both the nonmovers and the outmovers. Nonmovers lived at the sample address on Census Day and at the time of the A.C.E. interview. Outmovers lived there on Census Day, but not on the day of the A.C.E. interview. -5-  1   matched people from proxy interviews, from conflicting households2, and from households where some people matched. The followup interview identified P-sample people who were not residents of the housing unit on Census Day who were then removed from the P sample. The followup interview also included all not matched E-sample cases in order to identify erroneous enumerations. Because they were matched, the majority of census enumerations in the E sample required no separate field work. Followup interviews were conducted in person from October 19 through November 21, 2000, using a questionnaire preprinted with name and address information about the sample household. Interviews were accepted with non-household proxies if knowledgeable household respondents were not found after six contact attempts on different times on different days.  Despite extensive attempts to interview every housing unit in the P sample, there were households for which the Census Bureau simply could not obtain information. To account for the missing information from these households not interviewed, the Census Bureau applied a noninterview adjustment to interviewed units. Furthermore, although most P-sample people were assigned a residence and match status, and E-sample people an enumeration status, a small number of people remained with one or more of these statuses unresolved. That is, the Census Bureau may not have been sure if a person was actually a resident of the housing unit on Census Day, or if another person was correctly enumerated in the census. For these people with an unresolved status, the Census Bureau assigned a probability of having lived in the block cluster on Census Day, having matched, or having been correctly enumerated. See Cantwell et. al. (2001) for a discussion of the A.C.E. missing data procedures. The results of matching the P sample and E sample were used to produce population estimates using Dual System Estimation(DSE). The DSE is a technique that estimates the true population using estimates of the number of census enumerations correctly included in the census from the E sample and the ratio of the number of people who should have been included and were correctly included in the census to the total population from the P sample. See Sekar and Deming (1949), Wolter (1986), and Hogan (1993) for more information about Dual System Estimation. Estimates of the population are made within estimation cells, called post-strata defined by geography and demographic variables. The sum of the estimate of the population across estimation cells is the Dual System Estimate of the population. The net undercount is the difference in the Dual System Estimate of the population and the number of people counted in the census. The percent net undercount is the net undercount divided by the number of people counted in the Dual System Estimate of the population.    A conflicting household refers to the households at a matched, non-vacant address or individual housing unit, where the A.C.E. household and census household do not contain any matched or possibly matched people. -6-  2   Table 1 compares percent net undercount estimates from the flawed March 2001 A.C.E. and the 1990 Post Enumeration Survey (PES) for major groups. The A.C.E. estimates were later revised. (See U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2003.) Comparisons here show results before those revisions. The DSE shows Census 2000 undercounted the national household population and that undercounts differed by population subgroups. Relative to the 1990 census, Census 2000 showed an apparent improvement in the overall percent net undercount and the differential undercounts of certain population groups. The national percent net undercount of the household population for Census 2000 is 1.18 percent (standard error, 0.13 percent) compared to the 1990 Census 1.61 percent (standard error, 0.20 percent). The Census 2000 coverage showed differential undercount rates among the race/origin domains, tenure, and age/sex groups. The percent net undercount for the Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic domains is lower for Census 2000 compared to the 1990 Census, which results in a differential undercount reduction relative to the Non-Hispanic White and ""Some other race"" domain. The Census 2000 percent undercount for Non-Owners and for children ages 0 to 17 is lower than in 1990.

The major differences are as follows:  The sample was 166,000 housing units in 1990 and 300,000 in 2000. -8-           In 1990 the universe was housing units and noninstitutional nonmilitary group quarters. The universe for 2000 was housing units only. In 1990 large block subsampling was a clerical operation. In 2000 housing unit matching was conducted before the interviewing allowing the large block subsampling to be done by computer. The interview was a paper operation in 1990 and in 2000 the interview was computer assisted. In 1990 the P sample was the current residents3 and the Census Bureau matched the inmovers to their Census Day address. In 1990 the search area was the sample blocks and one ring of surrounding blocks in urban areas, two rings of surrounding blocks in rural areas, and in a larger area of blocks for the most rural areas of the country. In 2000 the P sample was the Census Day residents and they were matched to the census enumerations in the block cluster and surrounding blocks for selected clusters. (This is referred to as the Targeted Extended Search.) In 1990 all whole household P-sample not matched people were sent for a followup interview. In 2000 P-sample not matched people from housing units interviewed with household members were not sent for followup.  2. Demographic Analysis: Comparison with March 2001 A.C.E. Coverage Estimates Demographic Analysis (DA) is a well-developed tool for evaluating population coverage. The DA is an analytic approach that has been extensively used at the Census Bureau to measure coverage of the national population in every census since 1960 (Siegel and Zelnik, 1966; Fay et. al., 1974, 1988; Robinson et. al., 1993; Robinson, March 2001.) Demographic Analysis represents a macro-level approach for estimating the net undercount by comparing aggregate sets of data or counts. The demographic approach differs fundamentally from the survey-based A.C.E. The traditional DA population benchmarks are developed for the census date by analyzing various types of demographic data essentially independent of the census, such as administrative statistics on births, deaths, authorized international migration, and Medicare enrollments, as well as estimates of legal emigration and net unauthorized immigration. The difference between the Demographic Analysis benchmarks and the census count provides an estimate of the census net undercount. Dividing the net undercount by the DA benchmark provides an estimate of the net undercount rate. (Robinson, March 2001.) Demographic Analysis estimates were inconsistent with March 2001 A.C.E. estimates. The Census Bureau expected demographic analysis to posit a higher estimate of the total population than the March 2001 A.C.E. because of the presence of correlation bias, and that the two  The current residents are the people who lived interview in 1990, which are the nonmovers and address on Census Day and at the time of the PE Census Day but moved to the address before the  3  in the housing unit at the time of the PES inmovers. The nonmovers lived at the sample S interview. The inmovers did not live there on date of the PES interview.  -9-   estimates would generally agree on the coverage of certain populations. Instead, the Base DA estimates4 were lower than both the Census 2000 population counts and the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates. In response, the Census Bureau developed Alternative DA estimates by doubling the unauthorized immigration assumed in the 1990s5. Doing so yielded a number of foreign born for 2000 consistent with the March 2000 Current Population Survey.6 Still, the Alternative DA estimated numbers produced in February 2001, were significantly lower than the March 2001 A.C.E. The Alternative DA indicated that Census 2000 undercounted the population by 0.32 percent, while the March 2001 A.C.E. produced a net undercount estimate of 1.15 percent.7 The Census Bureau concluded that the inconsistent estimates of the total national population derived from one or more of three explanations:  C  All available 1990 census data, including the census results, the 1990 coverage measurement survey, and the 1990 DA estimates, significantly understated the Nation's population, but Census 2000 found this previously unenumerated population. DA underestimated population growth between 1990 and 2000. The March 2001 A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's population.  C C  Further research on demographic analysis focused on two main topics: international migration and measurement of vital events like births and deaths. (ESCAP II, 2001.)  2.1 International Migration The Census Bureau regarded the international migration assumptions as the most uncertain component in the demographic analysis estimates completed by March 1, 2001. Research after March 1, 2001 focused primarily on those international migration components that are less well measured (e.g., emigration, temporary migration, and unauthorized migration). It also included research into legal immigration and the demographic characteristics of migrants used in the  Base DA estimates refer to the Demographic Analysis estimates produced in January 2001 by the Census Bureau for Census 2000. The process of revising the Demographic Analysis estimates made use of Census 2000 long form data to revise estimates of the foreign born population. The March Current Population Survey was reweighted using the Census 2000 counts by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin for this comparison. This figure differs from the 1.18 percent usually quoted for the March 2001 A.C.E. because the A.C.E. and DA estimate different populations. The base of the DA percent is the total population, while the base of the A.C.E. percent is the household population, which excludes group quarters. -107 6 5  4   March 2001 DA estimates. Part of the analysis involved discussions with independent experts on demographic analysis and international migration. Participants of a March 20, 2001 meeting explained how the DA estimates differed from the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates, and discussed how to prioritize short-term and long-term research activities. Attendees included experts from the statistical community, academia, state agencies, the Census Bureau's advisory committees, professional organizations, and international organizations. These experts, almost unanimously, recommended focusing on components of international migration because of the uncertainty of associated assumptions and estimates. The Census Bureau sought expert help on September 24, 2001, after completing the original research activities (validation of the 1990 estimates and updated 2000 estimates) that produced the revised DA estimates. Although these experts generally agreed with the methods used to calculate components of international migration, they had concerns about the assumptions regarding the undercount of international migrants. Specifically, they believed the undercount assumption of 15 percent for unauthorized migrants, which the Revised DA incorporated, was too high, especially given the March 2001 A.C.E. undercounts for other hard-to-enumerate groups. In addition, they urged renaming the residual migrant category as the residual foreign-born, or separating the residual foreign born into known components (""quasi-legal"" migrants) and the implied unauthorized migrant population. Subsequent sensitivity analysis incorporated both of these suggestions. The sensitivity analysis of assumptions about various components of the foreign-born population showed that the total number of foreign born did not vary enough to have much effect on the total population DA estimate. For example, the lower bound assumption of 3.3 percent net undercount of the foreign-born equated to a population of 281.3 million, or more than three million people lower than the March 2001 A.C.E. total population. The upper bound assumption of 6.7 percent was consistent with a 282.5 million population, which is still more than two million lower than the March 2001 A.C.E. total population. These results led the Census Bureau to conclude that the Revised DA was an appropriate benchmark for assessing Census 2000 and the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates. (ESCAP II, 2001.)  2.2 Measurement of Vital Events Other research examined the remaining assumptions underlying the DA components of change, including the birth, death, and Medicare components. Although death and the elderly population size estimates did not change much, this research changed the estimates of historical births by revising the assumptions about registration completeness of births since 1968. The previous DA estimates assumed a 99.2 percent (the 1968 level) registration of all births in years since 1968 (the last year of testing birth registration completeness). For the Revised DA estimates, registration completeness was assumed to gradually reach 100 percent by 1985 (the first year natality statistics were reported electronically from all the States), and remained at 100 percent -11-    through 2000. This revision lowered the estimated number of births for 1968-2000 by 715,000, which lowered the Revised DA estimate of the total population in 2000 by the same number. (Robinson, October 2001.)  2.3 Results of Revised DA The research undertaken between March and October allayed two fundamental concerns: (1) the Alternative DA did not capture the full growth of the population between 1990 and 2000, and (2) the 1990 DA was lower than the true population. The research effect on immigration, births, and deaths led to Revised DA estimates, produced in September 2001, which were slightly different from the Alternative DA. The inconsistency between the Alternative DA and the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates did not result from unexplained problems in DA. These results led the Census Bureau to conclude that the March 2001 A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's total population. The Revised DA lowered the estimated net undercount rates from 1.85 to 1.65 percent in 1990, and from 0.32 to 0.12 percent in 2000, but did not alter the DA finding that the estimated net undercount rate in 2000 was substantially lower than in 1990. (Robinson, October 2001.) The Revised DA continued to estimate a lower net undercount than the March 2001 A.C.E., and was very close to the Alternative DA estimate used in March. The Revised DA estimated a net undercount of 0.3 million, or 0.12 percent, compared with the March 2001 A.C.E. estimate of a net undercount of 3.3 million, or 1.15 percent. Population totals from the Base DA, Alternative DA, and Revised DA, along with the Census 2000 counts and the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates, are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Resident Population Totals from Census 2000, Demographic Analysis, and the March 2001 A.C.E.: April 1, 2000 Source Total Population Base DA 279,598,121 Census 2000 281,421,906 Revised DA (Revised Registration Completeness Assumption) 281,759,858 Alternative DA (Double Unauthorized Immigration) 282,335,711 March 2001 A.C.E.* 284,683,782 * This estimate is considered to be unacceptable and was subsequently revised as explained in U.S. Bureau of the Census (2003). As shown in Table 3 (see Appendix A for a note regarding inconsistencies in race classifications between DA, the 2000 A.C.E., and the 1990 PES), the Revised DA implied a greater reduction than the March 2001 A.C.E. in estimated net undercount in Census 2000 compared with the 1990 census. The revised DA reduced the estimated net undercount rate by 1.53 percentage points, from 1.65 percent in 1990 to 0.12 percent in 2000. In contrast, the March 2001 A.C.E. estimate of 1.15 percent net undercount in 2000 was 0.43 percentage points lower than the 1.58 percent estimate in the 1990 PES. Additionally, both DA and the March 2001 A.C.E. estimated a reduction in the net undercount rates of Black and NonBlack children compared with 1990. Both -12-    methods also estimated a reduction in the net undercount rates of adult Black men and women. The revised DA and March 2001 A.C.E. estimates continued to disagree. The DA found a reduction in the estimated net undercount rates of NonBlack men and women in Census 2000 compared with the rates of previous censuses. The March 2001 A.C.E. indicated no change or a slight increase in estimated undercount rates for NonBlack adults as a group.

The base of the DA percent is the total  population, while the base of the A.C.E. percent is the household population, which  excludes group quarters.  Demographic analysis provided evidence that correlation bias8 was not reduced between 1990 and 2000. Comparisons of the DA and March 2001 A.C.E. sex ratios (men per 100 women) showed that correlation bias in the survey estimates was not reduced for Black men between 1990 and 2000. The March 2001 A.C.E. sex ratios for Black adults were much lower than the expected sex ratios based on DA, implying that the March 2001 A.C.E. did not capture the high undercount rate of Black men relative to Black women. The size of this bias was about the same  Correlation bias refers to the tendency for census enumerated people to be more likely included in the A.C.E. than people missed in the census.

Adult females are assumed to have no correlation bias. -13-  8   as in the 1990 coverage measurement survey. (ESCAP II, 2001.) The DA estimates do have a few limitations. First, the major DA estimates are available only at the national level and only for two broad race categories: Black and Nonblack (All Other Races Combined). Another concern regarding DA estimates is the uncertainty of the measured undercounts. The aggregate administrative data and estimates used to construct the DA benchmarks are corrected for various types of errors. There are assumptions in this estimation process, some of which can be validated and some of which are based on quite limited information. Third, the race categories in the DA estimates largely reflect the race assigned in the particular administrative record at the time of the event (birth, death, or enrollment in Medicare). The DA estimates of net undercount are biased to the extent that people who are classified as a particular race in DA (e.g., Black) reported a different race in the A.C.E. Fourth, the DA covers the total population while the A.C.E. is limited to the household population. The difference in the universe is the group quarters (GQ) population. The GQ population is included in the DA estimates, and cannot be separated, but the GQ population is excluded from the A.C.E. universe. (Robinson, October 2001). The Census Bureau should continue to use DA as a coverage evaluation tool. For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau should also investigate ways to measure uncertainty in the DA estimates of undercount and to expand DA estimate to more race/ethnicity groups.  3. March 2001 A.C.E.: Person Coverage We begin the examination of person coverage by summarizing recommendations for sampling and estimation and evaluation studies and recommendations for person interviewing. We follow this with summarizations of basic results or evaluations for specific error sources: erroneous enumerations, census omissions, balancing, correlation, conditioning, reinstated late additions, and Census 2000 imputations. For each error source, we also provide recommendations for future consideration.  3.1 Sampling and Estimation ""In January 1999, the Supreme Court ruled against the use of sampling for congressional apportionment. (Department of Commerce v. House of Representatives, 525 U.S. 316, 119 S. Ct. 765 (1999).)"" (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.) This changed the Census Bureau's plans for the coverage measurement survey. The A.C.E., a subsample of the Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM) survey, replaced the ICM. The ICM would have produced estimates of the population for each state directly from the state sample with sufficient reliability for apportionment. ""The A.C.E. was a quality check to evaluate the census coverage and possibly correct for net coverage, but could not be used for apportionment."" (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.) The timing of the decision against sampling for apportionment impacted sampling and estimation -14-    in three key ways.  C  The Census Bureau did not have time to redesign the A.C.E. sample to meet the production schedule, so the Census Bureau designed the A.C.E. sample based on the ICM using a double sampling9 approach. The multi-phase sampling meant that the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal variance estimation procedures had to be discarded and new procedures researched and developed. The state-based post-stratification plan had to be discarded and a national post-stratification researched and developed. (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.)  C C  Below is a summary of assessments of the major A.C.E. sampling (U.S. Census Bureau, October  2002) and estimation steps in Census 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002) and  suggestions for the future. These assessments were obtained by the Decennial Management  Division through discussions with key professional staff involved in sampling and estimation  planning and implementation. Except for the missing data compensation step, no formal  evaluations were conducted.  The major sampling and estimation steps for the 2000 A.C.E. are:   C C C C C C  Sampling  Weight trimming  Missing data compensation  Dual system estimation  Synthetic estimation  Variance estimation.   3.1.1 Sampling The P sample contained approximately 300,000 housing units in the 50 states (excluding areas of remote Alaska) and the District of Columbia. For planning the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau should consider the following recommendations:  C  Explore the pros and cons of a double sampling approach from the perspective of estimation and field concerns. Consider if the Census Bureau should develop a design allowing the flexibility to apply either a state or national design in anticipation of the possible need to change designs as was done in Census 2000.  9  Double sampling refers to the subselection of the final sample from a preselected larger sample. -15-   C  Do additional analysis to obtain better measures of size of census blocks, critical information for the sample design. Improved measures of size makes possible better control of workloads, weights, and variances. Use the blocks, efficien Census Census 2000 method or a similarly defined method for sampling small census those with zero to two housing units. This results in variance estimation cies and reduces the effect the small block clusters have on the estimates. (U.S. Bureau, October 2002.)  C  3.1.2 Weight Trimming The Census Bureau designed A.C.E. weight trimming to reduce sampling weights for clusters that would have an extreme influence on the dual system estimates and variances. They trimmed the weight for one cluster. (Mule, American Statistical Association, 2001.) For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau should consider these recommendations:  C  Build a threshold standard into the weight trimming procedure. If the total weight to be trimmed or the change in the mean square error by doing the trimming are below a given threshold, then the weight trimming would not be implemented. Control weights at the post-stratum level rather than at the cluster level. In Census 2000, only one cluster needed trimming. However, at the post-stratum level, a post-stratum had several clusters with high weights. Schedule weight trimming during dual system estimation instead of before missing data processing to allow the Census Bureau to take into account the effect of weight trimming on the Dual System Estimates. (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.)  C  C  3.1.3 Missing Data Missing data occurred in the A.C.E. if, after all followup attempts, there remained households  not interviewed or households with portions of the person data missing, such as age or race.  Sometimes the missing item might have been the status of whether a person matched, was a  resident on Census Day, or was correctly enumerated. The Census Bureau used statistical  models to account for missing data. As shown below, the level and pattern of missing data in the  March 2001 A.C.E. was comparable to that of the 1990 PES. The effect of the missing data on  the overall March 2001 A.C.E. quality was similar to that experienced by the 1990 PES and  documented in the P studies. ( Mack et. al., 1991; Gbur, 1991; West, 1991.)  Additional statistical models to account for missing data were developed to assess the effect on  the estimates of using alternative models. (Keathley, Kearney, and Bell, 2001.)  Imputed demographic characteristics used to account for missing post-stratification variables  -16-    result in increased classification correlation bias. High levels of status10, also increase variance. data increases variance because component.  error as well as synthetic error and possibly contribute to missing data, particularly for match, residence, or enumeration The Census Bureau did not evaluate how this type of missing the measure of sampling variance largely picked up this  Two important changes for the Census 2000 could have affected missing data rates. First, the level of missing data in the A.C.E. interview could have been higher because of a change in how the Census Bureau treated movers. In 1990, the Census Bureau only needed to interview the current residents, whereas in Census 2000, interviewers needed information about the current (A.C.E. Interview Day) residents and the Census Day residents. On the other hand, the A.C.E. eliminated the need to geographically code the Census Day address of inmovers, thus eliminating one potential source of missing data. Second, the Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instrument kept the interviewer on the correct set of questions and allowed for tight managerial control. The March 2001 A.C.E. missing person demographic characteristics imputation programs operated nearly identically to those used for the 1990 Census PES. (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.) The March 2001 A.C.E. used a different statistical model to account for missing data for match and residence status than the 1990 PES. The Census Bureau based the 1990 model on hierarchical logistic regression, while the 2000 model used the ""Imputation Cell Estimator.""11 The input data and behavioral assumptions between the two models were similar but not identical. The amount of missing data in the March 2001 A.C.E. was low. This low level minimizes the effect of the missing data assumptions on the final estimates. The Census Bureau found:  C  March 2001 A.C.E. had high interview rates. Among occupied housing units, the Census Bureau had a 97.1 percent interview rate for Census Day and 98.8 percent for A.C.E. Interview Day. This compares to 98.4 percent (unweighted) in the 1990 PES. Because of the high response, most of the changes due to the noninterview adjustment factors applied were very small. This result helps keep down the variance of survey weights.  Missing match, residence, or enumeration status are referred to below as unresolved match, residence, or enumeration status. Sometimes we also refer to them as unresolved person status. The imputation cell estimator separated people with resolved and unresolved match or correct enumeration status into groups called imputation cells based on operational demographic characteristics. Within each imputation cell, the weighted proportion of residents or correct enumerations among the cases with resolved status was calculated value imputed for all unresolved people in the cell. (Cantwell et. al, 2001.) -1711  10  or resident and matches or , and that   C  A low proportion, 2.2 percent, of people had unresolved residence. The missing data procedures assigned an average resident probability of 82.6 percent to people with unresolved resident status. As designed, this was lower than the average rate among people with resolved status (98.2 percent). Only 1.2 percent of the sample had unresolved match status, compared to 1.8 percent in the 1990 PES. The Census Bureau assigned an average match rate of 84.3 percent to people with unresolved match status, compared to 91.7 percent for those with resolved status. The low rate of unresolved match status implies only a small effect on the estimation. About 2.6 percent of the E sample had unresolved enumeration status compared to 2.3 percent in the 1990 PES. The average rate of correct enumeration for people with unresolved status was 76.2 percent compared to 95.9 percent for those with resolved status. (Cantwell et. al., 2001.) Similar to the 1990 PES, March 2001 A.C.E. had low rates of missing demographic data as shown in Table 4. There were few problems gathering answers to all questions about respondents in A.C.E. interviews for the P sample or from census forms for the E sample. This suggests that the post-stratification results accurately reflected respondents' true characteristics, and should help to reduce heterogeneity (i.e. the possibility for different people within post-strata to have different chances of being counted in the census and in the A.C.E.), since imputation determines the post-strata for only a small number of people. (Farber, 2001.)  C  C  C  Table 4: March 2001 A.C.E. and 1990 PES Missing Data Rates (weighted) Missing Characteristic March 2001 A.C.E. P sample Ra ce Hispanic Origin Ag e Sex Tenure 1 .4 2 .3 2 .4 1 .7 1 .9 E sample 3 .2 3 .4 2 .9 0 .2 3 .6 P sample 2 .5 Not Available 0 .7 0 .5 2 .3 1990 PES E sample 1 1 .8 Not Available 2 .4 1 .0 2 .5  While the missing data rates were low and the actual missing data treatments the Census Bureau used for the A.C.E. had small impacts on the estimates, the treatment of missing data can have a large effect on the A.C.E. estimates under certain assumptions. The Census Bureau considered, in various combinations, seven basic methods for addressing the noninterview and unresolved person status components of missing data in the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates. The Census Bureau used each resulting alternative model to compute new DSEs. The alternatives considered showed the choice of statistical model to account for missing data can have a substantial effect on the resulting estimates of coverage error, causing the DSEs to be over or understated. The -18-    Census Bureau chose to represent the effects of these alternative models in the form of increased uncertainty in the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates. The Census Bureau used the DSEs resulting from the alternative models to calculate a measure of variation similar to a sampling error. This evaluation found large non-sampling variability from the use of alternative missing data models. At the national level, the evaluation found the overall magnitude of the variation resulting from all combinations of the alternative statistical models used to account for missing data to be about 530,000. Arguments can be made that this measure understates the actual levels of variation due to missing data because it assumes each alternative was equally likely. (Spencer et. al, 2002.) The Census 2000 unresolved enumeration status rates were slightly higher than those in 1990, but were not viewed as high enough to cause major concern. (Liu, Jones, and Feldpausch, 2001.) The alternative model analysis indicated that missing data had a larger effect than anticipated. This could have been due to changes in the methods for incorporating movers into the DSE, or to a more diverse set of alternative models than used in evaluation of the 1990 missing data procedures. (Mack et. al., 1991.) For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau should consider the following:  C  If the Census noninterview noninterview minimize pro with missing  Bureau expects low noninterview rates in 2010, then use the A.C.E. 2000 adjustment methodology. If not, then investigate and consider alternatives for adjustment. If the Census Bureau takes the suggestion in Section 3.2 to xy interviews, examine the relative trade off between dealing with proxies and data.  C C C  Write the A.C.E. characteristic imputation program from scratch rather then baseing it on a previously written program which was not well understood. Impute missing characteristics using the same methodology implemented for the census, especially for the E sample to increase consistency of demographic characteristics. Link the P- and E-sample files for each block cluster and use the available information for matched units for characteristic imputation, especially if the P-sample persons are missing the characteristics. When people match, consider using the census information to impute for those missing characteristics to reduce inconsistencies between the two samples. Design a flexible imputation plan so that prior to imputing, the Census Bureau can examine the data and determine an optimal imputation. For missing age, impute an age (a number), rather than an age category. Imputing a number rather than a category provides more flexibility for estimation and later evaluations.  C C  -19-    C C C C  While for missing tenure, race, and Hispanic origin, the nearest-neighbor hot deck appears to work well, evaluate if alternatives could provide improvements. Model alternatives for sex imputation to see if improvements are possible. For the P sample, determine the probabilities of resident status and match status jointly. This helps account for the dependence between the two. When gathering information to be used to assign probabilities for unresolved person status, concentrate on information pertaining to the interview operations and field procedures (i.e. what went on), and less on demographic information (i.e. race, ethnicity, tenure, etc.). In Census 2000, the former information better classified cases for the purposes of assigning probabilities. Evaluate alternatives such as logistic regression and related software to assign probabilities for unresolved person status, but be careful not to over-model. (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.) There is the potential to improve probability estimates, but also the potential to increase variability. Use consistent coding and editing for race and other post-stratification variables in A.C.E. and census to increase consistency.  C  C  3.1.4 Dual System Estimation Dual system estimation measured the degree of population net coverage error observed during the census enumeration. It accomplished this by comparing the census enumeration results to A.C.E. results to calculate dual system estimates separately by post-strata based on geography and demographic variables. Populations not included in dual system estimation were Group Quarters persons, Service-Based Enumeration persons, and persons in Remote Alaska. The Census Bureau developed post-strata in reference to experience in all previous censuses, but especially the censuses of 1980 and 1990. In those censuses, since the net undercount was significantly larger than zero, they believed gross omissions was the dominant error, with gross erroneous inclusions being smaller. The Census Bureau also concluded that the determinants of net undercount would primarily follow socio-economic groupings. The factors that caused erroneous inclusions probably drive the differential errors by demographic group and geographic area as much as those that caused omissions. The Census Bureau considered poststratifying separately for omissions (P sample) and erroneous enumerations (E sample). The Census Bureau rejected this approach because of the tight schedule. (Hogan, 2002.)  -20-    For 2010 post-stratification planning, the Census Bureau should consider these recommendations:  C C C  Post-stratify the P and E samples separately to better account for both omissions and erroneous inclusions. (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.) Identify post-strata that better account for variability of socioeconomic groupings. Use generalized DSEs instead of postratification. This approach uses logistic regression to estimate probabilities of inclusion in the census and of correct enumerations. Post-stratification makes use of estimation cells which must be of sufficient size. Generalized DSEs are not limited by size constraints and thus offer greater opportunity to reduce biases.  For 2010 DSE implementation planning, the Census Bureau should consider the following recommendations:  C  Consider using ""Procedure B"" to handle movers. In 2000 the Census Bureau used ""Procedure C"" with a few exceptions where we used ""Procedure A"". ""Procedure C"" and ""Procedure A"" match the nonmovers and outmovers at the Census Day address and within the search area. ""Procedure C"" and ""Procedure A"" rather than ""Procedure B"" were used in 2000 because it is easier to match within the search area. One problem with ""Procedure C"" and ""Procedure A"" was that interviews with whole households of outmovers were proxy interviews. ""Procedure B"" was used in 1990. For this procedure, the nonmovers were matched to the Census Day address and search area. The inmovers were matched to their Census Day address requiring collecting the Census Day address for the inmover, obtaining the census geography for the address, and matching to that address and surrounding blocks. This inmover matching was time consuming because the census questionnaires were printed from microfilm for clerical matching. The entire mover matching process could be improved in 2010 since names are captured for the entire country. Develop improved methods to detect erroneous enumerations and to incorporate duplicates into the coverage measurement survey estimates. (See Section 3.3, Erroneous Enumerations, Including Duplicates.) Use external data sources (e.g. administrative records, Demographic Analysis, American Community Survey) to improve coverage estimates. Include group quarters in future coverage measurement surveys to improve undercount estimates. (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.)  C  C C  -21-    3.1.5 Synthetic Estimation The last operation in the March 2001 A.C.E. estimation process, synthetic estimation, provided  population estimates for small geographic areas such as blocks, tracts, counties, and  congressional districts. The Census Bureau formed these small area estimates by applying  coverage correction factors (i.e. the ratio of the DSE to the census count for each postratum) to  the census counts at the different geographic levels. For example, the Census Bureau formed a  block-level synthetic estimate by distributing a post-stratum's dual system estimate to blocks  proportional to the size of the post-stratum's population within the block. For use in all census  data products, the Census Bureau constructed rounded, adjusted synthetic estimates at the  tabulation block level12. Data users then produce population estimates for any geographic area of  interest by aggregating blocks. Populations not included in synthetic estimation were Group  Quarters persons, Service-Based Enumeration persons, and persons in Remote Alaska.  For Census 2010, the Census Bureau may want to consider a modeling approach to DSEs. In this  case, the Census Bureau would not need a separate synthetic estimation procedure.  (U.S. Census Bureau, December 2002.)   3.1.6 Variance Estimation The Census Bureau expected the sampling variances and coefficients of variation (CV) to be lower for the March 2001 A.C.E. compared to the 1990 PES because:  C C C  The housing unit sample size for the A.C.E. was almost double that of the PES (approximately 300,000 versus approximately 165,000). Better measures of population size were available during sample selection of clusters. Sampling weights were less variable.  As expected, the improvements led to much smaller sampling variances. The actual reduction was larger than the 25 percent expected reduction due to the increase in sample size. This is seen from Table 5. Also:  C C C  The CVs declined for forty-seven states, with an average reduction of 36.8 percent. At the Congressional District level, the median CV decreased by about 40 percent, from 0.499 percent to 0.297 percent. The median CV decreased by roughly 50 percent, from 0.629 percent to 0.314 percent, for places with a census population greater than 100,000.  Data is collected for blocks usually defined by physical features. After the Census is completed, blocks are split by other boundaries, such as political boundaries, to create new blocks. Data is tabulated based on the new block definitions. -22-  12   C  The median CV decreased by about 40 percent, from 0.510 percent to 0.310 percent, for counties with a census population greater than 100,000.

Unlike the PES, the March 2001 A.C.E. replicate variances of the  census estimates had three components:   C C C  Variance due to the multi-phase sampling of block clusters for the A.C.E.  Variance due to sampling for the Targeted Extended Search.  Variance from estimating the missing data in A.C.E.   The variance computation accounted for some of the components of variance due to missing  data, but it is unknown whether it largely accounted for the variance due to missing data since the  computation did not include the variance component due to the selection of statistical model to  account for missing data. The alternative models evaluation conducted by Keathley, Kearney,  and Bell (2001) indicated this component may be large.  Synthetic error is not incorporated into the A.C.E. variance estimates. The assumption is that the coverage rate is uniform over all areas within post-strata. Synthetic error is introduced to the extent the areas deviate from this assumption. The accuracy of this methodology may decrease in areas where localized effects not reflected in the post-stratification affect the true sampling variance. The discrepancy becomes larger as the population of an area decreases. Thus, caution should be used in comparisons between areas of different sizes. (Starsinic et. al., 2001.) -2313   The Census Bureau should consider whether the use of complex variance methods would be more beneficial in production or in an evaluation of the production variances. They should also consider developing confidence measures for A.C.E. that reflect synthetic error and other nonsampling error as well as sampling error.  3.2 A.C.E. Person Interviewing Byrne, Imel, Ramos, and Stallone (2001) examined the A.C.E. person interview operation. The  interviewing operation had two phases: telephone and personal visit. The personal visit also  used a NonResponse Conversion Operation (NRCO) to try converting the noninterviews by using  the best interviewers.  Dates of the operation:   C C C  Telephone Phase Personal Visit Phase Nonresponse Conversion  April 24, 2000-June 13, 2000  June 19, 2000-September 11, 2000  July 27, 2000-September 11, 2000   The A.C.E. planned all interview activities to end on September 1, 2000. However, one local  census office, Hialeah, Florida required more time to complete the census data collection  operations. This resulted in a delay for the subsequent A.C.E. person interviewing in Hialeah  until August 18, 2000-September 11, 2000. All other offices finished interviewing on schedule,  September 1, 2000.  The 2000 A.C.E. did not use a paper form as used in the 1990 PES. The Census Bureau used  computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) software.  Byrne, Imel, Ramos, and Stallone (2001) provide results of the interviewing operation:   C  Almost all (99.9 percent) interviews resulted in a satisfactory outcome. The Census Bureau classified only 0.12 percent of all interviews as either refusal, language barrier, or no knowledgeable respondent noninterviews. The Census Bureau completed 29 percent of the total A.C.E. workload during the telephone phase. As a result, the interview phase ended with much less time transpiring between Census Day and the day of the interview, potentially reducing recall bias. The Census Bureau classified over 99 percent of the telephone cases as complete or partial interviews conducted with a household member. The Census Bureau classified 84 percent of the personal visit interviews as either complete or partial interviews and found 14 percent to be vacant on Interview Day. This accounts for  C  C  -24-    98 percent of the personal visit workload. Of the remaining 2 percent, 1.9 percent were nonexistent units on Interview Day and 0.2 percent were noninterviews.  C  Interviewers converted personal visit phases to remaining cases, 11.4 p Only 2.2 percent of the  70.8 percent of the cases sent for NRCO from the telephone and complete interviews and 14.1 percent to partial interviews. Of the ercent converted to vacant units and 1.5 percent to nonexistent units. NRCO cases finished as refusals.  C  Automating the interviewing enhanced the quality of data captured in the interviews, expedited the turnaround time for reassigning interviews and providing feedback to the interviewers, and instilled the interviewers with a sense of professionalism and purpose. The Quality Assurance (QA) operation helped keep the rate of error low and indicated a high level of data quality.  C  The QA of person interviewing helped ensure correct results from the telephone and personal visit phases of the operation. The QA sample was from two sources: a five percent random sample of the total caseload and targeted cases selected by the QA supervisors because they were likely to contain inaccurate information or insufficient data quality. Only 190 cases failed the QA. For all such cases, the Census Bureau obtained and used a replacement interview in the survey. The Census Bureau effectively weeded out several interviewers whose work had egregious errors. The Census Bureau accomplished more by targeting for problematic cases than through randomly sampling cases. The low failure rate in the random sample meant the errors in person interviewing were under control. Highlights of the QA results:  C  The overall failure rate for the targeted cases (0.85 percent) was dramatically different from the randomly selected cases (0.13 percent). This pattern held for both telephone and personal visit interviews, suggesting targeting was effective in identifying cases likely to fail the quality assurance. Because of the data edits and automated skip patterns, as well as the quick turnaround time for cases to get assigned and completed in QA, automating both the original person interview and the QA reinterview enhanced the overall quality and efficiency of the person interview operation.  C  Wolfgang, Byrne, and Spratt (2003) examined the characteristics of people and households by respondent type (i.e., interview with a household or nonhousehold member). Among the original A.C.E. person interviews, the age group below 18 had the lowest percent interview with a nonhousehold member or proxy. The age group between 18 and 29 had the highest percent proxy in the person interview. The owners had a lower percent proxy than the non-owners. The race category containing Non-Hispanic Black had the highest percent proxy and all other race -25-    categories were not significantly different from each other. The people in multi-unit structures had a higher percent proxy than people in single unit structures. Single person households had a higher percent proxy interview than larger households. The people who did not match to the census had a larger percent proxy than people who matched. The Census Bureau sent P-sample people to followup because we were not absolutely certain about the information provided in the original interview, such as not matched people from proxy interviews, from conflicting households, and from households where some people matched. Among the followup interviews for the A.C.E., 25.6 percent were proxy interviews in the A.C.E. original interview and the Census Bureau got a household member as a respondent in followup for only 35.3 percent of the original proxy interviews. For followup interviews, the percent proxy for the P-sample people removed because they were not residents of the household or were fictitious was lower (15.4 percent) than for the P-sample people who were not removed (33.5 percent). Wolfgang et. al. examined characteristics of the matched people looking at the respondent type. When the 2000 A.C.E. responses for various characteristics did not agree with census responses, they found a higher percentage of proxy responses than when the responses agreed. These data raise issues about the data quality provided by non-household members. The percent of proxy respondents (5.5 percent) in the 2000 A.C.E. interview raises questions about the effect of proxy data on the undercount estimates. The 2010 coverage measurement program should minimize proxy interviews and only accept interviews from knowledgeable respondents.  3.3 Error Sources Three studies produced substantial information on error components associated with the P and E samples: the Matching Error Study (MES), the Evaluation Followup (EFU), and the Person Duplication Studies.  C Matching Error Study The Matching Error Study (Bean, 2001; Bean, 2002) provided the P-sample matching error rate and the E-sample processing error rate. Expert matchers clerically rematched all of the people in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. sample clusters to determine the match code. They then compared these codes to the match codes assigned to produce the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates.  C Evaluation Followup The EFU (Krejsa and Raglin, Report 3, 2001; Krejsa, 2001; Raglin and Krejsa, Report 16, 2001; Adams and Krejsa, 2001; Krejsa, 2003) consisted of a reinterview of a subsample of households in the one-fifth subsample of A.C.E. clusters used in the Matching Error Study. The Census Bureau used the EFU interview results to measure the E-sample classification -26-    accuracy of correct and erroneous census enumerations. They also used the results to measure the P-sample data accuracy regarding mover status and Census Day residence.  C Person Duplication Studies The Person Duplication Studies (Feldpausch, Report 6, 2001; Fay, 2002; Thompson, Waite, and Fay, 2001; Mule, Report 20, 2001) took advantage that Census 2000 recorded name information in the data capture system. For the first time, this new information permitted the Census Bureau to conduct nationwide computer matching to measure census duplication. These studies also examined how well the A.C.E. accounted for these duplicates. While the A.C.E. matched respondents in the same block and surrounding blocks, this new tool permitted the Census Bureau to search for duplicates throughout the country. Because the Census Bureau lacked resources to conduct both a computer and clerical match to the entire country, the Person Duplication Studies involved only computer matching. This resulted in an understatement of the actual duplication level. These studies compared the results of the EFU with the Person Duplication Studies to determine if the EFU correctly measured duplications. Some error components produced from the Matching Error Study, Evaluation Followup, and  Person Duplication Studies suggest the March 2001 A.C.E. overestimated the net undercount  while other studies suggest the net undercount was underestimated. The results from these and  other studies are discussed below as we examine:   C C C C C C C  Erroneous enumerations  Census omissions  Balancing error  Correlation bias  Conditioning  Reinstated late additions  Census 2000 imputations   3.3.1 Erroneous Enumerations, Including Duplicates Evaluations indicated that the March 2001 A.C.E. did not measure a substantial portion of the Census 2000 erroneous enumerations. The measurement of erroneous enumerations is critical to both the national net undercount and to sub-national estimates. This error resulted in the March 2001 A.C.E. overstating the net Census 2000 undercount by at least three million people, with a range of three to four million. (ESCAP II, 2001.) The EFU and Person Duplication Studies described above provided substantial information regarding the measurement of erroneous enumerations. The initial EFU results gave evidence of a significant understatement in the March 2001 A.C.E. measurement of erroneous enumerations. Because of the size of the understatement, the EFU was extensively reviewed. The revised EFU -27-    also indicated a problem with understating the erroneous enumerations. The revised EFU had a high level of unresolved14 or conflicting cases15. The Person Duplication Studies found a significant number of duplicate enumerations not measured by the March 2001 A.C.E. and that the EFU did not pick up significant portions of this error. The Person Duplication Studies resolved a portion of the cases left unresolved or conflicting by the EFU Review. Three and a half percent of the EFU sample changed enumeration status as recorded by the March 2001 A.C.E. The EFU re-coded about 2,800,000 estimated (SE 223,000) ""correct enumerations"" as ""erroneous enumerations"" and re-coded about 900,000 estimated (SE 99,000) ""erroneous enumerations,"" as ""correct enumerations"". (Krejsa and Raglin, Report 3, 2001.) The EFU found an estimated net difference of 1,900,000. Also, about 4,500,000 estimated (SE 353,000) cases in the EFU could not be resolved. This study showed the March 2001 A.C.E. overstated the net undercount by a minimum of about two million people. (ESCAP II, 2001.) For comparison, the 1990 evaluation study (West, 1991) of erroneous enumerations found the 1990 PES understated the net undercount by about 360,000 estimated persons. West also found about 1,273,000 estimated E-sample people could not be matched or were unresolved. (In 1990, the EFU was a reinterview using the 1990 Person Followup (PFU) form. In 2000, the EFU was designed to differ from the 2000 PFU form, including more residency probes.) Because of the EFU's implications for the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates, further EFU analysis was conducted. Better trained matching analysts from the National Processing Center (NPC) reviewed a subsample of the EFU and production cases. This review of the original EFU confirmed the errors in the March 2001 A.C.E.'s identification of erroneous enumerations. About 1,800,000 estimated (SE 189,000) enumerations coded as correct in production were then coded erroneous in the evaluation, while about 361,000 estimated (SE 46,000) enumerations coded as erroneous in production were then coded as correct in the review. (Adams and Krejsa, 2001.) Consequently, the net difference in the ""correct enumeration"" to ""erroneous enumeration"" and ""erroneous enumeration"" to ""correct enumeration"" cells was estimated to be 1,450,000, rather than the initial 1,900,000. However, the review identified over 15 million estimated cases which could not be resolved or had conflicting A.C.E. and EFU information. (Adams and Krejsa, 2001.) The coding of erroneous enumerations was conservative because the purpose of the review was to determine if the original coding designated too many erroneous enumerations. This created a large number of conflicting cases. Depending on assumptions regarding the enumeration status of these conflicting cases, the estimated overstatement of the net undercount could range from about 1.45 million to 5.9 million people. (ESCAP II, 2001.) The Person Duplication Studies found a significant number of duplicate enumerations were incorrectly measured in the March 2001 A.C.E. or in the EFU. Furthermore, upon combining the Person Duplication Studies results with the review of original EFU results, the Census Bureau Unresolved people are those for whom the Census Bureau did not have enough information to accurately code whether they should be counted as erroneous or correct enumerations. Conflicting people are these for whom the Census Bureau obtained different residency information in PFU and EFU and the Census Bureau could not determine which was correct. -2815 14   could explain some of the unresolved and conflicting cases. Based on this work, they developed more refined ranges for the March 2001 A.C.E. overstatement level. Direct estimates produced from the Person Duplication Studies indicated the March 2001 A.C.E. error not measured was about three million persons. In addition, the Census Bureau expected further refinements (Fay, 2002) to the treatment of the unresolved and conflicting cases would lead to about an additional 800,000 errors. Thus, they reduced the estimated net undercount overstatement range to three to four million persons. (ESCAP II, 2001.) Martin, Fay, and Krejsa (2002a; 2002b) conducted a preliminary evaluation of the A.C.E. Person Followup and EFU questionnaires to understand their success in identifying erroneous enumerations. They examined the consistency of residency reporting in the two surveys, and used duplication rates to assess the validity of the classifications produced by the two questionnaires. They examined responses to questionnaire items, and did not incorporate information from clerical coding of interviewer's notes which formed the basis of official estimates of Census 2000 coverage. The A.C.E. Person Followup questionnaire attempted to determine Census Day residence with only a few global questions; the EFU questionnaire asked a larger number of more detailed questions. Martin et. al.'s analysis indicated high levels of inconsistent reporting of moves in and out of households, second residences, and stays in group quarters. They found that identification of enumeration errors appears to have been greatly enhanced by taking into account information from both surveys, because each questionnaire added information about errors that were not identified by the other. Neither questionnaire could be said to represent a ""gold standard"" for reporting accuracy. (Martin, 2001.) They also found that the EFU identified small but significant numbers of erroneous enumerations among the matched cases, and these cases had high rates of duplication. Martin, Fay, and Krejsa (2002a; 2002b) and Martin (2001) identified the following as research related to erroneous enumerations identification needed for 2010:  C  Review residence rules and critical definitions to create a simpler classification scheme that relies on clearer definitions that can be understood by interviewers and respondents in the field. Devote resources to long term coverage measurement instrument improvements. Research and instrument development and testing are needed to address conceptual, recall, and comprehension issues affecting group quarters residence and multiple residence reporting. A further goal for research and development should be to reduce reliance on expensive, time consuming and labor-intensive clerical coding operations. Accurate classifications should be produced by the standardized questions in the instrument, reducing the need for intervention and interpretation by analysts and clerks. Develop a coverage measurement design that better integrates instruments for the A.C.E., followup surveys, and evaluations. Explore how to improve coverage measurement by maximizing the potential each data collection instrument offers. For example, it would be -29-   C  C   desirable for the PFU instrument to do more probing as was done by EFU. The EFU and PFU instruments might also be designed to identify census or A.C.E. omissions. The Census instruments might collect additional information to facilitate residence determinations. The EFU provided information regarding whether the March 2001 A.C.E. accurately identified Census 2000 discrepant enumerations.16 This study showed no problem with the identification of discrepant enumerations. (Krejsa, 2001.) Mule (Report 20, 2001) and Jones (Report 0.16, 2003) found higher duplication rates for certain subgroups and areas. Both found higher duplication rates among Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics compared to other race/ethnicity subgroups and among 18 to 29 year old males compared to other age/sex subgroups. Additionally, Jones found duplication more prevalent in small multiunit housing structures and mobile homes compared to other housing type subgroups, in the New York and Boston regional offices compared to other regional offices, among renters compared to owners, and among persons in duplicate housing units or in housing units added to the census inventory after 1990 compared to persons included in other ways. These findings suggest that it may be beneficial to target these subgroups and areas in conducting person duplicate searches. Finally, Feldpausch (2001) examined the relationship between the E-sample people identified as duplicates outside the search area and their corresponding March 2001 A.C.E. enumeration status. In past censuses, the Census Bureau had no way to evaluate the coding of people duplicated outside the post-enumeration survey's search area. For Census 2000, analyses preceding the Person Duplication Studies searched for duplicates throughout the country. Mule (Report 20, 2001) conducted computer matching to determine the extent of duplicate enumerations not found in the March 2001 A.C.E. This allowed him to evaluate the March 2001 A.C.E. coding of people duplicated outside the search area. A person enumerated twice by the census was duplicated. The record of a person enumerated in the correct place should have been coded as a correct enumeration. The record of a person enumerated in an incorrect place according to census residence rules should have been coded as an erroneous enumeration. Feldpausch found a lower than expected percentage erroneous enumeration for E-sample people duplicated to people in group quarters where the residents were not allowed to claim usual home elsewhere (45.5 percent for college dorms and 16.5 percent for other group quarters). This rate  Discrepant enumerations include falsification (the amount is uncertain), but do not include honest mistakes made by the interviewers or respondents. A person is classified as discrepant during the matching operation if three knowledgeable respondents indicate not knowing him or her in either the EFU or production interview. -30-  16   should have been closer to one hundred percent because for the majority of these people their usual residence was probably the group quarters. For those E-sample people duplicated to people in group quarters allowed to claim usual home elsewhere, Feldpausch found a higher than expected percentage erroneous enumeration (12.5 percent). The erroneous enumeration rate for these people should have been close to zero because the housing unit, not the group quarters, was probably their usual residence. The percentage erroneous enumeration for E-sample people duplicated to people in housing units outside the A.C.E. search area (14.2 percent) was lower than the approximate 50 percent one might have expected. One might expect 50 percent because half of the time the wrong housing unit should be in sample, resulting in coding the residents as erroneous. Some possible explanations of these findings are:  C  The instructions indicating who to include on the census questionnaire may not have been completely understood or were ignored by the respondent. Examples of living situations causing problems include college students, people in local jails, and people in nursing homes. The respondent may not have known a household member was enumerated elsewhere. Some group quarters' enumerations may have used administrative records not reflecting residents as of April 1, 2000. Residence in some group quarters is temporary, such as local jails. Some people counted in these may be usual residents of the sample housing unit. The computer matching of duplicates outside the search area might be incorrect. The Census Bureau does not think this was likely, because the Census Bureau only looked at those cases that had a high probability of being linked correctly. The March 2001 A.C.E. failed to completely identify erroneous enumerations due to other residence. The percent other residence was 1.4 in the March 2001 A.C.E. and 2.3 in the 1990 PES (these percentages reflect the redistribution of people with unresolved status). The results of the Evaluation Followup also measured this phenomenon. code some people as erroneous enumerations residences. Some people were identified as been counted at another address. In many of uld have been counted, making them  C C C C  C  Evidence suggests the March 2001 A.C.E. did not who should have been because they lived in other erroneous enumerations because they should have these cases they were also counted where they sho duplicates.  -31-    These studies show that the Census Bureau needs to conduct further research to better identify erroneous enumerations, including duplicates in the 2010 census. This research should investigate changes in residence rules, data collection procedures, coding procedures and instruments and improved estimation approaches. Further work by Martin, Fay, and Krejsa (2002a; 2002b) suggests that the Census Bureau consider sending a subsample of matched cases to followup during production because there may be undetected erroneous enumerations among them. Additional information about erroneous enumerations for Census 2000 may be found in Adams and Liu (2001); Bean (2001); Bean (2002); Feldpausch (2002); Liu, Jones, and Feldpausch (2001); Liu, Byrne, and Imel (2001); and Raglin and Krejsa (Report 16, 2001).  3.3.2 Census Omissions The Census Bureau used the P sample to measure census omissions. Therefore, matching of  P sample to the census, the classification of P-sample mover status and Census Day residence,  and the determination of P-sample discrepant enumerations were critical aspects of the P-sample  processing. The MES produced information about matching accuracy. The EFU provided  information about the accuracy of the classification of movers and Census Day residence and the  lack of discrepant enumerations.  In the A.C.E. clerical matching, clerks examined computerized P-sample responses and census  responses. They also had access to the scanned images of the original questionnaires. Because  of automation of the matching operation, all matching could be done at one location, instead of  seven as in 1990. (National Research Council, 2001.)  The Census Bureau conducted a Matching Error Study for the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal  Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM) and for the 1990 PES. The MES for the Census 2000  Dress Rehearsal was unable to measure significant matching error because of a 100 percent QA  during the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal ICM17. The match code discrepancy rates (which  represent the size difference between the person-level ICM and MES matching) for the P sample  were less than one percent in all sites.   For the Dress Rehearsal ICM, the Census Bureau planned to conduct QA on only a portion of the work, but logistical concerns necessitated a 100 percent QA. For the 2000 A.C.E., QA was done on a sample basis once the matcher reached a specified level of proficiency (periodically, the matching software reevaluated the decision to sample). The sample QA involved a dependent rematch on 1/6 of the clerks' (the lowest level of matchers) and 1/10 of the technicians' (the middle level of matchers) work. In addition, cases meeting special ""must do"" criteria were reviewed. (Byrne, 2001.) -32-  17   The 1990 MES found the PES generally tended to overestimate the P-sample nonmatches, especially when matching central city, minority persons. By evaluation poststratum (based on region, urbanicity, and minority status) the biases due to matching error ranged from approximately 0.7 percent to 1.3 percent of the population sizes. Of particular concern, the PES overestimated nonmatches for Blacks by about 4.5 percent which equated to an approximately 0.7 percent positive bias in the total Black population. (Davis and Biemer, #H-2, 1991.) Reductions in matching error from 1990 to 2000 provide evidence that changes made from 1990 improved the quality of the A.C.E. matching process. Even with these improvements, matching error from the P and E samples combined inflated the national dual system estimate by 483,938 with a standard error of 92,877 and therefore overstated the undercount estimate (holding all other errors constant). (Bean, 2001; Bean 2002.) To further reduce matching error in the future, planners should continue efforts to improve the matching process. Improvements to the matching process may be made by:  C C C  simplifying the targeted extended search (TES) matching procedures and improving the quality control for the TES clusters; identifying ways to further ensure that matchers update cases with insufficient information for matching; and clearly defining rules for coding cases as discrepant or unresolved. (Bean, 2002.)  The EFU showed that misclassification of movers in the March 2001 A.C.E. may have resulted in an estimated understatement of about 450,000 in the net undercount. (Raglin and Krejsa, Report 16, 2001.) This final effect results from significant changes in mover status. These changes involved a large number of movers becoming nonmovers and vice versa. The EFU estimated that about 4.5 million people classified as ""movers"" in production became EFU ""nonmovers,"" and about 2.4 million people classified as ""nonmovers"" in production became EFU ""movers."" At the national level there is a small estimated net effect of about 65,000 on the accuracy of the measurement of census omissions. The Census Bureau was concerned about the EFU measurement of movers who became nonmovers, specifically about whether the EFU measured too few movers, due to its questionnaire design. The EFU required less detailed information for classifying a person a nonmover than for classifying a person a mover. An examination of the bias caused by mover status changes indicated the effect of mover-to-nonmover changes was greater in absolute value than the effect of nonmover-to-mover changes. Even though the net effects of these errors cancel at the national level, assessment of the subnational effects requires further research. Martin, Fay, and Krejsa (2002a; 2002b) examined the EFU questionnaire in regard to mover identification. Results indicated high levels of unreliability in measurement of movers in and out of households. Research and instrument development testing are needed to address issues affecting the reporting of moves.  -33-    The EFU also demonstrated that A.C.E. did not have a large problem with discrepant enumerations. The EFU identified a weighted net 326,855 P-sample residents who should have been removed because they were discrepant. Up to 23,879 weighted people were excluded as P-sample residents, but identified as potentially discrepant by the EFU. (Krejsa, 2003.) The MES and EFU studies suggest the Census Bureau should continue efforts to improve the matching process and conduct research to improve the reporting of movers for 2010. Additional information about census omissions and movers for Census 2000 may be found in Liu, Jones, and Feldpausch (2001); Liu, Byrne, and Imel (2001); and Wolfgang, Adams, Davis, Liu, and Stallone (2001).  3.3.3 Balancing Error Balancing error may occur if the search areas for matches to the surrounding blocks do not equal search areas for correct enumerations in the surrounding blocks, the Census Bureau coded the data inconsistently, or the Census Bureau introduced P-sample geocoding error. Since the A.C.E. used a random sample independent from the census, the Census Bureau expected census housing units should be erroneously included within A.C.E. sample clusters as often as census housing units should be erroneously excluded from A.C.E. sample clusters. After adjusting for the P-sample coverage, if the problems above occurred, the weighted number of matches to surrounding blocks may not have equaled the weighted number of correct enumerations, creating balancing error. (Adams and Liu, 2001.) The A.C.E. carried out matching in a defined search area consisting of the A.C.E. sample blocks (clusters) and a targeted area of blocks surrounding or bordering the A.C.E. blocks (i.e. Targeted Extended Search Area). The March 2001 A.C.E. found three million more matches in surrounding blocks than correct enumerations, indicating balancing error as a potential problem. This could have affected the accuracy of the estimates. The Census Bureau identified various scenarios that could explain the differences. Also, the Census Bureau conducted evaluations to investigate the source of this difference, identify the scale of any error, and assess whether its magnitude could significantly affect the accuracy of adjusted data. The evaluation attributed most of the three million difference to the A.C.E. listing housing units in the blocks surrounding the sample blocks. This had little, if any, effect on the DSE. However, the evaluations detected about 246,000 additional A.C.E. people (SE 82,000) located out of the surrounding blocks due to P- sample geocoding errors. (Adams and Liu, 2001.) The evaluations also estimated an additional 195,000 people (SE 56,000) incorrectly identified as having been correctly enumerated, although found outside of the search area. These errors resulted in an overstatement of the net undercount by about 450,000 persons. The EFU and MES results included portions of these errors. While additional work is required to resolve the potential effects of balancing error, the Census Bureau believes that most of the concerns regarding balancing error have been addressed. -34-    The relationships between variables used in defining post-strata for dual system estimation and variables relevant to sampling of Targeted Extended Search cases revealed no concern with geocoding error or insight for improving geocoding error. (Wolfgang, Stallone, and Adams, 2002.)  3.3.4 Correlation Bias Correlation bias refers to the tendency for census enumerated people to more likely be included in the A.C.E. than people missed by the census. It can result from causal dependence, which occurs when the act of being included in the census makes some people more likely or less likely to be included in the A.C.E. Correlation bias can also result from heterogeneity bias, which arises when different people within poststrata have different chances of being included in the census and also different chances of being included in the A.C.E. To cause this type of bias, these chances of inclusion must be correlated, as when those likely to be missed by the census are also more likely to be missed by the A.C.E. This type of heterogeneity would result in a downward bias in the DSEs. In March 2001, the Census Bureau assessed possible correlation bias in the A.C.E. estimates by comparing the A.C.E. and DA results (Bell, B-12*, 2001). These correlation bias estimates used DA estimates as of February 26, 2001. The correlation bias estimates were recomputed in October 2001 to use the Revised DA estimates (Bell, Report 10, 2001). Although there is evidence of and reason to expect some correlation bias in dual system estimates, the Census Bureau did not correct for it in DSEs produced up to March 2001. For the 1990 PES there was concern about the newness of the methodology for estimating correlation bias and about the time required to fit a correlation bias adjustment into the production schedule. There was also concern that alternative models for correlation bias could be used that provided the same fit to the data but yielded different subnational estimates. This latter concern was also present for the 2000 A.C.E., leading to the decision made in the planning stages not to adjust those estimates for correlation bias. Another part of the thinking behind this decision was the that, in the presence of census undercounts, DSEs without adjustment for correlation bias are conservative in that they move the estimates in the right direction, though perhaps not fully correcting for net undercoverage. This thinking tied in with concerns that adjustment for correlation bias could overshoot the truth, at least for some population groups, a justifiable concern if other biases in the DSEs are positive tending to make them overestimates (as was the case with the March 2001 A.C.E. estimates). A.C.E. Revision II faced a different situation, however, because (i) it corrected its DSEs for other biases (such as the underestimation of erroneous enumerations due to duplication), and (ii) there was evidence of some net overcounts and some smaller undercounts for various groups in the 2000 census. In this situation DSEs without adjustment for correlation bias were not seen as conservative, as they could estimate overcounts for groups that were truly undercounted, and thus move estimates further from, not closer to, the truth. Because of this, the treatment of correlation bias was reconsidered and A.C.E. Revision II did correct its estimates for correlation bias. For the 2010 census, the Census Bureau should re-evaluate whether to adjust for correlation bias. -35-    3.3.5 Conditioning Conditioning, or contamination bias, refers to the situation where the A.C.E. influenced the census. As in the 1990 Census, contamination bias was not a problem in Census 2000, as research did not identify any strong evidence of its presence. Therefore, procedures to avoid contamination bias appear to work. (Bench, 2001; Bench 2002.)  3.3.6 Late Additions The Census Bureau made substantially more late additions than in the 1990 census. Late additions refer to persons included in the final census count who were excluded from A.C.E. matching and dual system estimation because of their late inclusion. For Census 2000, the late additions consisted exclusively of housing units temporarily removed from the census because the Census Bureau suspected they duplicated other housing units, but which they later reinstated into the final census after further research. The housing units were reinstated after the A.C.E. matching process started (i.e. the matching process did not influence the decision of what to reinstate). If the reinstated people were a small percentage of the census, or if their A.C.E. coverage rate was similar to the A.C.E. coverage rate for census people included in the A.C.E., then there would be minimal effect on the DSEs. (Hogan, Q-43, 2001.) The Census Bureau validated this assumption by clerically matching the reinstated people collected in A.C.E. and census in evaluation clusters (a 1/5th sample of A.C.E. clusters), attempting to mimic as best as possible what would have happened had they been among the census people in the production matching operations. (Raglin, 2001.) Based on this additional work, the Census Bureau concluded that excluding reinstated census people from the A.C.E. had little effect on the DSE. The March 2001 A.C.E. coverage rate may have been overestimated by 0.034 to 0.082 percentage points. (Raglin, 2001.)  3.3.7 Census Imputations Census 2000 experienced a higher rate of whole person imputations than the 1990 census. The Census Bureau excluded whole person imputations from A.C.E. matching activities, but reflected them in the census coverage error as measured by the A.C.E. The Census Bureau examined whether Census 2000 design features explained the whole person imputations (and thus should have no discernible impact on the A.C.E.), concluding that the kind, level, and pattern of whole person imputations in Census 2000 raised no issues relative to the accuracy of the March 2001 A.C.E. adjustment. (ESCAP II, 2001.)  -36-    Approximately 5.77 million persons had all their characteristics (short form data items18) imputed in Census 2000, compared to 1.97 million persons in the 1990 census. The Census Bureau added approximately 1.2 million of these persons to the census count through a count imputation process. The Census Bureau counted the remaining 4.6 million persons directly through the census enumeration process, but imputed all their person characteristics because information about them was substantially missing from the census records. (Nash, 2001.) Research into the sources of the whole person imputations identified changes in the way data were collected for large households as contributing to the level of housing units requiring imputation. Furthermore, the count imputation rate was comparable to the rate experienced in the 1970 and 1980 censuses. (ESCAP II, 2001.) The Census Bureau also examined characteristics of the imputed persons. It found similar distributions between the age, race and sex characteristics of the population requiring some form of imputation and the data-defined19 population with the exception of the age category under 18. The high proportion of younger people in the within household category caused the relatively higher percent of the population under 18 in the imputed population. This reflected the fact that large households (greater than six) likely have children not able to be accommodated by the six-person mail-return form, which would require imputation if their characteristics were not collected in the coverage edit followup. (Wetrogan and Cresce, 2001.) For the 2010 census, the Census Bureau should identify ways to reduce whole person imputations.  4. A.C.E.: Housing Coverage The Census Bureau conducted studies to examine housing unit coverage. These studies looked at the net undercount as well as the P-sample nonmatches and E-sample erroneous enumerations for housing units. They examined types of erroneous enumerations, including the housing unit duplication for Census 2000. Another study examined conflicting households, which are matched housing units with different people in the P sample and the E sample. The census flagged approximately 2.4 million housing units as potential duplicates, which A.C.E. processing excluded. (Nash, Memorandum 78, 2000.) The Census Bureau reinstated one million of these housing units into the census. (Nash, Memorandum 82, 2000.) None of the studies in this section included these reinstated housing units. Short form data items are the census data items that were to be collected for all persons and households. The data-defined population includes census person records with sufficient data to be accepted for further processing. Data defined records for Census 2000 must have at least two completed items. One item may be name, defined as at least three characters in the name field. Records that are not data defined are whole person imputations. -3719 18   The studies examined the field operations and instruments used during the housing unit phase of the A.C.E. and made recommendations about their use in coverage measurement for 2010.  4.1 Housing Unit Coverage Study Barrett, Beaghen, Smith, and Burcham (2003) examined the results of the Housing Unit Coverage Study (HUCS). The HUCS measured the Census 2000 housing unit coverage using data from the A.C.E. Using DSE, it estimated the net coverage of housing units enumerated in Census 2000. The HUCS estimated nonmatches from the P sample of housing units and erroneous enumerations from the E sample of housing units. Together they estimate the net undercount of housing units. Coverage of housing units enumerated in Census 2000 was comparable to the housing unit coverage in 1990. Table 6 shows:  C  A net undercount of housing units of 0.61 percent in Census 2000 and 0.96 percent in 1990. The net undercounts were both significantly different from zero, but not significantly different from each other. For occupied housing units, there was no observable significant difference between the 2000 and 1990 coverage, with a net undercount of 0.33 percent in 2000 and 0.53 percent i n 1990. A net undercount for vacants at 3.37 percent in 2000 was not significantly different from the 4.71 percent net undercount in 1990. Table 6: Comparison of 1990 and 2000 Percent Net Undercount of Housing Units (Standard error) Status National Occupied Vacant 2000 HUCS 0.61 (0.16) 0.33 (0.13) 3.37 (0.98) 1990 HUCS 0.96 (0.24) 0.53 (0.21) 4.71 (1.26)  C  C  Barrett, Beaghen, Smith, and Burcham (2003) also found the coverage for occupied housing units consistent with 1990 for various research categories such as tenure and type of enumeration area.  C  In 2000, the undercount for vacant housing units (3.37 percent) was significantly greater than for occupied units (0.33 percent). In 1990, the undercounted for vacant housing units (4.71 percent) was significantly greater than for occupied units (0.53 percent). -38-    C  As in 1990, the 2000 coverage for housing units not occupied by owners was not significantly different than for those occupied by owners. The net undercount for owner occupied housing units was 0.12 percent in 2000 and 0.37 percent in 1990. The net undercount for housing units not occupied by owners was 0.57 percent in 2000 and 0.80 percent in 1990. The net coverage of housing units in small multi-unit structures (2 to 9 housing units) was significantly better in 2000 (-0.17 percent net undercount) than in 1990 (2.25 percent net undercount). The net overcount of 0.17 percent was not significantly different from zero. The Census Bureau overcounted occupied housing units in small multi-unit structures (-1.30 percent) in 2000, but undercounted (2.11 percent) them in 1990. The size of the metropolitan statistical area did not impact coverage of housing units in mailout/mailback areas. For occupied housing units, the Census Bureau found no significant differences between the net undercounts for mailout/mailback areas in small (0.53 percent), medium (0.30 percent), or large (0.11 percent) metropolitan areas versus all other types of enumeration areas (0.22 percent).  C  C C  As Table 7 shows, the 2000 percent of E-sample erroneously enumerated housing units was slightly better than the 1990 percent. The difference of 0.53 percentage point was statistically significant. The percent not matched was not significantly different (3.62 percent in 2000 vs. 3.57 percent in 1990). Comparisons were made but they should be used with caution. The search areas were not the same for the 1990 and 2000 Housing Unit Coverage Studies.20 Table 7: National Housing Unit Coverage Estimates (standard error) 2000 (in percent) Net Undercount P-sample Nonmatches E-sample Erroneous enumerations 0.61 (0.16) 3.62 (0.15) 2.31 (0.11) 1990 (in percent) 0.96 (0.24) 3.57 (0.20) 2.84 (0.20)  In 1990 the search area was the sample block cluster and surrounding rings of blocks. The surrounding blocks consisted of one ring for urban areas, two rings for suburban areas, and a larger area for the most rural areas. In 2000 the search area was only one ring of surrounding blocks for all areas and the search was targeted to certain clusters. -39-  20   Barrett, Beaghen, Smith, and Burcham (2003) also classified the erroneous enumerations by type of erroneous enumeration. The types of erroneous enumerations are geocoding errors, duplicates, and not a housing unit.21 More than half (57.0 percent) of the erroneous enumerations in 2000 were because they did not exist as housing units in the search area on census day. In 1990, 37.3 percent of the erroneous enumerations were classified as not a housing unit and 33.4 percent of the erroneous enumerations were duplicates. The type of erroneous enumerations in occupied and vacant housing units were examined. Of the vacant housing units, 66.0 percent of the erroneous enumerations were classified as not a housing unit. Of occupied housing units, the largest percentage of erroneous enumerations was for the duplicated housing units (40.7 percent). Correctly enumerating vacant units continues to be a challenge. Estimates of net undercoverage, P-sample nonmatches, and E-sample erroneous enumerations for vacant units were significantly greater than for occupied housing units. Our estimates attributed almost 75 percent of the vacant erroneous enumerations to those classified as not housing units. The Census Bureau had a difficult time deciding whether an address identified a housing unit when no one lived there. A proxy provides information about vacant units or the Census Bureau bases the determination of vacancy status on observation from the field staff. The proxy respondent (or the observation of the field staff) may not be sufficiently knowledgeable, especially about vacant boarded up units and units unfit for habitation. Confusion as to whether to include or to delete these types of vacant units from the census inventory still exists. Small multi-units (two to nine housing units at the basic street address) remain problematic. Although net coverage of housing units in small multi-units improved over 1990, small multi-units had the highest percent of P-sample housing unit nonmatches and E-sample housing unit erroneous enumerations among the other sizes of structures. In future censuses the Census Bureau could customize address list building operations and/or census coverage improvement operations to target small multi-unit structures with two to nine housing units and vacant units to improve coverage. Clear instructions and training on what units meet the housing unit definition may minimize confusion of what units to include or delete from the census address list. Jones (Report 0.10, 2003) examined census housing unit duplication as measured by the A.C.E. Duplication for these coverage measurement processes was the amount of duplication within the search area. Duplication within the entire country was not measured by these coverage measurement processes. Table 8 shows that about 25 percent of erroneous enumerations were duplicates, a decrease compared to the 1990 Census. The search areas were different in the 1990 and 2000 Housing Unit Coverage Studies as described in the footnote on the previous page. Comparisons should be used with caution. Not a housing unit can be nonresidential or did not exist as a housing unit in the search area. A housing unit identified as not being found within the search area may have existed as a housing unit outside the search area. -4021   Table 8: Overall Percent E-Sample Housing Unit Duplication Year Percent of Erroneous Enumerations that were duplicates Percent of E-sample housing units that were Erroneous Enumerations Percent of E-sample housing units that were duplicates Estimated number of census duplicates  1990 2000 Jones also found:  33.4 24.8  2.8 2.3  0.95 0 .5 7  971,505 660,656  C C C C C  More housing unit duplication in small cities and rural areas. More housing unit duplication among units in small multi-unit structures than among single unit structures. More housing unit duplication among vacant units than among occupied units. Single units are more frequently duplicated when they are vacant. A relatively higher housing unit duplication percentage on American Indian reservations. Duplicate addresses referring to the same housing unit were seldom identical.  Jones' evaluation suggests the following for the 2010 census:  C  Duplicate search and unduplication efforts should target small cities and rural areas, multi-unit structures in small cities and non-mailout/mailback areas, and small multi-unit structures in the large and medium sized cities. Attempts should be made to improve the recording of all address information for the rural areas that are not mailout and mailback.  C  4.2 Conflicting Households Liu, Feldpausch, and Smith (2002) examined conflicting households identified after completing all person matching and housing unit matching. A conflicting household refers to the households at a matched, non-vacant address or individual housing unit, where the A.C.E. household and census household do not contain any matched or possibly matched people. The A.C.E. sample found 4,369 unweighted conflicting household addresses. Persons in these conflicting households accounted for 1.2 percent of the P sample and 1.3 percent of the E sample.  -41-    The census household was more likely to contain errors than the A.C.E. household when households were conflicting. This conclusion is based on the errors measured by whether the people should have been included in each household. An E-sample person determined to be erroneous and a P-sample person determined to be not a resident of the household on Census Day are both errors. In conflicting households, the E sample coded a higher percent of people as confirmed erroneous enumerations than the P sample coded as confirmed nonresidents (26.9 percent vs. 5.1 percent). Looking at the people with unresolved residence or enumeration status, there was a high degree of uncertainty in conflicting households.  C C  The P sample had a higher percent of people with unresolved status than the E sample had (30.4 percent vs. 26.3 percent); People from conflicting households had a significantly higher unresolved rate (30.4 percent for the P sample and 26.3 percent for the E sample) than people in matched (1.8 and 1.5 percent respectively) and not matched (3.7 and 10.8 percent) housing units. Including imputation for unresolved residence and enumeration status, the Census Bureau estimated a larger number of E-sample erroneous enumerations than nonresidents among the P sample (1,355,026 vs. 436,900). 22  C  Among the conflicting household addresses,  C C C  The Census Bureau found more E-sample whole household erroneous enumerations (1,057) than P-sample whole household nonresidents (646); The Census Bureau found similar numbers of P-sample addresses of whole household unresolved (1,132) and E-sample addresses of whole household unresolved (1,070). The followup interviews indicated that for 1,302 addresses the P-sample household rather than the E-sample household lived at the sample address on Census Day. There were 688 addresses where the E-sample household and not the P-sample household lived at the sample address on Census Day.  Renters, Hispanics, Blacks, people of age 18-29, males of age 30-49, and households in multi-unit structures had higher rates of conflicting households than their counterparts.  22  These numbers are from the unweighted conflicting households. -42-   This evaluation suggests that for 2010, the Census Bureau may want to direct efforts to reduce conflicting households by:  C C C  Probing for multiple households living at an address. Developing methods to ensure delivery of census forms in multi-unit apartments to the intended occupants of the apartment. Improving training for census and coverage measurement interviewers to identify the correct address.  4.3 Housing Unit Field Operations and Instruments Green, Watson, Smith, Barrett, Byrne, and Spratt (2003) examined the A.C.E. housing unit phase field operations and instrument. To determine how the field operations performed and identify improvements, they focused on results from the following housing unit operations:  C  Address Listing: August 1999 - December 1999 The Address Listing recorded information for all housing units within the sample of block clusters in Independent Listing Books. Initial Housing Unit Followup: February 2000 - April 2000 The Initial Housing Unit Followup occurred to get more information on housing units that could not be matched during the Initial Housing Unit Matching operation. Relisting: April 2000 - May 2000 The Relisting revisited housing units and conducted a new listing operation in clusters that the original lister had listed in the wrong block. Targeted Extended Search 2: January 2001 - April 2001 The Census Bureau performed the second Targeted Extended Search to ascertain if some of the housing units determined to not exist as housing units on Census Day actually existed nearby as housing units outside the cluster. Final Housing Unit Followup: March 2001 - May 2001 Housing units that were added to or deleted from the inventory of housing units since January 2000 were processed and the results were then used for housing unit estimation.  C  C  C  C  Address Listing was more successful in mailout/mailback areas because those areas had more city style addresses. Rural areas are more difficult to list accurately. The housing unit followup of the A.C.E. housing units identified housing units that should not have been listed in the sample areas because of geocoding error or they were not housing units on Census Day. One reason the followup was necessary was because the Census Bureau listed housing units under -43-    construction and future construction when the Census Bureau listed A.C.E. housing units between August and December 1999. Relisting operations were undertaken for a block cluster with 80 percent or more of the housing units geocoded incorrectly. The listing of housing units for the P sample needed to be as complete as possible. Less than one percent of the clusters were relisted. The second Targeted Extended Search operation provided evidence that there were some housing units classified as erroneous enumerations during the housing unit followup that were actually geocoding errors. Results from comparisons of Initial and Final Housing Unit Followup interviewer response patterns verified suspicions that some questions were not being understood by the interviewers during the initial phase. Green et. al. recommend that for future applications the Census Bureau give as much testing attention to the interviewers' instruments as the Census Bureau does to the instruments used by respondents. In particular, the Census Bureau should conduct cognitive testing on future followup instruments.  5. Conclusion and Recommendations The 2000 A.C.E. was well thought out and well designed, but it encountered some unexpected problems. These problems resulted in the final estimates produced from the March 2001 A.C.E. being declared unacceptable for apportionment purposes. The A.C.E. required a precise and accurate measurement of residence and enumeration status. Assuming the Census Bureau continues to use a coverage measurement survey to measure undercount in the future, we have some recommendations. More research is needed to design interview instruments to accurately identify people who should be counted in the household. Living situations have become more complex with multiple residences and mobility. More research is needed to understand sources of error, such as recall error and lack of knowledge on the part of proxy respondents, and to devise questions and categories that can be reliably and accurately reported. Intensive questionnaire design research and testing are needed to improve the quality of coverage measurements. (Martin, Fay, and Krejsa, 2002a and 2002b.) Designs robust to this error should also be investigated. The complicated, overlapping, and counterintuitive census residence rules make it difficult to measure coverage accurately. The rules need to be simplified and empirically evaluated. The Census Bureau will continue to research issues discovered with the A.C.E., particularly the duplicates and their estimation or detection. This research may lead to development of methods to improve future population estimates that combine information from the census, A.C.E., and the A.C.E. evaluations, including the Person Duplication Studies. Both census taking and coverage measurement evolve and improve with each census. The Census 2000 will help refine both census and coverage measurement processes for future -44-    censuses. We combined recommendations for 2010 into four categories - data collection, survey design, estimation, and coverage measurement evaluations.  5.1 Data Collection Review the residence rules and critical definitions. The Census Bureau should create simpler rules that can be understood by everyone as they fill out their census forms and as they are applied in the field. The rules should be consistent with the ways people think about their residence. The difficulty identifying erroneous enumerations in the 2000 A.C.E. may have been due to the census residence rules. Improve methods to identify duplicates and remove them from the census. People with multiple residences or other places where they can be counted can cause duplication. We need to identify which duplicates should be removed. Continually improve interview instruments used in coverage measurement and the evaluation. The Census Bureau needs instrument development and testing on conceptual, recall, and comprehension issues for group quarters residence, multiple residence reporting, and mover reporting. Reduce expensive, time consuming and labor-intensive clerical coding operations. Accurate classifications should be produced by standardized questions in the interview instrument, with a reduced need for interpretation by the matchers. The coding of responses should be consistent and have data editing. Redesign the housing unit followup instrument. The Census Bureau discovered P-sample housing unit geocoding errors after person matching. Therefore, the followup of P-sample housing unit nonmatches did not identify housing units listed as being in the block cluster in error.  5.2 Survey Design Think more about how movers are treated. In 2000 the Census Bureau used ""Procedure C"" with a few exceptions where we used ""Procedure A"". ""Procedure C"" matches the nonmovers and outmovers at the Census Day address and within the search area. ""Procedure C"" rather than ""Procedure B"" was used in 2000 because it is easier to match within the search area. One problem with ""Procedure C"" was interviews with whole households of outmovers were proxy interviews. ""Procedure B"" was used in 1990 where the nonmovers were matched to the Census Day address and the search area. The inmovers were matched to their Census Day address requiring collecting the Census Day address for the inmover, obtaining the census geography for the address, and matching to that address and it's surrounding blocks. This inmover matching was time consuming because the census questionnaires were printed from microfilm for clerical matching. The entire mover matching process could be improved in 2010 since names are -45-    captured for the entire country. A streamlined process that is fast and easy would need to be developed for geocoding and matching for the inmovers in 2010. The Census Bureau may want to consider using ""Procedure B"" in the future. Consider making the search area the entire country. Then, census correctly enumerates someone by counting them once in the country. An erroneous enumeration occurs when a census person is duplicated. This design requires a computer matching algorithm that accurately matches the P-sample people to all census enumerations in the country and identifies census duplicates. A followup interview would be needed to identify E-sample not matched people who were erroneously enumerated because they died before Census Day, were born after Census Day, or did not live within the United States on Census Day. An advantage of the search area being the entire country is making the problem with residence rules not a factor since a person is not erroneously enumerated when counted at the wrong location according to census residence rules. Alternatively, the search area could a smaller area would be easier than would also need to identify E-samp within the search area because they be the state matching in le not match di d not l i ve or other smaller area. Computer matching within the entire country. The followup interview ed people who were erroneously enumerated within the search area on Census Day.  Another design that exploits an expanded search area is any address matching. In any address matching the person interview obtains all addresses where the P-sample people could be enumerated. The research should determine if a nonhousehold member can provide these addresses. Analogously, this design identifies duplicates in the census by asking people not matched in the E sample for all places where they could be enumerated, which requires geocoding and searching these addresses. This difficult process of geocoding and searching the addresses was conducted for matching movers to their Census Day address in the 1990 PES. For 2010 the process would need to be made more efficient. Improved computer technology should make mover matching more efficient. The Census Bureau could also consider collecting alternate addresses on the census questionnaire. The design for 2010 could combine the automated and any address matching.  5.3 Estimation Consider a sampling plan flexible enough to implement either a state or national design. Build a plan into the weight trimming procedure that includes a threshold criterion. Impute missing characteristics using the same procedures in the census, especially for the E sample. Consider linking the P- and E-sample files to use in resolving missing data. When gathering information used to assign probabilities for unresolved person status, use information pertaining to the interview and less demographic information. Use generalized DSEs, a modeling approach that computes the probability of capture based on demographic characteristics. Use both the P and E sample when developing the -46-    post-stratification plans. Re-evaluate whether to correct for correlation bias in the DSEs. Consider whether the use of complex variance methods would be more beneficial in production or in an evaluation of the production variances. The Census Bureau should continue to use DA as a coverage evaluation tool. For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau should also investigate ways to measure uncertainty in the DA estimates of undercount and to expand DA estimate to more race/ethnicity groups.  5.4 Coverage Measurement Evaluations The Census Bureau should continue to develop programs to evaluate the coverage person estimation and consider how best to synthesize individual measured errors. The Census Bureau should consider evaluating the housing unit coverage estimates.  6.

The DA estimates of the net undercount are biased to the extent that people who are classified as a particular race in DA (e.g., Black) reported a different race in the census. The effect of the new ""mark one or more"" instruction for the Census 2000 question on race complicates the traditional comparison of DA estimates by race with census race tabulations. In fact, the Census 2000 tabulations do not include a category ""Black"" that is comparable to 1990 or earlier census tabulations. Tabulations for the Black population for 2000 contain tabulations of the number of people who reported Black only and tabulations of the number who reported Black whether or not they reported other races as well. To deal with the reporting more than one race, we present alternative DA estimates of census undercount using two models: (1) Model 1 compares the 2000 DA estimates for Blacks with Census 2000 tabulations for people who reported Black only, and (2) Model 2 compares the 2000 DA estimates for Blacks with Census 2000 tabulations for people who reported Black whether or not they reported any other race. At the youngest ages, the differences between the two models are the greatest. The tables and figures show the averages of the two model estimates for comparison with the historical DA estimates and 2000 A.C.E. results. These averages are not necessarily the best point estimates; research on the detailed Census 2000 race and ethnicity data to conducted later this year may provide a basis for determining at which point along the Model 1 to Model 2 range of census race tabulations the DA estimate might best be compared. A final inconsistency affects race comparisons of the DA and A.C.E. estimates. In 1990, the 9.8 million people (mainly Hispanics) who reported their race as ""Other Race-Not Specified"" in the census were redistributed (for DA estimation) to the categories White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; and Asian or Pacific Islander so that the census counts were consistent with the race categories of the historical demographic estimates. A similar modification to make the census race categories more comparable with the historical demographic data was again used in 2000 for the DA estimation. The inconsistencies in the race data place even more importance on the use of sex ratios for making inferences about coverage by racial categories in Census 2000. Specially, to the extent that the inconsistencies in reporting and the numbers marking more than one race are about the same for men and women, the inconsistencies will tend to cancel out in the calculation of sex ratios. We found this assumption held true: in Census 2002, the sex ratios for people who reported Black only are nearly identical to the sex ratios for people who reported Black whether or not they reported other races.

GX262-61-14139031	"July 26, 2001  Analysis Plan for Further ESCAP Deliberations Regarding the Adjustment of Census 2000 Data for Future Uses Background On March 1, 2001, The Census Bureau issued the Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) recommendation that the Census 2000 Redistricting Data not be adjusted based on the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) program data. The ESCAP was unable to conclude, based on information available at the time, that the adjusted Census 2000 data were more accurate for redistricting. By mid-October, the Census Bureau will recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for future uses, such as the census long form data products, post-censal population estimates and Census Bureau demographic survey controls. In order to inform this decision, further research will be conducted generating data for ESCAP's review. The analyses will focus on resolving the concerns that ESCAP identified during its deliberations for the redistricting adjustment decision. This document describes the research agenda and is organized by the topic areas of concern. The broad, overarching concern was that the Demographic Analysis and the A.C.E. estimates of the population were inconsistent. Even though alternative demographic estimates were produced by varying the assumptions underlying the Demographic Analysis, the highest reasonable estimate indicated that Census 2000 undercounted the population by 0.32 percent, while the A.C.E. produced a net undercount estimate of 1.15 percent 1. In previous censuses since 1960, the Demographic Analysis estimates were used to evaluate decennial census coverage. The estimate derived through the 1990 coverage measurement survey was reasonably consistent with the 1990 Demographic Analysis estimate of the total population. When the corresponding estimates for Census 2000 were found to reflect substantial differences in the population estimates, this concerned the ESCAP. Four scenarios were identified that could explain this result:    The 1990 census coverage measurement survey (Post Enumeration Survey), 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates, and the 1990 census may have understated the Nation's population, while Census 2000 included portions of this previously unidentified population. Demographic Analysis estimates might not have captured the full growth between 1990 and 2000, specifically due to static assumptions about critical components of international migration such as unauthorized migration, temporary migration, and emigration. 1    The 1.15 percent and 0.32 percent of the undercount rates are based on census counts that include both the housing unit and group quarters populations.     Census 2000, as adjusted by the A.C.E., might overestimate the Nation's population. This situation raises the possibility of an undiscovered problem with the A.C.E. or Census 2000 methodology. A combination of these explanations.    To address these possibilities, further research is required into the quality of the three independent measures of the population - the Demographic Analysis estimate, the A.C.E. estimate and the census count itself. Specifically, research will address whether the Demographic Analysis estimate was too low and/or whether the adjusted estimate was too high. The latter situation could have occurred if either the A.C.E. did not measure the coverage error accurately or the census count had coverage error reflected by components not measured by the A.C.E. In addition, the ESCAP was concerned about two other issues related to the A.C.E. estimates balancing error and synthetic error. Balancing error occurs in the A.C.E. when cases are handled differently in the two independent samples (the P- and E- samples) when identifying gross omissions and erroneous enumerations. This is explained more fully under section B.1.a below. Synthetic error reflects the extent that net census coverage within a post-stratum is not relatively uniform. Uniformity of coverage is the underlying assumption of the synthetic estimation process of carrying coverage correction factors down to the block level. The concerns regarding synthetic error are described more fully in section D below. The analysis agenda is organized around four basic areas of research: 1) recalculation of Demographic Analysis estimates using new migration assumptions as well as new birth and death data, 2) A.C.E. issues, including balancing error, 3) Census 2000 issues and 4) synthetic error. A. Demographic Analysis (DA) Research This area of research addresses the discrepancy of the demographic analysis data and the A.C.E. adjusted estimates of population. Specifically, this area of research will reexamine the historic levels of the components of population change to address the scenarios dealing with the possibility that the 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates understated the Nation's population and that demographic analysis did not capture the full growth between 1990 and 2000. Consultation with demographic experts inside and outside the Census Bureau has led to a research program consisting of a variety of research projects focused on the methodologies and underlying estimates of the components of population change. The research activities are concentrated in two areas:  -2-   1.  International Migration Assumptions regarding international migration are the most uncertain component of the demographic analysis estimates. The international migration component represents a combination of several components. Some of these components, e.g. legal immigration, are measured through continuous administrative data. For other components, e.g. temporary migration, emigration, and unauthorized migration, we do not have administrative data to provide continuous and current measurements. In the past, we have relied upon the most recent decennial data to develop a once a decade measure of these components. Thus, for the 1990 to 2000 decade, we would have relied upon the measurement from the 1990 census to develop an estimate for the 1990 to 2000 decade. This work will involve examining preliminary data from the Census 2000 long form and the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) to provide information to update the measurement of the international migration components. Although the research will focus primarily on those components less well measured, e.g. emigration, temporary migration, and unauthorized immigration, the work will also include research into all of the current assumptions relating to the components of international migration The first goal is to validate for the 1990 to 2000 period, the calculation of the components of international migration used in previous estimates. Then, using the preliminary data from the Census 2000 long form and possibly the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS), we will develop some updated measures of the components of international migration. The second goal is to assess if the documented calculation of the 1990 to 2000 migration components affect the DA estimate for 2000 and thus account for some of the discrepancy with the A.C.E. results. Research to be conducted includes the following:  We will examine the assumptions about international migration flows, specifically for unauthorized migration, legal immigration, emigration, temporary migration, and migration from Puerto Rico. Utilizing preliminary long form data from Census 2000 and other information sources (including C2SS), we can prepare the first set of documentation for our current international migration assumptions and we can assess the accuracy of assuming a continuation of the estimates developed from the 1990 Census data. Specifically, we will estimate migration using available long-form data on place of birth, citizenship, and year of entry and compare this estimate to the estimates previously used that were developed from the 1990 Census long form data. Thus we will evaluate differences in size and characteristics of previously implied flows based on current data sets. If appropriate, we will recalculate the demographic analysis estimates for 2000 employing any revised levels of international migration. -3-     We will assess the quality of the foreign-born and Hispanic population data (important because these data are major inputs to the setting of assumptions noted above). We will review edit and allocation procedures for foreign-born and Hispanic populations in the 1990 and 2000 censuses and attempt to quantify the effect (or at least address the direction of the effect) of any differences. We also will review the impact of any change in the edits and allocation procedures on the size and characteristics of these population groups.  2.  Robustness of Demographic Analysis In addition used in the underlying include the  to the research aimed at examining the components of international migration demographic analysis estimates, we will examine the remaining assumptions the Demographic Analysis components of change. These components birth, death, and Medicare components. This work will entail the following:  We will examine the consistency of the components by cohort and age/sex groups across time (1935 to 2000), including the historical international migration components. We will construct DA undercount rates for the 1940 to 2000 decennial censuses and examine them for consistency. We will examine the consistency of sex ratios across cohorts and age/sex groups. Inconsistent or anomalous results will be noted, and possible reasons identified. We will review the assumptions about the completeness of vital statistics registration. Specifically, we will review the historic levels of births and deaths used to develop existing DA estimates and the assumptions about the underregistration of births and registration of infant deaths. We will evaluate both the procedures for adjusting births for underregistration and the level of historical deaths (both total and by age). If appropriate, we will redevelop the historical annual levels of births and deaths to 1990 and 2000. We will examine the assumptions about the variation and coverage of Medicare data. This work will include documenting the differences in the sources of Medicare data used in the 1990 and 2000 DA estimates, evaluating the adjustment rates used for underenrollment in the 1990 and 2000 DA estimates, and reconciling the differences in the Medicare files for 1990 and 2000. If appropriate, we will recalculate the demographic analysis estimates for 1990, compare them to the original 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates, and assess their impact on the DA estimates for 2000.        -4-     We will analyze the consistency of DA estimates of the population, by race, ethnicity, and nativity, with Census 2000 and A.C.E. This work will entail 1) developing DA benchmarks of the population, by selected race, ethnicity, and nativity groups, 2) obtaining census tabulations of the native and foreign-born populations from preliminary Census 2000 and the 1990 Census long forms, and 3) comparing to the DA benchmarks to derive coverage estimates by selected age, sex, and race groups.  B.  A.C.E. Issues and Planned Research 1. Major Areas of Research a. Balancing Error The A.C.E. was conducted using a defined area of search, the sample blocks and surrounding blocks for clusters selected for targeted extended search. There were concerns, since there was a change in the 1990 procedure of expanding the search area to surrounding blocks for all sample blocks. We found 3 million more matches in surrounding blocks than correct enumerations after expanding the search area. This difference must be explained in terms of its impact on subsequent estimates of total population. There are two scenarios: C C The unit is located in the surrounding block with no effect on estimates of coverage, but would explain the three million difference. The unit is outside the search area and the corresponding people should have been coded erroneous enumerations. This would result in an overestimate of the net undercount.  This may have been compounded by the targeting used in the A.C.E. to match in an area of search around the sample blocks, i.e., the search area. This targeting to make searching effective may have introduced limitations and/or biases into our measurement of coverage. There were three specific concerns in our review of the 2000 A.C.E. C There were a number of census people that might have been coded as correctly enumerated although the housing unit was not actually located in the sample block. If we didn't estimate the correct number of erroneously enumerated cases, the result would be an overestimate of the net undercount.  -5-   C  The P-sample may have incorrectly included some housing units in a neighboring block, then in the extended search, the people would have been recorded as matching to the census in the surrounding blocks. Hence, these cases would appear to be balancing error when, in fact, the extended search was compensating for the original listing error. If the P sample had more geocoding error than expected, the Targeted Extended Search (TES) would have compensated for the error and the impact would be trivial and would have little or no impact on final coverage estimates. This would help explain some of the differences of the apparent lack of balance of 3 million. 2  C  Problems in identifying census geocoding errors may have affected the sampling used to select people for extended search outside the sample blocks. That is, the TES sample could have excluded cases it should have included and thus, not matched or followed up on them correctly. The effect of their exclusion would be an overestimate of the net undercount. It is likely that all of these errors occurred to some extent. What is not yet known is the scale of the error and whether the magnitude of the error was such as to significantly affect the relative accuracy of the A.C.E. adjusted numbers. The additional geographic field work is described in more detail in the attachment.  b.  Erroneous Enumerations Subsequent to the March 1rst decision, a new area of concern was identified. In comparing the A.C.E. measures to the comparable measures from the 1990 Census, the Census 2000 erroneous enumerations were found to differ substantially from the 1990 measures. These differences indicate concerns that the level of erroneous enumerations may be understated for Census 2000. Therefore, these differences must be explained because an understatement of erroneous enumerations results in an overstatement of net undercount. Research described below will quantify the accuracy of the A.C.E. measures of erroneous enumeration.  Assume 2.6 million of the P-sample are listed in the surrounding blocks. If 95% of them are in the search area (a plausible percentage), and if 90% match (about the overall match rate), then we have accounted for 2.2 million matches to the surrounding blocks. When we divide this 2.2 million by the Psample coverage of 0.94, we have accounted for about 2.36 million of the 3 million lack of balance. -6-  2   C  The Analysis of Measurement Error Study will determine how well the A.C.E. identified erroneous enumerations and correct enumerations. This study is based on a reinterview of a sample of E-sample records. This is described more fully in section B.1.c below. Another evaluation based on results from the `E-sample Erroneous Enumeration Study' will analyze the erroneous enumerations for various characteristics. This evaluation will compare the rates of the different types of erroneous enumerations for Census 2000 with corresponding 1990 rates. This evaluation will also recategorize people with unresolved status into the appropriate erroneous enumeration categories by using data from the followup forms. The goal of this work will identify explanations for differences between 1990 and 2000 coding of erroneous enumerations. The duplication study discussed in Section C1 will also provide information regarding the differences between 1990 and 2000. This study will validate whether the A.C.E. process is correctly coding census 2000 duplicate enumerations as erroneous.  C  C  c.  Total Error Model and Loss Functions Loss function analyses, reviewed by the ESCAP during its deliberations on whether to adjust the census redistricting data, were based on a Total Error Model that corrected the A.C.E. for biases, thus producing measures of the ""true"" population that could be used as standards for comparing the adjusted and unadjusted census results. The 1990 Total Error Model was adapted to the extent possible to ""fit"" the 1990 coverage measurement survey error components into the 2000 survey design. This model was updated with available Census 2000 data, but retained several error component measures obtained from the 1990 coverage measurement survey and 1990 evaluations, because the 2000 A.C.E. evaluation data were not yet available. Thus, the error model assumed that the actual A.C.E. error rates for these components were similar to those reflected by the 1990 coverage measurement survey results. This was viewed as conservative because it was expected that the A.C.E. was of higher quality than the 1990 coverage measurement survey. Work is underway to validate that the assumption above is correct. We are conducting studies to revise the 1990 Total Error Model to reflect actual A.C.E. error components, as measured by 2000 evaluations. Because of methodological changes between 1990 and 2000, there are issues that -7-   influence the comparability of this updated analysis to the March 2001 analysis. The analysis will include a discussion of the comparability.  The A.C.E. error components that were previously based on 1990 data will now be measured and input into the revised Total Error Model are: P-sample P-sample P-sample E-sample matching error data collection error discrepancy error processing and data collection errors  Synthetic error is not included in the total error model - this component of error is discussed later. A.C.E. error rates for these Total Error Model components will be obtained from the following evaluation studies.  The Matching Error Study will provide the A.C.E. P-sample matching error rate and E-sample processing error rates. The methodology consists of the clerical rematching of all of the people in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. clusters by expert matchers to determine the best match code possible. We will compare that match and residence information to the production codes. The Analysis of Measurement Error Study uses the results of the Evaluation Followup Interview to provide the error components for E-sample and P-sample data collection error relating to person coverage, and P-sample discrepancy error. The methodology consists of revisiting some of the households in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. clusters and using that information to rematch the Census and A.C.E. people in those households. The results of this study will determine the accuracy of the data going into the person matching process, such as the results from Census and A.C.E. questionnaires. This can involve reclassification of correct and erroneous enumerations. We will determine the accuracy of the residence status of A.C.E. people and how well the A.C.E. process identified Census erroneous enumerations (EEs) and correct enumerations (CEs).    Once the Total Error Model is updated with current data, new loss function analyses will be conducted. The loss function analyses will be expanded to analyze the accuracy of governmental units, in addition to states and counties. -8-   No loss function analyses will be run for congressional districts. d. Correlation Bias Correlation bias in Dual System Estimates (DSEs) results from a failure of the general independence assumption underlying DSEs due either to causal dependence or heterogeneity. Causal dependence occurs when the act of being included in the census makes someone more likely or less likely to be included in the A.C.E. Heterogeneity occurs when the census and A.C.E. inclusion probabilities vary over persons within post-strata. When heterogeneity within post-strata exists it is generally suspected to be of the form where persons more likely to be missed in the Census are also more likely to be missed in the coverage survey (A.C.E.). This will lead to underestimation of true population by the DSEs. The direction of the effect of causal dependence, if it exists, is less certain. Correlation bias in the A.C.E. estimates, whether due to heterogeneity or causal dependence, was assessed by comparing A.C.E. and DA results. Correlation bias estimates available for the March 1, 2001 ESCAP recommendation used DA estimates as of February 26, 2001. If further DA research results in revisions to the DA estimates, then the correlation bias estimates will be recomputed. The revised correlation bias estimates will then be used as inputs for revisions of the total error model and loss function analyses. 2. Auxiliary Areas of Research This section describes other areas that did not preclude ESCAP from recommending that Census 2000 data should be adjusted for redistricting purposes, but for which ESCAP would have preferred additional data. Further research in these areas will be conducted in order to confirm the ESCAP's conclusions. a. Missing Data Missing data occurs in the A.C.E. if after all followup attempts there remain households that were not interviewed or households with some portions of the person data missing such as age or race. Sometimes the missing item involves the status of whether a person matched, was a resident on Census day or was correctly enumerated. For a small number of people in the P-Sample, there was not enough -9-   information available to determine the match status (whether or not the person matched to someone in the census in the appropriate search area) or the resident status (whether or not the person was living in the block cluster on Census Day). Determining residence status was important for the P-Sample because Census Day residents of the block clusters in the sample were used to estimate the proportion of the population who were not counted in the census. Similarly, some people in the E-Sample lacked information to determine whether the person was correctly enumerated. Generally for cases with missing status a probability of resident, match, or correct enumeration was assigned based on information available about the specific case and about cases with similar characteristics. The rates of occurrence of unresolved A.C.E. cases for match status, correct enumeration status, and mover status were viewed as low enough to preclude serious biases in the A.C.E. results. We are now doing analysis of the missing data model to determine if the assumptions are correct. We will develop and apply alternative models for the treatment of missing data. These alternative models will be carried through A.C.E. estimation process so that the effect on DSEs can be assessed. b. Late Census 2000 Additions The levels of late Census 2000 additions were significantly higher than in the 1990 census. Late additions are those persons included in the final census counts, but which due to their late inclusion were excluded from in the A.C.E. matching and dual system estimation processes. For Census 2000, the late additions consisted exclusively of housing units that were temporarily removed from the census because they were suspected to duplicate other housing units, but which were later (after the A.C.E. matching process started) reinstated into the final census after further research was conducted. This differs from the 1990 Census in which the late additions were persons who were enumerated too late in the census cycle to be included in the matching and dual system estimation processes and were not factored into the coverage ratios. The A.C.E. design treated the late census data appropriately in measuring the census undercount. Two areas of concern require further investigation whether calculating DSEs without these additions resulted in a bias in the estimates and whether these impacted the assumptions underlying the synthetic estimation model. There is no expectation of a bias in the dual system estimate caused by excluding late additions. The dual system estimate can be expressed as a -10-   product of the 1) number of A.C.E. people and 2) the ratio of census complete and correct enumerations to the number of people in both systems. Consequently, any effect must come from one of these two sources. Excluding the late additions does not impact the estimate of the number of A.C.E. people, which come solely from the A.C.E. enumerated sample. Excluding the late additions also will not affect the dual system estimate of the true population if the number of matches is reduced proportionately to the number of census correct enumerations. Given the traditional dual system independence assumption, one would expect this result. Consequently, there is no expectation of a bias in the dual system estimate caused by excluding late additions. Data were not available at the time to validate this assumption. We will now attempt to validate this assumption by performing a rematch of the P- and E-samples, with the late additions included in the E-sample, to attempt to measure the impact on the rates for correct enumerations and duplicates. This rematch will be conducted in a one-fifth subsample of A.C.E. clusters. This study has limitations because only computer and clerical matching can now be performed; that is, no field work will be conducted. Consequently, a high rate of unresolved cases is expected. The concerns regarding synthetic error are addressed in Section D. ""Synthetic Error"". c. Conditioning Conditioning error occurs under two scenarios: 1. Census data collection affects the A.C.E. This will be measured in the correlation bias. 2. A.C.E data collection affects the census. This will be examined in the evaluation described below. The effect of potential conditioning of Census 2000 respondents by the A.C.E. operations was assumed to be minimal, similar to the 1990 findings. The research is necessary to confirm this assumption. An evaluation will examine whether census and A.C.E. operations were kept operationally independent. The analysis will be based on comparing Census 2000 results in A.C.E. and non-A.C.E. blocks.  -11-   d.  Mover Status Analysis The match rate portion of the DSE formula (M/P) uses persons with all types of mover status (nonmovers, outmovers, and inmovers), differentiating between the different types of mover status. Therefore, misclassification of mover status could cause the DSEs to be overstated, understated, or both, depending on the post-strata. The Measurement Error Reinterview Analysis will measure the extent of mover misclassification by using the results from the Evaluation Followup Interview.  e.  Housing Unit Coverage The coverage of housing units will be available in the late summer of 2001. These data will be examined in relation to person coverage estimates for 2000. These data from 2000 will be compared to the 1990 estimates of person and housing unit coverage. In addition, another study will assess the impact of housing unit coverage on person coverage. This study looks at the P-sample to analyze the effect of housing unit nonmatches on the person nonmatches. The E-sample is also examined to help understand the relationship of housing unit status to person status. The correctly enumerated people in erroneously enumerated housing units are of particular interest.  f.  P-sample Nonmatch Analysis The P-sample nonmatches are examined for variables such as race domain and age/sex group to see if the nonmatches are different for various types of people. This aids in the understanding of the components of A.C.E. and also helps explain the differences between A.C.E. and DA. In addition, the nonmatches from 2000 are compared to the nonmatches from 1990. In conjunction with the analysis of the E-sample, it helps explain the differences between 1990 and 2000.  C.  Census 2000 Issues and Planned Research Research will be conducted into two components of the census - duplication issues and imputation of persons. A high level of duplication not measured by the A.C.E. design could cause the adjusted census estimate to be too high. The effect of imputed persons records are -12-   also not measured by the A.C.E. The number of person records that were imputed in Census 2000 was significantly higher than in the 1990 census. The assumption is that the imputed persons are no different than the persons included in the A.C.E. process and therefore match rates are not impacted. 1. Duplication Not Measured in A.C.E. The A.C.E. methodology by design did not measure duplication between components of the population living in group quarters and in housing units because group quarters were outside the A.C.E. universe. The A.C.E. also did not measure duplication within the group quarters population. Significant duplication of these types could explain some of the differences between demographic analysis and the adjusted Census 2000 data. The A.C.E. E-sample will be computer matched to the entire census to determine the extent of duplicate enumerations that were not in scope for the A.C.E. This analysis will potentially explain some of the differences between demographic analysis and the A.C.E. We also plan an extended computer search within the A.C.E. E-sample for duplicate census enumerations among housing units and also between housing units and group quarters persons (which were out-of-scope for A.C.E.) This will help to explain differences between the A.C.E. and the 1990 coverage measurement survey.  2.  Census Person Imputations Census 2000 imputed a higher number of cases than in the 1990 census that came through the process with little or no information as to the occupancy status, or with an occupied status, but with no definitive population count. In addition, Census 2000 imputed more whole person records in cases with known household sizes, but with all the person data missing for some or all of the household members. Although the A.C.E. handled imputed persons appropriately in the estimation process, there was concern about not having information as to what census design processes contributed to the number of imputed persons when compared to the 1990 census. Given the potential impact that this level of imputations may have on Census 2000 data, it is essential to understand the demographic characteristics of the imputed people and how this may help explain the difference between the census and demographic analysis, as well as, how the imputations affect differences between the E-sample in 1990 and the E-sample in 2000. There were concerns expressed regarding the effect of whole household imputations on -13-   the heterogeneity assumption but these concerns are studied under the synthetic error analysis in Section D. D. Synthetic Error The synthetic assumption states that census net coverage does not vary within post-strata. For example, the synthetic assumption implies that census counts in Florida in a particular Hispanic post-stratum have the same net coverage as the census counts in the same Hispanic poststratum but in New York. The synthetic assumption within post-strata will permit the Census Bureau to draw conclusions from the A.C.E. sample about the population as a whole and then apply them to individuals living in geographic areas smaller than post-strata. The synthetic assumption is necessary to permit correction for small geographic areas based on a sample. This adjustment is only correcting for systematic biases and not local census errors. The error that is introduced when the synthetic assumption does not hold is called synthetic error. Synthetic estimation methodology is directed at correcting for a systematic under- or overcount in the census. The synthetic estimates will not result in the correction of random counting errors that occur for any entity (blocks tracts, counties, etc). Therefore, the synthetic estimate will not result in extreme changes in small geographic entities, nor will it correct for extreme errors. It is designed to remove the effects of systematic errors so that when small entities are aggregated, systematic and differential coverage errors are corrected. In the assessment of accuracy, the Census Bureau is concerned with synthetic error since it is not included directly in the total error model. The analysis of the effects of synthetic error were based on the construction of ""artificial populations."" These are populations that are created with surrogate variables that are known for the entire population, and are developed to reflect the distribution of net coverage error. This analysis of synthetic error and its effect on the loss functions was limited. Our additional analysis will expand the scope of the earlier artificial population work and add an approach using direct estimates of coverage at lower geographic levels. 1. Using Artificial Populations We will do a sensitivity analysis on the results from B-14. B-14 gave results for weighted and unweighted loss functions using one of two methods for distributing targets to post-strata and one of 8 models for correlation bias and percent of 1990 processing bias. This work will concentrate on the weighted loss functions and analyze the sensitivity of the B-14 results over both the methods for distributing targets to post-strata and all 8 models. Once again this analysis will be conducted for states and congressional districts.  -14-   2.  Using Direct Estimates We will calculate direct DSEs for census divisions and for states having sufficient sample size to produce direct estimates with reasonably low variance. Assuming the resulting direct DSE population estimates are unbiased, the mean square error of the production synthetic estimate of total population will be estimated.  E.  Schedule Some of the A.C.E. evaluation work being undertaken involves field work and/or additional computer or clerical matching work. The Evaluation Followup Interview was conducted in the field during the winter of 2001. The Matching Error Study matching work was completed in the spring. Results from these studies are being processed, with initial data being available for review in early summer. Field and clerical work for the TES2 and TES3 (described in the attachment) studies began in the winter and will continue into July. Results from these studies won't be available for ESCAP review until later in the summer. Matching for the late census adds evaluation is scheduled for late-July, with data available for review in August. Other research is being conducted on a flow basis as data become available and analyses are conducted. The ESCAP began holding weekly (or more frequent) meetings to review analyses of data related to the topics of concern beginning on June 18. It is expected that all of the research and analyses described will be completed by the end of September. The ESCAP will then discuss how the results impact their concerns and will make a recommendation by mid-October as to whether adjusted or non-adjusted census data should be used for subsequent purposes. During the September through October time frame, analysts will document the results of their research in evaluation reports, finalizing them in time for release to the public concurrently with the ESCAP recommendation.  -15-   Attachment Field Operations to answer the concerns about lack of balance In order to answer these concerns and explain the lack of balance present due to Targeted Extended Search (TES) and to explain the lack of balance that may be introduced due to TES, we will be examining the results of Targeted Extended Search 2 (TES2) and Targeted Extended Search 3 (TES3). TES2 followed up E-sample housing units that were coded as erroneous enumerations in the initial housing unit phase to determine if the unit was inside or outside the block cluster and surrounding rings. TES3 will follow up other types of units, both P-sample and E-sample, that may contribute to a lack of balance. In TES2 we are evaluating the housing units coded during the housing unit matching as not existing as housing units within the cluster. The block containing the housing unit selected for additional geographic work and the surrounding blocks were identified on a map. The field representative identified the block where the housing unit existed and the housing unit was classified as: C C C C C Existing in the surrounding blocks Existing outside the surrounding blocks Existing within the block cluster Not a housing unit Unresolved  So, a housing unit may be coded as in surrounding blocks or outside the search area when it was part of the block cluster. In TES3 we are also sending to the field a sample of census housing units classified as correctly enumerated in the block cluster. If a housing unit was classified as correctly enumerated in the block cluster in error, the housing unit was not eligible for targeted extended search in person matching. This could explain more of the lack of balance identified in the person matching. In addition, we are sending additional types of P-sample cases for more geographic field work and a sample of matches in the sample block as a control. These types of cases are: C C C P-sample people matched in surrounding blocks Not matched P-sample housing units P-sample people matched in the sample block cluster"

Analysis of the data reveals that farmworkers:            Numbered 342,102 in California as of March, 1997. Are overwhelmingly Latinos: 78 percent. Are mostly males: 72 percent. Have the lowest family income of any occupation surveyed by the Bureau of Census: $17,700. The median income of an individual worker is $9,828. Have the highest poverty rate of any surveyed occupation: 38 percent of the workers are below the federal poverty threshold. Have the lowest educational attainment: 69 percent of the workers have no high school degree. Are second from the lowest, after the private housekeeper occupation, in home ownership: 38 percent of the workers live in a home that the family owns. Work year-round for the most part: 56 percent work 9 months or more. Have the second highest rate of working more than 46 hours a week compared to other occupational groups: 30 percent usually work 46 hours or more. Have one of the lowest rates of health insurance coverage: 40 percent are uninsured. Are overwhelmingly non-citizens: 69 percent  by definition, these include legal residents, workers with a permit, or undocumented.  These highlights are more likely to reflect the characteristics of agricultural workers that spend most of the year in the United States. Every year around April waves of seasonal agricultural workers come to California. The March Current Population Survey does not wholly capture this population due to the time of year it is conducted. To adjust for this undercounting, and more importantly to provide additional insights into the lives of agricultural workers, we also conducted a literature review. Section 1 of the report contains the broader review; Section 2 offers more detailed charts using census data.  California Research Bureau, California State Library  1   2  California Research Bureau, California State Library   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY California is the nation's largest agricultural state. It produces more than 250 different crops valued at nearly $25 billion. California farmers are changing their crops to respond to consumer demand, producing more fresh vegetables, fruits and nuts. These high valued-added crops require more labor. During 1996, California produced nearly 14 million tons of fruits and nuts and 20 million tons of vegetables. This was more than half of the total U.S. production. A change in the structure of the agricultural industry is also underway, as small farms are consolidated into fewer, bigger farms. Larger farms often grow a variety of crops over a longer season, providing extended periods of work for farmworkers. Finally, large numbers of recent immigrants from Mexico, Central America and Asia, many with low educational skills, provide a ready labor force. These trends interact to mean that more farmworkers than ever are working in California, and that many are working for longer periods of time in one area, some as residents.1 Notably, around 55 percent of the state's agricultural workers are employed in the San Joaquin Valley. Although farmworkers play a significant role in one of the state's most important industries, their working conditions are difficult: low earnings, poor or no health benefits, substandard housing, physically taxing and sometimes unsafe work conditions, and long hours. Four-fifths of U.S. farmworkers earn less than $10,000 per year. Farmworker income is greatly affected by weather and crop conditions which can delay work in the fields. For example, this year's late rains have disrupted employment patterns and caused an estimated wage loss similar in magnitude to that of the 1991 freeze in the San Joaquin Valley citrus crop. Unemployment insurance will offset at best one third of the lost wages. In January 1992, Governor Wilson's Farm Worker Services Coordinating Council held six hearings throughout the state. Testimony provided by farm workers, local housing and health care officials, farm worker advocacy groups and others revealed a broad range of concerns and areas of need which have long existed. These include insufficient affordable housing, health and safety problems, low educational attainment, lax enforcement of existing labor laws, and lack of information about and poor access to social services. More recently (March and April 1998) the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ARLB) held a series of hearings across the state to consider revamping field-access rules. These rules give union representatives a limited right to enter private property in order to organize workers. Testimony from various individuals revealed the same issues identified at the Governor's 1992 hearings. Conditions have not improved since 1992 and, in the case of housing, health, and safety, may have deteriorated. Two main factors lie behind the worsening housing shortage: there are more farm workers and many farmers have ceased to provide housing. A shrinking supply with an increasing demand has led to higher prices in rural areas, resulting in housing costs that  California Research Bureau, California State Library  3   are high relative to farmworker income. Farmers reportedly provide less housing than in the past because few units meet federal and state regulatory standards. Many farmers hire their workers through farm labor contractors who directly employ, pay, and supervise the workers. Testimony at the Governor's hearings, and at the ARLB hearings, indicates that some farm labor contractors pay farmworkers by piece-rate, row rate or tree rate, and that these working arrangements sometimes can lead to working below the minimum wage. Some farm labor contractors run a closed shop, controlling housing, transportation, food and other necessities. There are many laws that set standards for worker safety and employer labor practices. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, Department of Industrial Relations, enforces the state Labor Code for all California wage earners. The Division conducted 455 agricultural investigations in 1997, compared to 647 in 1993. Of the 455 employers investigated, 130 were cited for child labor, workers compensation violations, payments in cash and minimum wage violations. Cal/OSHA is charged with enforcing laws and standards protecting worker health and safety on the job. Cal/OSHA conducted 298 field sanitation inspections of agricultural employers in 1997; 56 percent were out of compliance. We estimate that there are 154,000 agricultural employers in California (assuming that two farm labor contractors are employed at each of 77,000 farms). Farm workers and their children face many barriers in acquiring education. Children often work in the fields along with their parents to supplement the family income. Parents may be too tired at the end of a ten hour day to attend English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. Those that do attend classes have a difficult time, since their educational level in their native languages is often low. Farm workers and their children live in rural areas, where classes may not be available. Migration patterns and lack of transportation are other problems. Farmworkers often face serious health problems, given the taxing physical labor required to tend and harvest many crops. Agriculture is a fairly dangerous occupation, with equipment accidents and pesticide exposure as primary concerns. Most farmworkers do not receive health care insurance through their employment, many are not insured. Wages at or below poverty level and unsanitary working conditions are linked to health problems such as malnutrition, poor dental care, communicable and parasitic infectious diseases and development disabilities in children. There is a serious deficiency of data about the farmworker population. Most importantly, this population is generally undercounted by the Census. There are probably many more farmworkers in California than official records suggest. Inaccurate data makes it difficult to determine the seriousness of housing, health and educational needs and the types of services required by this population. It also means that California is not receiving its fair share of federal funds for programs (such as the Job Training Partnership Act) which are allocated on a population basis. Another useful source of data, the California Employment Development Department's agricultural survey, ended as of December, 1996, due to ""complications with data sources.""  4  California Research Bureau, California State Library   Section I A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE  Courtesy of the California State Library  California Research Bureau, California State Library  5   6  California Research Bureau, California State Library   CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS BECOMING MORE LABOR INTENSIVE California is the nation's largest food and agricultural producer, producing nearly $25 billion in value during 1996. Nearly one-third (29 million) of California's 100 million acres of land are devoted to agricultural production, producing 55 percent of the nation's fruits, nuts and vegetables. Americans and consumers in other countries demand more fruits and vegetables than ever before. To satisfy this increased demand for fresh produce, high-value, labor-intensive specialty vegetables, fruits and nuts are increasingly replacing the cultivation of mechanized crops such as hay, oats, and barley. Eighty percent of California agriculture is now planted in labor-intensive crops.2 For example, the cut flower and ornamental plant industry is the most rapidly expanding segment of California farm output: ""Farm cash receipts from the sale of U.S.grown ornamental horticultural products now bring American farmers more revenue than does all of U.S. wheat or cotton production.""3 These crops require more farm labor: there has been a 22 percent increase in seasonal labor demand over the last 20 years.4 For example, over a seven year period, farm employment doubled during the peak spring and summer months in Santa Barbara County; ""strawberries alone added approximately 8,000 new jobs by increasing cultivation from under 1,000 to nearly 5,000 acres"". 5 One researcher concludes that, It is the state's new-found prosperity in labor-intensive, high-value crops that ultimately attracts immigrant and migrant farm workers from Mexico. And it is the affordability of Mexican immigrant and migrant labor that, in part, explains the booming agricultural economy.6 Demand for farm labor is highly dependent on the many natural uncertainties associated with agriculture such as bad weather and pests. The 1998 growing season was delayed due to the state's long rainy spring, resulting in less labor demand early in the season. Conversely, according to an article in the Fresno Bee, farmers are concerned about potential labor shortages later on, when many crops may ripen at once.7  California Research Bureau, California State Library  7   8  California Research Bureau, California State Library   ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF FARMWORKERS VARY Estimates of the number of farmworkers vary significantly depending on the source of the data, from 470,900 (EDD, August 1997) to 900,000. Noted researcher Dr. Philip Martin of UC Davis states that ""California fruit and vegetable production will continue to require about 800,000 to 900,000 workers sometime during the year to fill the equivalent of 300,000 to 350,000 year-round jobs."" 8 The 1997 March Current Population Survey (CPS) estimated that there were 342,000 farm workers in the state. However, this yearly survey may significantly underestimate the number of farmworkers since many do not start work until the summer.9 A number of farmworkers live in unofficial dwellings, which are often missed by the Census Bureau, also contributing to an undercount. For example, according to the Parlier Health study in Fresno County, (see page 24 for a more detailed discussion) about 28 percent of farmworkers were not counted by the U.S. Census because they lived in unofficial dwellings. The characteristics of many migrant and seasonal farmworkers make it difficult to collect data on their situation. They often do not have a fixed address and work intermittently in various agricultural and non-agricultural occupations during a single year, with only casual employer-employee links. Many live in rural, often remote, areas. Many farmworkers have limited English-speaking abilities, relatively low educational levels, and are unfamiliar with or distrustful of government agencies and agents, such as Census enumerators.  California Research Bureau, California State Library  9   10  California Research Bureau, California State Library   WHO IS A FARMWORKER? The March, 1997, Current Population Survey found that farmworkers are overwhelmingly Latinos (78 percent) and male (72 percent). Nearly 70 percent of farmworkers are not citizens; by definition, these include legal residents, workers with a permit or undocumented. A 1988 survey by the U.S. Department of Labor found that 92 percent of California fieldworkers were not American-born. They were mostly from Mexico and Central America. A later survey found that 80 percent were male, two-thirds were under age 35, and seven percent under age 18. The National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), an interview-based survey of people performing seasonal agricultural jobs, provides an extensive picture of migrant farmworkers. The 1993 NAWS found that about ""four out of ten farm workers migrate, for at least part of the year, in order to obtain work. Three of ten workers are `shuttle migrants' between Mexico and the U.S., while one in ten workers `follows the crops'.""10 Only 3 percent of the migrants are non-Hispanic U. S. born workers. Migrants are defined by NAWS as someone who travels 75 or more miles in search of farm work. Farmworkers are not a homogenous group, either in terms of demographics, employment or economic well-being. For example, a significant population of Asian immigrants works in agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley, which is home to over 65,000 Lao, Hmong, and Mien refugees and their families. At one end of the spectrum is a farm worker in the Salinas Valley who may have worked for the same employer for a number of years, owns his house, speaks English, and has children in school.11 On the other end is a 19 year old from Oaxaca, Mexico, who has just paid a ""coyote""* $1,200 to help him cross the border. He travels to an area where others from his village are located and finds a job through a farm labor contractor. This farmworker speaks no English and in many cases does not speak, read or write Spanish very well or speaks an Indian language. He will most likely return to Oaxaca as soon as the harvest season is over.12 Mixtecs The Mixtecs are an indigenous people from a poverty-stricken rural region in southern Mexico, Oaxaca. They speak their native dialect, limited Spanish and very little English. Most are illiterate. As a group they have experienced discrimination in Mexico, a pattern that can continue in the isolated rural communities of California.13 According to a 1991 California Institute for Rural Studies estimate, there were between fifteen and thirty thousand Mixtecs working and living in agricultural towns across California.14 A more recent estimate is that 50,000 Mixtec Indians live in California, over one third of them in Madera County. *  ""Coyotes"" assist immigrants to cross the border illegally in return for payment.  California Research Bureau, California State Library  11   Geographic Location The Employment Development Department's 1996 Agricultural Survey presents the following data describing the geographic location of farmworkers in California. Approximately fifty-five percent of the state's agricultural workers were employed in the San Joaquin Valley region in 1996. The South Coast and Central Coast regions had the next largest shares of agricultural employment with nearly seventeen percent and sixteen percent, respectively. Agricultural employers in the Desert region hired nine percent of the agricultural workers in the state. The Sacramento Valley and the North Coast regions employed approximately seven percent and four percent, respectively. These 1996 percentages indicate that agricultural employment fluctuates very little between regions, since they are quite consistent with past years' percentages.15  12  California Research Bureau, California State Library   California Research Bureau, California State Library  13   back page of map of CA  14  California Research Bureau, California State Library   INCOME About 80 percent of U.S. farm workers earn less than $10,000 per year; half earn less than $5,000. The 1995 California Farm Employers Labor Service (a subsidiary of California's Farm Bureau Federation) wage survey found that wages for entry-level seasonal farm workers averaged $5.22 per hour. According to the March 1997 CPS, California farmworkers have the lowest family income of any occupation: $17,700, with a median income of an individual worker at $9,828 (see chart A). A majority of farmworkers work nine or more months during the year. Nearly one third report working 46 or more hours during the week. Many farmworkers patch together a series of short-term agricultural jobs in order to provide an annual income for themselves and their families.16 Chart A Median Annual Earnings in 1997, California $40,000 $36,500 $36,000  $35,000 $31,200  $30,000 $25,000 $23,000  $25,000  $20,000  $19,000 $16,000  $18,500  $15,000 $10,000  $13,500 $10,400 $7,000 $9,828  $10,000  $5,000  $Professionals Assemblers Managers Sales General Laborers Transportation Private household Other Service Farmworkers Low Family Income Technicians Protective Precision Clerical  High Family Income  The California Employment Development Department's 1996 annual agricultural survey reports the following data: Average annual weekly earnings in 1996 were $278.47, a decrease of seventy-five cents per week from the 1995 annual average of $279.22. The North Coast region had the highest average annual weekly earnings at $312.57. The San Joaquin Valley region had the lowest average annual weekly earnings at $267.03. The California annual average for agricultural hourly earnings was $6.71 in 1996, an increase of three cents from the 1995 amount of $6.68. Annual average hourly earnings for all agricultural activities were highest in the North Coast region with $7.55 and lowest in the San Joaquin Valley region with $6.45. 17  California Research Bureau, California State Library  15   It will be more difficult to assess California farmworker income in the future. The Employment Development Department reports that it suspended collecting data for its agricultural survey as of December, 1996, due to ""complications with data sources."" Some farmworkers earn less than the minimum wage. This occurs because in many instances workers are paid on a piece-rate basis. For example, a 1991 survey in the raisin industry found that workers were paid an average of 16 cents per tray.18 Workers averaged nine hours of work per day and earnings ranged from below the minimum wage at the time ($4.25) to $6.25, with a few workers reporting wages up to $8.00 per hour. Worker earnings determined on a piece-rate basis (or per tree or row) are sensitive to several factors including worker skill, vine and crop conditions, weather conditions, and the piece-rate paid by employers. The uncertainties associated with agriculture as a business also affect farmworker income, particularly the weather. A rainy spring has delayed the 1998 growing season, resulting in less work. A UC agricultural advisor estimates a loss of $6 to $10 million in farmworker wages in Fresno County alone, spread among the county's 15,000-20,000 seasonal farmworkers.19 Unemployment insurance will offset at most one third of the lost wages. This impact is similar to that of the 1990-91 freeze in the Valley citrus crop. At that time, state legislation was enacted that extended unemployment benefits for another 26 weeks for farmworkers, packing house employees, and other workers who lost their jobs as a result of the freeze.20 Farmworker families typically make ends meet by pooling their resources. For example, a family of six may have at least two family members working full-time while two others work part-time and intermittently. Family members share their resources in an attempt to prosper and provide for improved opportunities for future generations.21 ""Despite having low income levels and large families, rural immigrant settlers rarely use welfare services and other forms of state and federal public assistance.22"" Chart B Med i an Fam ily I ncome by Occupat i on, Ca lifornia 1997 $70,000 $68,587 $66,248  $60,000  $56,083 $52,400  $50,000 $43,110 $43,000 $42,469 $40,730  $40,000 $33,492 $31,600  $30,000  $29,400 $22,770  $20,000  $17,700  $10,000  Private Household  Transportation  $Managers Technicians Protective Clerical Professionals Precision Sales  General Laborers  Other Service  High Family Income  Low Family Income  16  California Research Bureau, California State Library  Farmworkers  Assemblers   EMPLOYMENT Farm work is seasonal unemployment.

California counties an important industry typically have very high unemployment had the highest unemployment rate of any county in May, 1998, large agricultural counties had unemployment rates above ten  However, unemployment is more concentrated in farmworker communities. For example, 90 percent of the residents of the City of Orange Cove in Fresno County work in agriculture. According to a recent article in the Fresno Bee, ""the impoverished city is beset with double-digit unemployment--about 25%--even during the summer months.""23 These impoverished rural communities are growing in California, as illustrated in the following case studies. Guadalupe Case Study A recent study of rural California by a researcher at UC Riverside highlights the City of Guadalupe, which ""...illustrates the rural population explosion as well as the resulting transformation of rural communities.""24 The study found that more than 150 communities in California with a population of less than 20,000 mirror the experience of Guadalupe.25 Guadalupe is a community in the Santa Maria Valley, in Santa Barbara County. The town grew from 3,225 to 5,479 inhabitants between 1960 and 1990. During that time the population changed from 18 percent Hispanic (in 1960) to 83 percent (in 1990). According to the analysis presented in the study, changes in agricultural employment practices in the 1980s resulted in hiring new migrants over settled farmworkers. Growers stimulated the new-worker recruitment, which kept wages low. Individual farm-worker annual income has remained under $6,000. Household income has shown some modest improvement, probably due to an increased number of working household members. The structures that housed seasonal farm workers in Guadalupe have been bulldozed. Most newcomers seeking agricultural employment in the Santa Maria Valley find housing in Guadalupe's larger neighbor, the City of Santa Maria. Santa Maria grew from 39,600 to 61,200 inhabitants between 1980 and 1990; another 8,000 persons settled between 1990 and 1996. The Hispanic population grew 111 percent between 1980 and 1990.26 Farm Labor Contractors The agricultural industry is increasingly relying on farm labor contractors to supply workers. A 1992 study of the raisin industry by the Employment Development Department (EDD) found that employers were shifting to farm labor contractors in part to avoid the employment liability and increase their efficiency by contracting out the paperwork involved in hiring workers directly. Farm labor contractors are the employer California Research Bureau, California State Library 17   of record and are responsible for the payroll and documentation system required for their workforce.27 According to a survey conducted by the Center for Agricultural Business Researchers in Fresno County, approximately 84 percent of employers who used farm labor contractors in 1991 stated that one reason for using them was to avoid dealing with various governmental regulations. The federal Immigration Reform and Control Act (1986) is one of several laws that requires employers to create a paper trail over hiring. Other regulations require withholding and documenting taxes, demonstrating health and safety standards, and paying workers' compensation, unemployment and state disability insurance. The relationship between grower and farm labor contractor is generally an informal one. Ninety-three percent of employers in the raisin industry who relied on farm labor contracts in 1991 were working under a verbal agreement. EDD's mail survey found that farm labor contractors earned a commission of about 31 percent, minus employer-paid payroll taxes and insurance, including OASDI (7.65 percent), unemployment insurance (as high as 5.6 percent), and workers' compensation insurance (around eight percent base rate in 1991). The remaining ten percent or less is the profit margin for the farm labor contractor. Any shaving of the government-mandated deductions increases that profit margin, an incentive that has lead to abuse. 28 Farm labor contractors charge their workers for various services. Sixty-one percent of the workers interviewed for the EDD study paid the contractor for their transportation to the fields, between $3.50 to $4.00 for each round trip. Some contractors also provide lunch and housing, at prices set by them. All of the surveyed workers but one were charged for the cost of the equipment they used on the job, such as gloves and knives. California law (IWC 14-80) requires the employer to pay for any required equipment if the employee earns less than twice the minimum hourly wage. The question arises as to the role and responsibility of the grower relative to that of the contractor. In 1997, ""both the courts and the Clinton administration undertook new initiatives that are designed to remove all ambiguity: under the joint employer doctrine, nearly all parties directly involved in crop or garment production will fully share liability for conditions of employment.""29 On April 9, 1997 a U.S. Court of Appeals rendered a decision that held Bear Creek Farms, a cucumber grower, jointly liable for its labor contractor's violations of record keeping, safety, reporting and minimum wage regulations.30 Section 1140.4  of the Labor Code, states that ""the employer engaging such labor contractor or person shall be deemed the employer for all purposes under this part.""31  18  California Research Bureau, California State Library   Sharecropping A November 1995 article in The Atlantic Monthly focused on California's strawberry fields.32 The article reports that the industry's annual sales exceed over half a billion dollars a year, a fresh fruit crop second only to apples in the U.S. Labor costs account for between 50 to 70 percent of the total cost of production. Sharecropping, which has existed in the California strawberry industry throughout this century (also known as tenant farming), provides an opportunity to lower labor costs. ""In California today, about 40 percent of the strawberries are grown and harvested by sharecroppers, as are more than 50 percent of the raspberries and other bush berries; more than 50 percent of snow peas, up to 25 percent of squash and green beans and 20 percent of cherry tomatoes, according to Jose Millan, an assistant labor commissioner for the California Department of Industrial Relations.""33 Theoretically, the sharecropper operates like an independent contractor, and so relieves the farm owner of any liability for unemployment insurance, workers compensation, Social Security and Medicare taxes. As a practical matter, the articles raise the question of whether these closely tied arrangements, which bind the sharecropper to the farm owner, are really independent. Labor Law and Safety Enforcement Both the federal and state governments enforce labor and safety standards. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (Department of Industrial Relations) enforces the state Labor Code for all California wage earners. According to the Division, staff investigate the agricultural industry for violations of the minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, cash payment, and workers' compensation. According to the data submitted by the Division, 455 agricultural investigations were conducted in 1997. Of the 455 employers investigated, 130 were cited for child labor, workers' compensation violations, cash payment, and minimum wage violations (see Table 1 below).

This includes California Research Bureau, California State Library 19   enforcing all laws, standards and orders protecting worker safety and health on the job, including in agriculture. As a practical matter, given the relatively small number of enforcement staff at Cal/OSHA, which has broad enforcement responsibilities for all California industries, and the size of the agricultural industry, inspections are irregular and of limited impact. One of Cal/OSHA's responsibilities is to enforce field sanitation. The Legislature enacted bills to improve standards and strengthen enforcement in 1990 and 1994.34 The prescribed standard requires that toilet, potable drinking water and handwashing facilities be maintained and serviced in a clean, sanitary condition and kept in good repair at all times. Field Sanitation penalties are assessed for the following:            No potable drinking water Potable drinking water not suitably cool No single-use drinking cup or fountain No toilet facilities Inadequate number of toilet facilities Unusable toilet facility No toilet paper No handwashing facility No potable handwashing water Inadequate supply of potable handwashing water No soap or hand towels  Table 2 details the number of annual inspections and the non-compliance rate.

There are approximately 77,000 farms in California. Assuming an average of about two farm labor contractors per farm, there are an estimated 154,000 employers. Cal/OSHA conducted 298 inspections in 1997, on less than 1/5 of 1 percent of farm labor employers. Of the 298 inspections, only 44.3 percent were in compliance and the remaining 55.7 were out of compliance. The California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Board) has the authority to amend safety standards. According to a data review conducted by the Sacramento Bee, most requests for amendments are granted. Of the 406 applications filed since 1995 to amend worker safety rules, 332 were granted and the others were withdrawn or amended.35 A June 8, 1998, article, ""Coalition pursues shift in tractor worker rules,"" reports the tragedy of Rafael Martinez, who was crushed to death as he jumped from a moving tractor to its trailer to sort fruit. State safety regulations {8CCR 3441 (b)} prohibit the practice, under certain circumstances. It results in a dozen deaths each year and more injuries. The Board is currently holding hearings on whether to amend the regulations to allow workers to climb off their tractors, perform another job, and then jump back on.    While on-site following up on complaint, inspect other contractors.

Insufficient income is a serious barrier to home ownership; fewer than three percent of non-migrant seasonal workers qualify for market rate financing for new housing. 37 About one-fourth of all farmworkers live on the farm where they work. Nearly 40 percent live away from their families while doing farm work.38 At the national level, an estimated 800,000 farmworkers lack adequate shelter. In 1995, researchers at the University of California at Davis conducted an assessment of the housing needs of California farmworkers. The study estimated that 250,000 farmworkers and their family members had inadequate housing, including 90,000 migrant workers and over 160,000 non-migrant seasonal farmworkers. ""The housing shortage is so severe that in harvest-time visits to farming communities...over the last year, workers were found packed 10 or 12 into trailers and sleeping in garages, tool sheds, caves, fields and parking lots.""39 The amount of farmworker housing registered with the state has declined dramatically in the last two decades. In 1955, growers registered more than 9,000 facilities to house migrant and seasonal workers. By 1982, only 1,414 employer-owned camps were registered. In 1994, only 900 camps were registered, with a capacity of 21,310 workers.40 In 1998, according to the Department of Housing and Community Development, there are only 500 farm labor camps registered. In November 1991, Governor Pete Wilson created the Farm Worker Services Coordinating Council by Executive Order (W-2-91). The Council was charged with coordinating state services to farmworkers. The Council issued a report in November 1992, identifying the need for safe, affordable housing as the number one issue of concern. In testimony given to the Council, employers expressed their frustration with government regulations that they contended discouraged them from providing housing. In some instances, they simply had bull-dozed their labor camps.41 The Department of Housing and Community Development undertook a major effort to review the status of farmworker housing programs in the late 1980s. Four public hearings were held during 1987 to determine the appropriate roles for the state government and the private sector in providing housing for migrant farmworkers. The Department issued a report with 13 findings, including the five listed below: 42 1. A majority of migrant farmworkers who do not live in government-sponsored labor camps live in seriously substandard conditions. 2. Substandard housing conditions exist in areas with significant seasonal agricultural production. 3. Housing conditions are a major problem for both single migrant workers and migrant families.  California Research Bureau, California State Library  23   4. Poor housing hurts migrant children's health, education, and general welfare. 5. Local officials vary in their support for housing migrant families. The 1992 Parlier Health Survey found individuals living in tool sheds, garages, informal shacks constructed of plywood or sheet metal, abandoned automobiles, and even underneath porches. These living arrangements housed 28 percent of the total number of residents of the community. The researchers found that ""back house"" residents had less income and utilized social services, such as food stamps and MediCare/Medicaid, at a lower rate.43 In 1991, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found 191 agricultural labor camps in California were in violation of the nation's Safe Drinking Water Act.44 A group of farmworkers in Soledad, California solved their housing problem by forming an association to purchase their mobile home park. The ""Cooperativa Santa Elena"" was purchased with the assistance of legal-aid agencies and the National Cooperative Bank, a privately held institution that supports low-income housing. About 100 families live in the mobile home park, each paying about $150 per month. ""This is the only trailer park in the country that's owned and operated by campesinos."" 45   Farmworker housing in Marysville, California    farmworkers  24  California Research Bureau, California State Library   HEALTH Agriculture is the second most dangerous occupation in the United States. Data from the California workers compensation insurance system show that in 1992 California farmworkers experienced more than 35,000 on-the-job injuries, or 11.6 reported injuries per 100 full-time employees. In 1990, there were over 22,000 work-related disabling injuries to farmworkers in California alone. Each year, around 40 California farmworkers die on the job.46 According to the National Migrant Resources Program, the life expectancy of migrant farmworkers is 49 years, in contrast to the nation's average of 75 years.47 There is very little statewide data on the general health status of California's farmworkers or their families. However, according to the March, 1997, CPS, farmworkers have one of the lowest rates of health insurance coverage of any occupational group; 40 percent are uninsured. The 1993 National Agricultural Workers Survey found that 32 percent of California's hired farm workers have some form of health insurance through their employer.48 This number may be high as many workers apparently confuse workers compensation insurance with health care insurance. Surveys of employers conducted by the Farm Employers Labor Service (FELS) indicate that about 13 percent of employers provide health insurance for seasonal employees. Family members are typically not covered. Researchers report that most farmworkers are unaware of public health care assistance, such as Medi-Cal: ""Documented agricultural workers think they are ineligible for assistance, and undocumented workers fear they will be reported to the Immigration and Naturalization Service."" 49 Workers who do use Medi-Cal find that it covers only pregnancy-related or emergency health problems, which ""...explains the observed overuse of emergency rooms by migrant farmworkers and their families.""50 Other barriers to health care include transportation, language, illiteracy, culture, lack of documentation, extensive and complex forms, and scheduling demands.51 For example, the majority of California's farmworkers do not own a vehicle and do not live near a health clinic. In the Parlier study cited on page 28, workers complained about long waits in the clinic, lack of respectful attention to patients, insufficient evening hours and of high fees charged to first-time visitors.52 In some rural communities in California, the newest farmworkers are Mixtec Indians from Oaxaca, Mexico. They speak their own indigenous language and many do not practice Western medicine, further complicating the delivery of health care services. There are few Mixtec speaking health providers. ""Diabetes and anemia occur in high frequencies among Mixtec women. Out of fifteen case studies followed, all had suffered from one or both of these illnesses.""53 Farmworkers spend long hours bending over to harvest low-lying crops such as cucumbers, beans, strawberries and squash.54 They carry heavy bushels and buckets of produce. They harvest fruit from the top of ladders, wearing canvas bags strapped over  California Research Bureau, California State Library  25   their shoulders, while filling the bags with 60 to 70 pounds of fruit. This heavy labor leads to reproductive and musculoskeletal problems. 55 A 1981 study in Tulare County gathered data on the relationship between work and health. Of the 467 families studied, work-related health problems accounted for 56 percent of all health problems reported. 56 Accidents were associated with farm machinery such as forklifts and tractors, and falling from ladders with bags full of fruit, causing fractures, sprains, contusions, puncture wounds, and lacerations. The rising incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is a serious health concern. Between 1985 and 1992, the number of active TB cases in California increased dramatically among the Latino population. Migratory agricultural workers represented between 25 and 50 percent of the reported cases in some counties.57 Agriculture has also been identified with the highest risk of occupational skin disease.58 The effects of skin rash are often intensified because of sun, sweat, and lack of sanitary facilities. Motor vehicle safety among farmworkers is a major problem. According to recent testimony before the ARLB, some farmworkers do not understand the motor vehicle laws. They may drive when they are tired, drive unsafe vehicles, drink and drive, not wear seat belts, and/or illegally transport groups of workers along with tools in the back of a truck. 59 Other Health Issues  Unsanitary working and housing conditions makes farmworkers vulnerable to health conditions no longer considered to be threats to the general public, such as communicable diseases. For example, a 1989-1990 measles outbreak in Glenn and Fresno counties resulted in the deaths of 33 children. As a group, farmworkers suffer a higher incidence of malnutrition than any other subpopulation in the country. 60 Access to oral health care is severely limited, with waiting periods of up to six months for a dental appointment. Several studies cite oral disease as the most frequent health problem within the farmworker population.     Pesticides Each year about 1,000 cases of acute occupational illnesses linked to pesticide exposure in agricultural settings are reported to the State of California.61 According to a study by James C. Robinson for the California Policy Seminar, exposure to pesticides and dangerous equipment are common in farm labor. This study found that surveys of farm laborers in California indicate that the vast majority have health complaints they attribute to agricultural chemicals, but only a small proportion seek medical treatment.62 Another researcher found that there is a substantial underreporting of acute pesticide-related  26  California Research Bureau, California State Library   illnesses in California, with one analyst estimating that up to 80 percent of pesticide illnesses are unreported.63 Exposure to pesticides can result in acute systemic poisoning--abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, headache, and malaise-or skin or eye problems, such as rashes, inflammation, or corneal ulceration. Other chronic health problems may include chronic dermatitis, fatigue, headaches, sleep disturbances, anxiety, memory problems, different kinds of cancers, birth defects, sterility, blood disorders, and abnormalities in liver and kidney function.64 Pesticides are also of concern because of their possible association with delayed health effects, such as cancer and adverse reproductive consequences. Agricultural workers suffer from respiratory illnesses due to exposure to respiratory toxins such as hydrogen sulfide, fumigants like phosphide and phosgene, ammonia, oxides of nitrogen from decomposing silage, herbicides and pesticides. 65 One study estimates that the effect of agricultural work on respiratory disorders in the farmworker population is equal in magnitude to that of cigarette smoking.66 Table 5 Opportunities for Exposure to Pesticides Usually an avoidable exposure Diluting and mixing; loading into applicators; applying to crop; flagging during crop dusting Drift; contact with residues during harvesting, weeding, pruning Eating or smoking in field; bathing, cooking with contaminated water  Often an unavoidable exposure  Frequently an unknown exposure Source: The Western Journal of Medicine, 9/1992  Different crops manifest different patterns of pesticide usage and illness.67 For example, skin and eye poisonings are caused by field exposures to residues of sulfur as well as mixtures of other pesticides. Residue exposure to harvest and packing workers accounts for a large fraction of total poisonings. According to regulatory agency data, ""workers in every [agricultural] job category can be exposed to daily doses of pesticides that significantly exceed levels determined to be safe.""68 According to a survey of 373 farmworkers in San Joaquin County, only about 10 percent of the surveyed farmworkers had received pesticide training; 90 percent had not.69 Community Health Case Studies Two important case studies of towns populated predominately by farm workers and their families are the McFarland Child Health Screening Survey of 1989 and the Parlier Health Survey of 1992. 70  California Research Bureau, California State Library  27   As a result of an unusually high incidence of cancer among children in the community of McFarland, the California Department of Health Services screened 1,697 children between the ages of 1 and 12 (90 percent of the eligible population) in 1991. The physical examinations revealed the following problems:        71 percent of the children required a medical referral to treat one or more adverse health outcomes, 40 percent of the children were referred for vision care, 37 percent of children needed dental care, 24 percent of the children had anemia, 15 percent of children under the age of four had incomplete immunizations, Half of the children over the age of 5 had never seen a dentist, Half of the children lacked a timely physical examination, including 8 percent who had never had a physical examination.  Parlier is a small city of 10,000 residents located 20 miles southeast of Fresno. The Parlier study found similar findings to those in McFarland with regard to dental and vision care.   42 percent of the sample had never been to a dentist. 60 percent of the sample had never been to an eye doctor.  San Joaquin Valley Health Facts71 Half of the State's approximately 800,000 migrant and seasonal farmworkers live and work in the San Joaquin Valley. Many reside permanently in the area.72 For this reason, we include the following data as a broad representation of communities in which many farmworkers live. Demographically, the San Joaquin Valley is younger, poorer, and more Latino than California as a whole. In 1994, the average hourly earnings of a farmworker in the San Joaquin Valley was $6.36. The average annual income was approximately $7,500. All San Joaquin Valley counties have childhood poverty rates above the state average of 18 percent (1993). Tulare County's rate of 33 percent was the highest childhood poverty rate in the state. Lack of access to prenatal care varies considerably in San Joaquin Valley communities; for example, from a high of 51 percent in the community of Huron to a low of 12 percent in Herndon/Pinedale, both in Fresno County.73 Kern County (10 per 1,000 live births) and Fresno County (9.4 per 1,000) have the worst overall infant death rates in the State. The San Joaquin Valley has lower rates of cancer deaths and tuberculosis than the state as a whole, and the lowest rates of AIDS in the state. In the San Joaquin Valley, childhood anemia (low volume of red blood corpuscles in the bloodstream resulting in low energy, paleness, general weakness) was above the 1993  28  California Research Bureau, California State Library   state average of 19.3 percent for children under age five. Childhood anemia in Kings County was 31 percent, in Merced 22.9 percent and Tulare 19.9 percent. Births to adolescents varied from a low of 5 percent to a high of 25 percent among 61 sampled San Joaquin Valley communities. Kings, Fresno, Madera and Tulare counties had rates of 7 percent or higher in 1993, compared to a statewide rate of 4.6 percent.74 All San Joaquin Valley counties rate at a ""higher risk and special need"" for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) for low-income pregnant, breast-feeding and post-partum women, infants and children up to the age of five who are at nutritional risk. Kern County has the greatest need (a rank of 11 out of 11); Fresno, Madera and San Joaquin rank 10 out of 11.75 Cultural and language barriers are impediments to care, especially for Southeast Asian immigrant women and Mixtec farmworkers from Oaxaca, Mexico. An estimated 50,000 Mixtec Indians live in California, over one third of them in Madera County. Many do not speak Spanish or English. The San Joaquin Valley is home to over 65,000 Lao, Hmong and Mien refugees and their families.

A Government Accounting Office study estimates that about 25 percent of farm labor in the U.S. is performed by children.76 The labor of these children is important to their family income. Many farmworkers are paid by piece-rate and their children can help to fill bins of fruit or vegetables, thin and harvest orchards, weed plants, or care for farm animals. Lack of childcare is another reason that children are in the fields. Parents bring their young children to work because they have no other place to leave them. As a result, children are exposed to the same hazards associated with farm work. A review of the literature found agricultural workplace fatalities pesticides, poor field sanitation, transportation, and fatigue from that: ""Children account for a disproportionate share of and disabling injuries.""77 These include farm machinery, substandard or nonexistent housing, unsafe doing physically demanding work for long periods.  Children are more susceptible to pesticide exposure than adults because they absorb more pesticides per pound of body weight and their developing nervous systems and organs are vulnerable.78 ""A recent study in New York State found over 40 percent of the interviewed children had worked in fields that were wet with pesticides, and 40 percent had been sprayed while in the fields or orchards.""79 Pesticide exposure results from touching the residues, breathing the air, drinking the water, eating the food and from inadequate sanitary facilities for washing, drinking water, and toilets. Commonly reported health problems among the children of migrant farmworkers include lower height and weight, respiratory diseases, parasitic conditions, skin infections, chronic diarrhea, Vitamin A deficiency, and undiagnosed congenital and developmental problems. Children are also at high risk of infectious diseases that are spread by poor sanitation in the fields and in substandard housing.80 Heat-related illnesses include heat stroke, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and dermatitis or skin rash. Children in the fields are injured falling from heights and by faulty equipment, knives, machetes, and vehicles. Irrigation ditches can be dangerous, as some children drown in them. Migrant farmworkers and their families have general population. The infant mortality rate among the general population.81 A survey of found that 11 percent of migrant children had national rate of 3 percent.82 poor physical health compared to the among migrants is 125 percent higher than migrant women and children in Wisconsin chronic health conditions compared to  California Research Bureau, California State Library  31   32  California Research Bureau, California State Library   EDUCATION There is very little statewide data on the educational status of farmworkers or their children. The data that is available is primarily for migrant children. Testimony provided by farmworkers to the Governor's Farm Worker Services Coordinating Council during six statewide public hearings held in 1992 elicited the following comments:83 Farmworkers testified about ""the need to learn English and the inability to access classes in English as a Second Language (ESL). Problems include overflowing enrollments in existing classes, insufficient classes in rural areas, and the lack of transportation to urban area classes."" Testimony also addressed the high dropout rates caused when children are removed from school to work in the fields to help support their families. Migratory work patterns also contributed to the children falling behind in school, exacerbating the dropout rate. According to the March, 1997, Current Population Survey, 69 percent of farmworkers in California have not completed high school. Language According to the 1990 Census, at least 50 percent of farmworkers do not speak English well. In a recent study conducted by Mr. Mason, Director of the Center of Agricultural Business at California State University in Fresno, 80 percent of the farmworkers interviewed responded that they could not read English or understood only a few basic words. Eight percent also stated that they could not read in Spanish. According to Mr. Mason, more and more workers are arriving from Southern Mexico and Central America, where many individuals do not speak Spanish.84 In 1993, San Joaquin Valley California Highway Patrol officials reported encountering many drivers who did not speak English and who might not be literate in their native language. These drivers often did not know the driving laws nor understand common road signs or principles of hazard prevention.85 Migrant Education Migrant farmworkers are a subpopulation of farmworkers. The definition of migrant farmworker varies substantially. For migrant education services, it is ""if they have moved during the last 36 months because they or members of their family were trying to obtain temporary or seasonal employment in agricultural, dairy, fishing, or logging services.""86 Children of migrant farmworkers are among the most educationally disadvantaged children in the country. Multiple obstacles to educational achievement include  California Research Bureau, California State Library  33   discontinuity in education, social and cultural isolation, strenuous work outside of school, extreme poverty and poor health, as well as limited English proficiency. 87 In 1990, the National Agricultural Workers Survey estimated 587,000 children of migrant workers moved once in the previous year. States identified 597,000 children in the U.S. as eligible for Migrant Education Program (MEP) Services in 1990, based on the criterion of migratory relocation in the last 6 months. In 1994, 657,373 children were identified as eligible. During the 1992-93 school year, California had 30.8 percent of the Migrant Education Program national total, or 166,793 children. (Texas was next with 17.6 percent or 95,703 children.)

S. were not proficient in English in 1992-93. In California, 28.2 percent of migrant students had limited English proficiency. Eighty percent were Hispanic. Of the adults, 84 percent spoke little or no English and 90 percent spoke a language other than English in the home. Discontinuity in the school year contributes to lower academic achievement and high dropout rates. Children drop out to work and to care for younger siblings while parents are working, leading to higher absenteeism and a low graduation rate. Migrant youth have the lowest graduation rate of any population in U.S. public schools, estimated at 40 to 55 percent depending on the survey.  34  California Research Bureau, California State Library   Section II A STATISTICAL PROFILE OF FARMWORKERS RELATIVE TO OTHER OCCUPATIONS  Courtesy of the California State Library  California Research Bureau, California State Library  35   36  California Research Bureau, California State Library   What follows is a comparative analysis of farmworkers in California. The analysis below is unique in that farmworkers are compared to other occupational groups in a variety of areas. Moreover, in using the 1997 March Current Population Survey, we provide information from one consistent source. There are a few charts, however, where the information comes from the 1990 Census. Please note that although the focus of the analysis that follows is on farmworkers, the charts can readily serve as a reference for other occupations. ABOUT THE OCCUPATIONS In making the comparisons, we define farmworkers as those that work directly in a farm related occupation. We exclude from the list farm operators, gardeners, and those in forestry or fishing occupations. In the tables that follow, there are thirteen major occupational categories. Except for the farmworker category, the other occupations are provided by the Bureau of the Census and are grouped according to the Standard Occupational Classification. The occupational categories are self-explanatory in some cases. There are four that may not be. These are protective, precision, assemblers, and other service.     Protective services are firefighters, police, guards, and correctional officers. Precision includes mechanics, carpenters, electricians, roofers, and other skilled workers. Assembler includes workers in an assembly line or operators of a machine. Other Services are bartenders, waiters, cooks, janitors, barbers, and any other service occupation not classified elsewhere.  Since the tables that follow have thirteen occupational categories, it is often helpful to think of them as belonging to three different educational groups. The first three categories (professionals, managers, and technicians) generally require more academic education. The next five categories (sales, protective, clerical, transportation, and precision) require schooling more along vocational lines. The last five categories (general laborers, assemblers, other service, private household, and farmworkers) are the least stringent in terms of educational requirements. Not everybody from each occupation falls neatly into such educational categories; the generalizations are useful however when viewing the tables that follow.  California Research Bureau, California State Library  37   FARMWORKERS VERSUS OTHER OCCUPATIONS According to the charts that follow, one can conclude that farmworkers are at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder in comparison to the other occupational groups. To make this point, we order the occupations according to family income in the following charts. In all but a few cases, there are big differences between farmworkers and the other occupations. Farmworkers stand out in ethnic composition, male representation, hours worked, citizenship status, home ownership, health insurance coverage, and educational attainment. DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION Compared to other occupations in California, farmworkers are not as numerous. In California there are at least six occupations that have more than a million individuals. Three other categories have more than half a million. Farmworkers numbered 342,102 as of March 1997, which is probably a low figure1. There are two other occupational groups that are smaller than farmworkers: protective and private household (see Chart 1). Chart 2 shows that the farmworker occupation has the highest representation of Latinos. Of the 342,102 farmworkers, 78 percent are Latinos. The occupations that follow are assemblers and private household with over half of the workers being Latino. In the chart, the representation of Latinos decreases as one moves from left to right with professionals having the smallest share of Latinos. Farmworkers do not have the highest share of male workers (see Chart 3). The following four other occupations have higher shares: transportation (94%), precision (92%), general laborers (84%), and protective (75%). Fifth in line are farmworkers (72%). The occupations with the fewest male workers are private household (4%) and clerical (26%).  1  As noted in Section 1, this number may be low due to the time of year of the sample, before the peak of the agricultural season, and because of an acknowledged undercount by the Census.  38  California Research Bureau, California State Library   Chart 1 California Research Bureau, California State Library 39  Number of Workers Within Each Occupation, California 1997 3,000,000  2,535,623  2,460,694  2,500,000 2,096,404 2,159,396  2,000,000 1,829,274  1,516,232  1,500,000  1,000,000 658,301  950,786  500,000  495,017 266,634  511,141 342,102 168,783  General Laborers  Private Household  Transportation  Other Service  Professionals Technicians Protective Managers Clerical Precision Sales  Chart 1: Number of Workers Within Each Occupation High Family Income  Low Family Income  Farmworkers  Assemblers   40  California Research Bureau, California State Library   Chart 2  General Laborers  Sales  Other Service  Professionals  Chart 2: Percent Latinos Within Each Occupation High Family Income  Private Household  Transportation  Low Family Income  Farmworkers  Clerical  Precision  Technicians  Assemblers  Managers  Protective  California Research Bureau, California State Library 41  Percent Latinos Within Each Occupation, California 1997 80% 78%  70% 65%  60% 55%  50% 41%  40% 32% 34%  39%  30% 22% 20% 22%  20% 12% 10%  18%  10%  0%   42  California Research Bureau, California State Library   General Laborers  Private Household  Transportation  Other Service  Professionals  Chart 3: Percent Males Within Each Occupation High Family Income  Low Family Income  Farmworkers  Technicians  Protective  Managers  Clerical  Precision  Sales  Assemblers  California Research Bureau, California State Library 43  Chart 3  Percent Males Within Each Occupation, California 1997 100% 92% 94% 84%  90% 80% 70% 60% 53% 57% 51% 52% 46% 61% 75% 72%  50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 26%  4%  0%   44  California Research Bureau, California State Library   INCOME AND POVERTY In terms of family income, farmworkers rank the lowest of any group with an average annual income for the family of $17,700 (see Chart 4). At the high end are professionals and managers with family incomes over $60,000. According to Chart 5, a typical farmworker makes $9,828 a year, higher only than private household. Notice that the pattern of Chart 5 differs from that of Chart 4. The difference comes in the number of persons that work in the family and in the occupations of these other persons. For instance, a person in sales has a relatively low individual income, but if married to a technician, the family income increases to $50,000. Chart 6 differs from the income variables in that it also takes family size into account in determining poverty. Based on both family income and family size, Chart 6 shows that farmworkers have the highest poverty rates, with 38 percent of them being at or below the federal poverty level.

This guidance, which has been developed with the involvement of many Federal agencies, essentially was requested by those agencies and the many users of data on race and ethnicity. The guidance focuses on three areas: collecting data using the new standards, tabulating data collected under the new standards, and building bridges to compare data collected under the new and the old standards. At this juncture, the guidance is often in the form of alternatives for discussion rather than recommendations for implementation. In many areas work is ongoing, and the guidance will be amended as additional research and analyses are completed. At this juncture, we are seeking broader comment on the guidance. In keeping with the process that guided review and revision of the standards for data on race and ethnicity, we are looking forward to an open dialogue on this draft provisional guidance. Following a two month period for discussion by stakeholders within and outside government, we expect to issue provisional guidance at the end of April. We expect the guidance issued at that time will evolve further as data from Census 2000 and other data collections employing the new collection standards become available. We look forward to your review and comments, and welcome your questions. Katherine K.

To foster comparability across data collections carried out by various agencies, it is useful for those agencies to report responses of more than one race using some standardized tabulations or formats. The report briefly explains why the tabulation guidelines are needed, reviews the general guidance issued when the new standards were adopted in October 1997, and provides information on the criteria used in developing the guidelines. This report also addresses a larger set of implementation questions that have emerged during the working group' deliberations. Thus, the s report considers: C C C C Collecting data on race and ethnicity using the new standards, including aggregate data reporting, Tabulating Census 2000 data and data on race and ethnicity collected in surveys and from administrative records, Using data on race and ethnicity in applications such as legislative redistricting and equal employment opportunity monitoring, and Comparing data under the old and the new standards when conducting analyses.  In addition, the appendices to the draft report contain the full text of the reports on the research that has been conducted in two areas: best procedural practices for implementing the new standards, and approaches for bridging between data collected under the old standards and data collected under the new standards. The guidelines are necessarily provisional pending the availability of data from Census 2000 and other data systems as the new standards are implemented. They are likely to be reviewed and refined as Federal agencies and others gain experience with data collected under the new 5   standards. In addition, in some portions of this report, guidelines have not yet been determined. Instead, options are presented and guidelines in these areas will be issued at a later date. OMB expects to issue this provisional guidance by the end of April 1999, following a period of public discussion of this draft by interested users. As noted in the Table of Contents and the report, a few sections are still ""under development""and will be available for review at a later time.  6   I.  BACKGROUND  This part of the report discusses why guidance is needed for tabulating data collected using the 1997 standards, reiterates the general guidance issued in October 1997, provides clarification of several aspects of the new standards, and presents the criteria that were developed for evaluating bridging methods and presenting data. A. The Need for Tabulation Guidelines and Alternative Approaches On October 30, 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published ""Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity"" (Federal Register, 62 FR 58781 - 58790), which are reprinted in Appendix A. The new standards reflect a change in data collection policy, making it possible for Federal agencies to collect information that reflects the increasing diversity of our Nation's population stemming from growth in interracial marriages and immigration. Under the new policy, agencies are now required to offer respondents the option of selecting one or more of the following five racial categories included in the updated standards: -American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used in addition to ""Black or African American."" Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.  --  --  ---  These five categories are the minimum set for data on race for Federal statistics, program administrative reporting, and civil rights compliance reporting. With respect to ethnicity, the standards provide for the collection of data on whether or not a person is of ""Hispanic or Latino"" culture or origin. (The standards do not permit a multiple response that would indicate an ethnic heritage that is both Hispanic or Latino and non-Hispanic or Latino.) This category is defined as follows: 7   --  Hispanic or Latino. A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, ""Spanish origin,"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic or Latino.""  As a result of the change in policy for collecting data on race, the reporting categories used to present these data must similarly reflect this change. In keeping with the spirit of the new standards, agencies cannot collect multiple responses and then report and publish data using only the five single race categories. Agencies are expected to provide as much detail as possible on the multiple race responses, consistent with agency confidentiality and data quality procedures. As provided by the standards, OMB will consider any agency variances to this policy on a case by case basis. Based on research to date, it is estimated that less than two percent of the Nation's total population is likely to identify with more than one race. This percentage may increase as those who identify with more than one racial heritage become aware of the opportunity to report more than one race. In the early years of the standards'implementation, there will be issues of data quality and confidentiality related to sample size that may restrict the amount of data that can be published for some combinations of multiple race responses. Over time, however, the size of these data cells may increase. It should be noted that such data quality and confidentiality problems for small population groups also existed under the old standards, where sample sizes prevented presentation of data on certain population groups such as American Indians. The possible multiple race combinations under the new standards, some with small data cells, serve to make such data quality concerns more apparent. Some balance will need to be struck between having a tabulation showing the full distribution of all possible combinations of multiple race responses and presenting only the minimum -- that is, a single aggregate of people who reported more than one race. B. General Guidelines for Tabulating Data on Race In response to concerns that had been raised about how Federal agencies would tabulate multiple race responses, OMB in the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice issued the following general guidance: C Consistent with criteria for confidentiality and data quality, the tabulation procedures used by the agencies should result in the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as possible. Guidelines for tabulation ultimately must meet the needs of at least two groups within the Federal Government, with the overriding objective of providing the most accurate and informative body of data. (1) The first group is composed of those Federal Government officials charged with carrying out constitutional and legislative mandates, such as redistricting 8  C   legislatures, enforcing civil rights laws, and monitoring progress in antidiscrimination programs. (The legislative redistricting file produced by the Bureau of the Census, also known as the Public Law 94-171 file, is an example of a file meeting such legislative needs.) (2) C The second group consists of the staff of Federal statistical agencies producing and analyzing data that are used to monitor economic and social conditions and trends. provides, racial and the add to the  Many of the needs of the first group can be met with an initial tabulation that consistent with standards for data quality and confidentiality, the full detail of reporting; that is, the number of people reporting in each single race category number reporting in each of the possible combinations of races, which would total population.  C  Depending on the judgment of users, the combinations of multiple responses could be collapsed. (1) One method would be to provide separate totals for those reporting in the most common multiple race combinations and to collapse the data for other less frequently reported combinations. The specifics of the collapsed distributions would be dependent on the results of particular data collections. A second method would be to report the total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination with other races. These totals would represent upper bounds on the size of the populations who identified with each of the racial categories. In some cases, this latter method could be used for comparing data collected under the old standards with data collected under the new standards.  (2)  C C  It is important that Federal agencies with the same or closely related responsibilities adopt the same tabulation method. Regardless of the method chosen for collapsing multiple race responses, Federal agencies must make available the total number reporting more than one race, if confidentiality and data quality requirements can be met, in order to ensure that any changes in response patterns resulting from the new standards can be monitored over time. Different tabulation procedures might be required to meet various needs of Federal agencies for data on race. Nevertheless, Federal agencies often need to compare racial and ethnic data. Hence, some standardization of tabulation categories for reporting data on race is desirable to facilitate such comparisons.  C  The October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice identified four areas where further research was needed in how to tabulate data under the new standards: 9   (1) (2)  How should the data be used to evaluate conformance with program objectives in the area of equal employment opportunity and other anti-discrimination programs? How should the decennial census data for many small population groups with multiple racial heritages be used to develop sample designs and survey controls for major demographic surveys? How do we introduce the use of the new standards in the vital statistics program which obtains the number of births or deaths from administrative records, but uses intercensal population estimates in determining the rates of births and deaths? And more generally, how can we conduct meaningful comparisons of data collected under the previous standards with those that will be collected under the new standards?  (3)  (4)  In order to address these and other issues and to ensure that tabulation methodologies would be carefully developed and coordinated among the Federal agencies, OMB assembled a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from the Federal agencies that generate or use these data. Over the past year, this group has considered tabulation issues and developed the draft provisional guidance that is presented in this report for use by Federal agencies. The work of this group has included: (1) a review of Federal data needs and uses to ensure that the tabulation guidelines produce data that meet statutory and program requirements; (2) cognitive testing of the wording of questions; (3) development of a form for reporting aggregate data; (4) evaluation of different methods of bridging from the new to the old standards; and (5) development of guidelines for presenting data on multiple race responses that meet accepted data quality and confidentiality standards. The tabulation 2000 data and guidelines will data collected guidance in this report is necessarily provisional pending the availability of Census other data systems as the new collection standards are implemented. These be reviewed and modified as the agencies and other data users gain experience with using the new standards.  C. Points of Clarification Regarding the 1997 Standards A few questions about the new standards have emerged over the past year. This section elaborates on several points in the standards that have been a source of confusion for some users. Under the new standards, ""Hispanic or Latino"" is clearly designated as an ethnicity and not as a race. Whether or not an individual is Hispanic, every effort should be made to ascertain the race or races with which an individual identifies. The two-question format, with the ethnicity question preceding the race question, should be used when information is collected through self-identification. Although the standards permit the use 10   of a combined question when collecting data by observer identification, the use of the twoquestion format is strongly encouraged even where observer identification is used . Regardless of the question format, observers are expected to attempt to identify the individual' s race(s). The standards require that at a minimum the total number of persons identifying with more than one race be reported. It is stressed that this is a minimum; agencies are strongly encouraged to report detailed information on specific racial combinations subject to constraints of data reliability and confidentiality standards. The following wording concerning the reporting of data when the combined question is used is clarified in the paragraph below: ""In cases where data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting ` Hispanic or Latino and one or more races'and the total number of respondents reporting ` more than one race'(regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided."" (Section 2b of the standards) Race by ethnicity always should be reported when confidentiality permits. If not, the first level of collapsing should be ethnicity by the single races and ethnicity for those reporting more than one race. Thus, an Hispanic or Latino respondent reporting one race should be reported both as Hispanic or Latino and as a member of that single race. If the respondent selects more than one race, he or she should be reported in the particular racial combination as well as in the Hispanic or Latino category. Reporting a composite -- that is, the number of people who responded ""Hispanic or Latino"" and more than one race -- is a minimum that only should be used if more detailed reporting would violate data reliability and confidentiality standards. The rules discussed in Section 4 of the new standards concerning the presentation of data on race and ethnicity under special circumstances are not to be invoked unilaterally by an agency. If the agency believes the standard categories are inappropriate, the agency must request a specific variance from OMB. The new standards do not include an ""other race"" category. For the sole purpose of the Census 2000 data collection, OMB has granted an exception to the Census Bureau to use a category called ""Some Other Race."" D. Criteria Used in Developing the Tabulation Guidelines The interagency expert group on tabulations generated criteria that could be used both to evaluate the technical merits of different bridging procedures (See Part V and Appendix D) and to display data under the new standards. The relative importance of each criterion will depend on the purpose for which the data are intended to be used. For example, in the case of bridging to the past, the most important criterion is ""measuring change over time,"" while ""congruence with 11   respect to respondent' choice"" will be more critical for presenting data under the new standards. s The criteria set forth below are designed only to assess the technical adequacy of the various statistical procedures. The first two criteria listed below are central to consideration of bridging methods. The next six criteria apply both to bridging and long-term tabulation decisions. The last criterion is of primary importance for future tabulations of data collected under the new standards. Bridging: Measure change over time. This is the most important criterion for bridging, because the major purpose of any historical bridge will be to measure true change over time as distinct from methodologically induced change. The ideal bridging method, under this criterion, would be one that matches how the respondent would have responded under the old standards had that been possible. In this ideal situation, differences between the new distribution and the old distribution would reflect true change in the distribution itself. Minimize disruptions to the single race distribution. This criterion applies only to methods for bridging. Its purpose is to consider how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the new standards. To the extent that a bridging method can meet the other criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportion in the ongoing distribution, it will facilitate looking both forward and backward in time. Bridging and future tabulations: Range of applicability. Because the purpose of the guidelines is to foster consistency across agencies in tabulating racial and ethnic data, tabulation procedures that can be used in a wide range of programs and varied contexts are usually preferable to those that have more limited applicability. Meet confidentiality and reliability standards. It is essential that the tabulations maintain the confidentiality standards of the statistical organization while producing reliable estimates. Statistically defensible. Because tabulations may be published by statistical agencies and/or provided in public use data, the recommended tabulation procedures should follow recognized statistical practices. Ease of use. Because the tabulation procedures are likely to be used in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they can be implemented with a minimum of operational difficulty. Thus, the tabulation procedures must be capable of being easily replicated by others.  12   Skill required. Similarly, it is important that the tabulation procedures can be implemented by individuals with relatively little statistical knowledge. Understandability and communicability. Again, because the tabulation procedures will likely be used, as well as presented, in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they be easily explainable to the public. Future tabulations: Congruence with respondent' choice. Because of changes in the categories and the s respondent instructions accompanying the question on race (allowing more than one category to be selected), the underlying logic of the tabulation procedures must reflect to the greatest extent possible the full detail of race reporting.  13   II.  COLLECTING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY USING THE NEW STANDARDS  This part of the report currently provides a summary of the Phase I Report on Procedural Implementation of the New Standards for Data on Race and Ethnicity, which is contained in Appendix B. A. Developing Procedures for Data Collection An interagency committee has been continuing past research efforts to develop procedures to collect and aggregate data on race and ethnicity. This research is designed to produce guidelines that address three areas: (1) wording and format of questions that ask for self-reported data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin; (2) wording and format of instructions and forms that collect aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin; and (3) instructions and training procedures for field interviewers and administrative personnel who will be using these questions and forms. Guidelines will be continually reviewed and modified as implementation of the new standards occurs, feedback from agencies is received, and new research findings become available. Members of the procedures committee represent the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, and the General Accounting Office. This summary briefly describes the Phase I research, offers initial guidelines for agencies developing new data collection procedures, and includes a schedule for the completion of work by this committee. The full report of the committee includes the research design and methods, results of Phase I, examples of test questions and forms, and a broader discussion of guidelines and problems identified. Developing and Testing Self-Reported Race and Ethnicity Questions A goal of this research is to provide guidance on the wording and format of questions for selfreporting race and Hispanic or Latino origin depending on the mode of administration. Questions administered by telephone or in a face-to-face personal interview have been tested in cognitive laboratory interviews; self-administered questions are not included in this testing because the Census Bureau previously conducted such research in preparation for Census 2000. To date, 32 cognitive interviews have been completed; another 18 are planned for Phase I and at least 25 more for Phase II. Among the 32 subjects interviewed, 13 reported their race as Black, 3 reported Asian, 2 reported Native Hawaiian, 4 reported more than one race, and 10 reported White, of which 2 also reported Hispanic or Latino origin. No American Indians or Alaska Natives have been interviewed yet in Phase I. Subjects were first asked routine demographic questions as well as the test Hispanic or Latino origin and race questions for themselves and members of their household. Then, debriefings were conducted to learn more about the subjects'understanding of the questions and terms used. 14   Generally, subjects were able to answer without difficulty the race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared but individual differences in the interpretation and meaning of terms used was found, as was confusion regarding the separation of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. As expected, subjects who were interviewed face-to-face seemed to use and rely on the flashcards to select a response. Subjects interviewed by telephone had a bit more difficulty answering the race questions since they had to listen to a relatively long list of response options. Also, there was some evidence that the instruction to ""...select one or more..."" was misunderstood on the telephone to mean that the subject had to select more than one race. Section 1 in Appendix B describes in detail the results of testing the questions on race and ethnicity. Based on these interviews, the following initial guidelines for the design of questions on race and ethnicity are offered: C C C Communicate clearly an instruction that allows, but does not require, multiple responses to the race question. Consider using an instruction to answer both the Hispanic or Latino origin question and the race question. For data collection efforts requiring detailed Hispanic or Latino origin or detailed race information, consider options to collect further information through write-in entries or follow-up questions asked by the interviewer. Take mode of administration carefully into account when designing questions and instructions. Provide definitions to the minimum race categories when possible. Adhere to the specific terminology as stated in the October 30, 1997, standards.  C C C  Developing and Testing Aggregate Reporting Forms Implementing the revised standards will cause fundamental changes to the ways in which data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin have previously been aggregated and reported. Therefore, a second goal of this research is to provide guidance on the design of reporting forms that will be used by administrative personnel to aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin for a given population (e.g., reporting race and ethnicity for a school population). Twenty cognitive interviews are planned for this phase of the research. Three different forms are being tested with subjects who are familiar with reporting aggregate data for a given population, 15   but not necessarily familiar with the revised standards. Fourteen interviews have been completed thus far, 7 in cognitive laboratories and 7 on-site. Of the 14 respondents interviewed, 5 worked for the Federal Government, 6 worked in private industry, 2 worked in local correctional facilities, and 1 worked in a school. For the laboratory testing, subjects were given ` dummy'records of applications that contained multiple race responses as well as combined Hispanic or Latino origin and race questions. For the on-site interviews, subjects referred to agency data. None of the forms tested were completed accurately without interviewer intervention. Regardless of the form tested or whether the testing was conducted in a laboratory or on-site, the most common problem was the requirement to count and report race for individuals who are of Hispanic or Latino origin. As an illustration, one subject stated ""It' (the form) basically asking s how Hispanics were separated into groups of races. I think the part that confuses me is that our Hispanics do not view themselves as another race. And so that is kind of what threw me off... it' asking for Hispanics who had marked ` s White,'but they don' They would have checked t. Hispanic."" Discussions with subjects revealed that all but one worked for agencies that have used the single question -- combined race and ethnicity format -- to collect data. Several methodological problems also emerged and will be corrected prior to further testing. They are discussed in detail in Appendix B, Section 2. Even though there were many problems found in developing and testing aggregate forms, some initial guidelines can be put forth at this time. C C C C If possible, allow for the reporting of every combination of multiple race responses. Provide definitions that assist in understanding the concepts of single race reports and multiple race reports as well as the distinction between ethnicity and race. Explain how the missing data should be reported. Professionally design the form and include clear instructions.  Development of Field Instructions and Training Procedures Work to develop interviewer instructions and interviewer training procedures will begin in the Spring of 1999. Plans include developing and testing different training modules and interviewer instructions, depending on the mode of administration and the type of data collection. This work will, in all likelihood, not address new issues or problems. However, since the new standards do encompass several distinct changes, it seems timely to address in a more systematic way some longstanding issues in the fielding of the questions, and ways that interviewers can be trained to improve data quality. Specific procedures on how to ask the questions and, in some cases, how to instruct the respondent to use the flashcard, will be developed along with suggested interviewer 16   probes, definitions, and statements that can be used to answer respondent questions. Schedule Phase I was ongoing through 1998 and will be completed at the beginning of April 1999. Phase II will begin in April 1999 and will be completed by the end of July 1999. A final report encompassing both phases should be available by the end of September 1999.  17   B. Best Practices in Survey Design and Data Processing (Under development)  18   III.  TABULATING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY COLLECTED USING THE NEW STANDARDS  This part of the report describes options for tabulating data on race and ethnicity collected under the new standards to meet various Federal needs for these data. A. Decennial Census The Census 2000 questionnaire will provide individuals the opportunity to self-report their racial identity by selecting one or more races. For purposes of Census 2000 only, in an effort to encourage response to this question, OMB has approved the use of a sixth category -- ""Some Other Race"" -- in addition to the minimum five categories. This discussion covers preliminary tabulations plans for the six categories of race and the two categories of ethnicity (""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino"") and for possible combinations of these racial and ethnic categories. It does not address tabulation plans for detailed groups of American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander populations for which information will be collected in Census 2000. For data from the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal sites, table shells will be available on the Internet through the Census Bureau' American FactFinder. The data user will be able to use the inquiry s system in the American FactFinder to obtain table shells filled with data for user-selected geographic areas and for population universes defined by race and ethnicity down to the census tract level. The amount of data on population characteristics available in table shells will be roughly the same as in printed reports in 1990 for counties and for places of 10,000 or more population. Protection of Confidentiality in Data from Census 2000 To maintain confidentiality as required by law (Title 13, United States Code), the Census Bureau uses a confidentiality edit to ensure that published data do not disclose information about specific individuals, households, and housing units. The result is that a small amount of uncertainty is introduced into some of the census data to prevent identification of specific individuals, households, or households. As with data from the 1990 census, a confidentiality edit will be implemented for data from Census 2000 by selecting a sample of census households from internal census files and interchanging their data with data from other households that have identical numbers of household members, but that are in different locations within the same state. The net result of this procedure is that the data user' ability to obtain census data is increased, particularly for small geographic s areas and small population groups.  19   Approach for Tabulations by Race and Ethnicity for Census 2000 The proposed approach reflects OMB' preliminary guidelines (See Part I, Section B) on s tabulations by race and ethnicity. The discussion of the approach includes data on both population totals for racial and ethnic categories and on population characteristics (e.g., age and sex) for racial and ethnic categories. Before describing preliminary plans for tabulations by race and ethnicity, it is helpful to describe both the maximum number of racial and/or ethnic categories for which data could be provided and some of the other racial and/or ethnic categories for which data could be provided. There are 63 potential single and multiple race categories, including 6 categories for those who marked exactly one race and 57 categories for those who marked two or more races. These 57 categories of two or more races include the 15 possible combinations of two races (for example, Asian and White), the 20 possible combinations of three races, the 15 possible combinations of four races, the 6 possible combinations of five races, and the 1 possible combination of all six races. There are two ethnic categories (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Thus there are 126 categories (63 x 2) in which the population could be classified by both race and ethnicity. The 63 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories of race may be collapsed down to 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories by combining the 57 categories of two or more races. These 7 categories are: White alone, Black or African American alone, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Asian alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, Some other race alone, and Two or more races. Alternative groupings for tabulations by race reflect OMB' preliminary guidelines to show ""the s total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination."" In combination literally means ""in combination with one or more other races."" In this ""all-inclusive"" approach, tabulations would be shown for each of six categories, which will overlap and will add to more than the total population to the extent that individuals report more than one race. These six categories are: White alone or in combination, Black or African American alone or in combination, American Indian and Alaska Native alone or in combination, Asian alone or in combination, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone or in combination, and Some Other Race alone or in combination. As in the case of the 63 racial categories, both tabulations by race of the 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories and tabulations by race alone or in combination could be classified by ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Because of concerns about the usefulness and reliability of data on population characteristics for small populations, about issues with respect to confidentiality, and about providing data products 20   so voluminous that most data cell values would be zero, the Census Bureau is planning (as it has in previous censuses) to present more detail by race and ethnicity for population totals than for population characteristics. For example, Census 2000 data products might show a population total for a specific racial or ethnic group (e.g., 50) in a small geographic area, but not show data on characteristics such as household relationship, education, income, and tenure for this racial or ethnic group. Preliminary plans for tabulations by race and ethnicity for population totals and for population characteristics are discussed in the following two sections. The amount of detail shown in tabulations by race and ethnicity in data products from Census 2000 will vary with the purpose and size of each product. Planned tabulations for population totals by race and ethnicity from four data products are discussed: the Public Law 94-171 file (which is a 100-percent data product), the 100-percent demographic profile, the 100-percent summary file, and 100-percent table shells. Planned tabulations for population characteristics by race and ethnicity are discussed together for the 100-percent and sample summary files and the 100-percent and sample table shells. (The 100-percent data products are based on data collected on all questionnaires. In comparison, sample data products are based on data collected only on long-form questionnaires.) As noted above, this discussion does not discuss tabulation plans for detailed groups of American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander populations. It may be noted, however, that tabulations for these detailed categories will not be included on the PL 94-171 file, but will be included in the other Census 2000 data products listed in the preceding paragraph. Population Totals: Preliminary Plans for Data by Race and Ethnicity from Census 2000 Public Law (PL) 94-171 Redistricting File. PL 94-171 requires that the Census Bureau work closely with the ""officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting of each state"" to determine the specific tabulations needed from the decennial census. Tabulations planned for this file are based on meetings and communications with the Redistricting Task Force of the National Conference of State Legislatures and stateappointed liaisons of the governors and legislatures. During this process, senior officials from OMB, the Voting Rights Section of the Department of Justice, and the Census Bureau consulted with the Task Force and state legislative officials. The PL 94-171 file will include population totals down to the block level. The racial and ethnic categories that the Census Bureau plans to include in the matrices (one-dimensional statistical tables) on the PL 94-171 file are combined into one table outline and presented in Table 1. (The PL 94-171 file also includes data on the population 18 years and over for each of these racial or ethnic categories.) From tabulations for the racial and ethnic categories shown in Table 1, it is possible also to obtain tabulations by subtraction for the Hispanic or Latino population by race (total minus Not Hispanic 21   or Latino) and for the population in a racial category in combination only (e.g., Asian alone or in combination minus Asian alone). The PL 94-171 file will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. A paper listing of data from the PL 94-171 file, to be provided to officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting of each state, will include about one-half of the tabulations shown above. The paper listing will not include tabulations for Race alone or in combination, or for Race not alone or in combination. 100-Percent Demographic Profile. This profile is designed to provide for geographic areas down to the census tract level an overview of 100-percent census data on a one-page table that includes data on all population and housing topics for which data are collected on a 100-percent basis: sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household relationship, and housing occupancy and tenure. Given the limited amount of space to show data on each topic, population totals by race and ethnicity will be limited. Population totals will be shown for each of the major races alone, for two or more races, and for each major race alone or in combination (as described earlier), but will not be shown for the 57 specific categories of two or more races. 100-Percent Summary File. This file, which is the most detailed 100-percent data product planned, will include some population totals on race and ethnicity down to the block level and additional population totals on race and ethnicity down only to the census tract level. The racial and ethnic categories that the Census Bureau plans to include down to the block level in the matrices on the 100-percent summary file are combined into one table outline and presented in Table 2. The additional categories that are included down only to the census tract level in the 100-percent summary file are the 57 individual categories of two or more races crossed by the two ethnic categories (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). These racial and ethnic categories are combined into one table outline and presented in Table 3. 100-Percent Table Shells. Table shells represent a new data product for Census 2000. A table shell is a one-page table outline with a fixed stub and boxhead (for example, showing population by age and sex). Table shells are supported by summary files in the same way that data in various printed reports in 1990 were supported by summary tape files (STFs). Population Characteristics: Preliminary Plans for Data by Race and Ethnicity from Census 2000 100-Percent and Sample Summary Files and Table Shells. Plans for tabulations of population characteristics by race and ethnicity from the 100-percent and sample summary tables and from the 100-percent and sample table shells are discussed together here because the Census Bureau plans to show population characteristics for the same list of racial and ethnic groups in all of these data products. 22   In the case of summary files, population characteristics in the matrices on the files would be iterated (repeated) for each racial or ethnic category. This corresponds to the ""B"" matrices in summary tape files (STFs) 2 and 4 in 1990 census data products in which the ""B"" matrices were iterated for each of a list of racial and ethnic categories. In the case of table shells, population characteristics would be available for each of the racial and ethnic categories for which population characteristics are available on the summary files. The user of table shells will be able to select from a list of topics (e.g., age and sex) and then select the geographic area (e.g., state, county, place) and population universe (i.e., the racial or ethnic category) to obtain the data desired. The scope of data available using table shells is limited to data on summary files (in the same way that data in printed reports in 1990 were limited to data on summary files). Table shells will present subsets of more detailed data from the summary files in user-friendly formats (like tables in printed reports), and will show totals, subtotals, and derived measures that are not included on the summary files. The list of 27 racial and ethnic categories for which the Census Bureau plans to show population characteristics in aggregated data products (as opposed to what is available from microdata files, as discussed below) in Census 2000 is presented in Table 4. From tabulations for the list of racial and ethnic categories shown in Table 4, it is possible also to obtain tabulations by subtraction for the Hispanic or Latino population by race (total minus Not Hispanic or Latino), for the population in a racial category in combination only (e.g., Asian alone or in combination minus Asian alone), and for the complement to an all-inclusive group (e.g., total minus Asian alone or in combination). Micro data files. Tabulations on population characteristics by race and ethnicity described above are limited to what is planned for aggregated data products. In addition, the Census Bureau will produce 5-percent public-use microdata files (PUMS), as was done in 1990, which will permit users to obtain tabulations for any racial or ethnic group for which data were collected in the census. (This would include, for example, any of the 57 categories of more than one race.) In 1990, in addition to the confidentiality edit described earlier, the PUMS files were stripped of names and address, the order of records was rearranged on the file, and a minimum population threshold of 100,000 was used. In addition, and subject to the Census Bureau' strict confidentiality standards, the Census Bureau s plans to make available on the Internet through the American FactFinder, the microdata files that underlie the 100-percent and sample summary files for Census 2000 so that data users can create tabulations to their own specifications. These microdata files are the 100-percent edited detail file (HEDF) and the sample edited detail file (SEDF). The full microdata files will be made available to data users only in the form of PUMS files, as described above. If a data user wants data on population characteristics for a racial or ethnic group for which characteristics are not available in the summary files or table shells and for a geographic area for which a PUMS file is not available, it will be possible -- again, subject to strict confidentiality standards set by the Census Bureau -- to obtain these data in the American FactFinder with a 23   custom tabulation from the HEDF or the SEDF. For example, the data user will be able to obtain population characteristics for one of the 57 categories of more than one race (e.g., White and Asian). Because of the strict confidentiality standards, the quantity of data that can be obtained will depend on several factors, including the geographic area, the size of the population universe (e.g., the number of individuals who are Asian and White), and the extent of the characteristics detail (number of data cells in a table showing population characteristics).  24   Table 1.

Other Surveys and Administrative Records This section applies to the presentation of data collected under the new standards through surveys and administrative records. Although these proposed tabulation guidelines are particularly applicable in the near term, they also provide a framework that can be expanded in the future as it becomes possible to present more data on multiple race responses. In general, data should be presented in as much detail as possible (thereby satisfying the criteria congruence with respondent' choice), subject to satisfying agency criteria for statistical reliability and s confidentiality (satisfying the criteria meet confidentiality and reliability standards.) Thus, data on multiple race responses should be presented in as much detail as possible given sample sizes and sample designs. In addition, to the extent possible, Federal agencies should report data using standardized categories to facilitate comparisons across subject-matter areas and data systems, thus satisfying the criteria range of applicability, statistical defensibility, and understandability and communicability. The decision to revise the policy for the collection of data on race reflects the increasing complexity of our Nation' demographics. As a result, the ways that data on race are tabulated s and analyzed also will become more complex. The proposed guidelines in this section reflect this complexity. The tabulation strategies illustrated here have simple structures, hence they satisfy the criteria ease of use and skill required. Examples of tabulation strategies are provided and illustrated using data collected as part of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to report more than one race, but has also asked respondents to indicate the single race with which they most closely identified. The data on race from this survey have been retabulated for illustrative purposes to be as comparable as possible to the categories in the 1997 standards. (Unless otherwise noted, the tables in this section are based on data combined from three years of NHIS data. The resulting larger sample size improves the reliability of the estimates and enables more categories to be shown. However, even when combining three years of data on race, counts for some categories cannot be shown due to small sample sizes.) As noted above, agencies are to provide as much detail as possible while adhering to their own standards for data quality and confidentiality. Under a typical data quality standard, a table cell cannot be published if its relative standard error (or other measure of dispersion) is larger than some value specified by the agency. In such a situation, the data cell is not published separately, but the cell value is included in subtotals. Under a confidentiality standard, a cell value must be suppressed (withheld from publication) if knowledge of the cell value might enable someone to gain knowledge about one of the respondents contributing data to the cell. If a cell is suppressed to preserve confidentiality, other cells must also be suppressed so the cell value cannot be derived by subtraction. This is called ""complementary suppression."" (The reader may wish to refer to Statistical Policy Working Paper 22: Report on Statistical Disclosure Limitation Methodology for more information concerning 29   the definition of sensitive cells and the selection of cells for complementary suppression.) Agencies do not use a common set of standards for evaluating confidentiality and quality issues. To illustrate the application of agency standards that affect the cells that can be shown in tables only a data quality standard is used here. A table cell has been arbitrarily classified as failing the data quality standard if the sample size is smaller than 0.2 percent of the population for all but Table C. To illustrate a table that might result from a smaller sample survey, in Table C a table cell is classified as failing the data quality standard if the sample size is smaller than 2.0 percent of the population. These admittedly arbitrary criteria are used to illustrate what might be published from a large sample survey, and to illustrate the distributions that may result from the implementation of the new standards. Note that since the only data being displayed in this report are population counts, it is possible to show more data cells than would be the case if the table presented attributes (income, education, health outcomes, etc.) of these groups. Individual survey systems will make decisions as to what data can be shown based on the characteristics of each system and the confidentiality and reliability guidelines established for that data system. Two types of responses cannot be tabulated into the categories identified in the standard. The first is when no information on race was provided. In this report the heading ""Race Not Reported"" is used for this type of response. This response type can be further subdivided according to the reason that no information was obtained -- refusal, don' know, and not t ascertained. The second is when a response was received that does not match any of the standard racial categories. Such responses are tabulated using the heading ""Other Race."" A third heading, ""Not Tabulated Above"" is used to include either single or more than one race categories that are specified in the standard, but are not large enough to be published separately. For illustrative purposes, these three headings are used in the tables in this section. Not all statistical publications will use this model. Strategies for tabulating these kinds of responses will follow agency policy and the analytic objectives of the report. A remaining issue to be addressed by Federal agencies is that the rules used in editing and imputing respondents'data on race and ethnicity will affect the racial distributions derived from Federal surveys and administrative records. As noted elsewhere in this report, rules for editing and imputation of data on race and ethnicity should be an area of further research and collaboration for Federal agencies, to ensure that the data reported are as comparable as possible. Since the objective of this section is to illustrate different tabulation strategies, categories with frequencies too small to be shown will not be treated the same way in all of the tables. In some tables, the category is not shown at all and the cell value is included under ""Not Tabulated Above""; in other tables, the category is retained in order to clarify the structure of the table but data are replaced by a ""Q"" to illustrate that they have been withheld from publication for data quality considerations. When the data are replaced by ""Q,"" a footnote is used to describe the reason the data are not shown.  30   In all tables in this section, the ""More Than One Race"" heading includes respondents who selected more than one of the five basic racial categories in the new standard. Many data collection systems obtain information on a more detailed set of responses. When surveys collect more detailed information on race than the minimum standard, some persons may indicate that they identify with more than one of the more detailed groups. For example, within the Asian group, respondents might indicate that they are of Chinese and Japanese heritage. These respondents would not be included in the ""More Than One Race"" heading but would be included in the total for Asians. If sample size permits, an additional Asian sub-category could be used to indicate the number of individuals who marked more than one of the detailed Asian categories. Table A illustrates the fundamental goal of the new standard and provides a detailed set of categories for tabulating data on race. Table A displays the five single categories, and also includes more detail on the Asian subgroups; it also displays a number of multiple-response categories. Based on NHIS data, the most frequently marked race combinations are American Indian and White, Asian and White, and Black and White. In other situations, the categories used to present data would be a function of the overall sample size and the regional characteristics of the population where the sample is selected. Whatever detailed categories are presented, they should support recreating the minimum basic set of racial categories. Table B shows a category for each of the five single racial groups in the new standards as well as a ""More Than One Race"" heading. It is an example of a table that can be used when sample sizes do not permit the presentation of greater detail. In this table, data are not shown separately for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, one of the single race categories in the collection standard, since they comprise less than 0.2 percent of the U.S. population. However, since this is the only category that cannot be shown both the number and the percent for the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander group are readily obtained by subtraction. This is an example of a data cell that is being suppressed for data quality concerns. If it were suppressed for confidentiality concerns, another cell would also have to be suppressed to prevent the cell value from being obtained by subtraction. As was the case under the 1977 standard, it will often not be possible to tabulate data using all of the categories used to collect the information. Even with three years of data from the NHIS, Tables A and B could not present data for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders because they total less than 0.2 percent of the population. If data for one or more of the five minimum racial categories fail the requirements for data quality or confidentiality, standard agency products should include them in an aggregation such as ""Not Tabulated Above,"" rather than combining them with categories that are publishable alone. For example, if the data for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders cannot be published separately, these data should not be combined with data in the Asian category (except when such combinations are needed for comparability with data collected under the old standard). Instead, the data on Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders should be included in the total and either omitted from the detailed tabulations completely, replaced with a symbol and footnoted as in Tables A and B, or included in a separate heading for all groups not specifically tabulated (i.e., under the Not Tabulated Above heading.) 31   This last approach is illustrated in Table C. For this table, only one year' NHIS data are used, s and data are reported only for categories that comprise at least 2 percent of the population. This is intended to provide an illustration of what might happen when total sample sizes are smaller and data from fewer categories can be reliably presented. Because the Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, More Than One Race, and Race Not Reported respondents each comprise less than 2 percent of the population, these categories were not listed separately in Table C but were included both in the Total and the Not Tabulated Above rows. In order to display as much data as possible as well as to reflect the complexity of reporting on race, some additional categories may be tabulated and reported along with the basic tabulations. These categories may not be mutually exclusive but would combine categories to create useful analytic distinctions. For example, a heading could be created for persons reporting that they are Asian whether as a single race or in combination with any other race(s). Parallel categories could be created for any of the five single racial categories. The resulting counts are called ""all inclusive."" They form distributions for each individual racial group; that is, the sum of the percent of respondents who mark a particular group alone, the percent who mark that group and at least one other group, and the percent who did not mark that group is 100 percent. The all inclusive distributions may provide information on population groups that might not have sufficient size in the sample to be included in basic tabulations. Table D provides a suggested tabulation strategy. Three years of NHIS data are used for this Table, and the 0.2 percent cutoff is used to determine whether data can be shown. The all inclusive NHOPI category does not meet the criteria for inclusion (0.2 percent of the population) and is not shown. Note that when the tabulation involves counts or percentages, the analyst can subtract the count or percentage for each single race from the all inclusive count or percentage to obtain the count of individuals reporting each race in combination with any other race(s). For example, the Black or African American all inclusive count minus the Black or African American single race count will yield a count for those reporting Black or African American in combination with one or more other races. This would not be possible if the tabulation included summary statistics (mean, median, or percent) for attributes such as income, education or health outcomes. Tables A - D describe tabulation alternatives for data on race collected using the new standards. The new standards also affect the collection and reporting of data on Hispanic or Latino origin. The new standards call for asking a question on Hispanic or Latino origin followed by a question on race but also allows under limited circumstances for a single, combined question where Hispanic or Latino origin is included in a list along with the five standard racial categories. In the combined question, respondents are also instructed to ""mark one or more."" In either case, Hispanic origin may be reported alone or in combination with one or more races. As was the case for the tabulation of data on race, data on Hispanic or Latino ethnicity can also be presented for specific subgroups (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican) as shown in Table E. The tabulation headings used will be a function of the overall sample size and the population composition where the sample is selected.  32   Even when separate questions are used to collect data on Hispanic or Latino origin and race, there are applications where a cross tabulation of the data from these two survey questions is preferred. Whether data are collected using the single question or the two question format, education and health data are frequently reported with racial data for Hispanics or Latinos as a separate group along with racial data for non-Hispanics or non-Latinos. Data collected under the new standards using either format will support the analysis of data on both Hispanics or Latinos and non-Hispanics or non-Latinos by race (Table F). For example, Table F shows that among Hispanics or Latinos, the sample size permits the presentation of data for Blacks, Whites, those of ""other"" races, and those selecting more than one race. Tabulations which incorporate the Hispanic or Latino subgroup information can be developed by expanding Table F. Since respondents are free to select one or more categories in the combined format, data collected from a survey or administrative reporting where a combined format is used can also be tabulated using Tables E or F.  33   Table A.

USING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY COLLECTED UNDER THE NEW STANDARDS  This part of the report discusses some important uses of data under the new standards, reflecting in large measure work that is ongoing. A. Redistricting One of the first official statutory uses of data on race and ethnicity collected under the new standards will be for legislative redistricting following Census 2000. The new data format should not require substantial changes in the way redistricting will be conducted. How the 1990 Census Racial and Ethnic Data Were Used The 1990 census Public Law 94-171 (""redistricting count"") tabulations (which were released to the states for redistricting purposes) reported data down to the block level for the total population and the voting age population (ages 18 years and older) for four racial groups (American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and White) and a residual category (""other"" race). Data on these racial groups were also cross-tabulated by Hispanic origin. Categories were mutually exclusive (each person was counted only once), and the categories added to the total population reported for a geographic region. States and political subdivisions that are covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act are required to demonstrate, to the United States Attorney General or to a Federal district court in the District of Columbia, that their redistricting plans will not reduce the voting strength of their minority citizens and that the plans do not have a racially discriminatory purpose. All states and political subdivisions, however, are prohibited by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act from using redistricting plans that have the effect of diluting their resident' voting strength on account of s race. The U.S. Department of Justice or private citizens may file lawsuits to enforce these laws. In order to comply with those Federal laws, states and their political subdivisions used the redistricting count tabulations to assess the racial and ethnic compositions and distributions of their residents as they drew their redistricting plans. The data were used to identify areas in which racial and ethnic minorities were residentially segregated, in order, for example, to avoid splintering those areas among several districts. The data also were used in some areas to determine whether voting patterns were racially polarized. After the redistricting process was complete, courts would rely on the redistricting count data, together with other evidence, to decide any legal challenge that was filed against the redistricting plan. How the 2000 Census Data Can Be Used for Redistricting in 2001 In Census 2000 the major changes to the reporting of data on race and ethnicity are (1) the instruction to ""mark one or more"" racial categories and (2) the splitting of the ""Asian or Pacific 41   Islander"" category into two separate categories -- ""Asian"" and ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander."" Hispanic or Latino origin will be ascertained in a separate question, as in 1990 census. For the purposes of the 2000 Census Dress Rehearsal, the Census Bureau will provide tabulations of the number of persons who identified with only one of the five individual racial categories or with the residual category (""single race"" counts), plus tabulations of the total number of persons who identified with each of the five individual racial categories either alone (e.g., White only) or in combination with any other categories (e.g., White plus any other racial category), referred to as ""all inclusive"" counts. Both the ""single race"" counts and the ""all inclusive"" counts will be cross-tabulated by Hispanic or Latino origin. It should be noted that the ""all inclusive"" counts will add to more than 100 percent of the population since a person' response will be counted in all of s the racial categories selected. (See Appendix C for more information on Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal prototype redistricting data.) It is not expected that provision of the redistricting count data in the new format will lead to significant changes in redistricting practices or decisions. The new data categories will not affect the total population counts used for the apportionment of Congress, or for compliance with oneperson, one-vote requirements. Once the Dress Rehearsal data are released and analyzed, there will be more information available about the practical effects of the new standards. It can be expected that the more that the singlecount and all-inclusive-count populations share the same residential patterns, the less likely it will be that jurisdictions'redistricting choices will affect those populations differently. Research also has indicated that, at least nationwide, there is unlikely to be a significant difference between the ""single count"" Black population and the ""all-inclusive"" Black population. In addition, jurisdictions with substantial Hispanic or Latino populations will have a separate count of all persons identifying themselves as Hispanic or Latino, because ethnicity is collected in a separate question. Alternatives to the single-race/all-inclusive approach to redistricting data are under consideration. The U. S. Department of Justice has not yet reached a decision on the question of whether advantages would result from the use of one of the allocation methods described in Appendix D for voting rights issues. While allocation does not conform with the criterion that data uses should reflect ""congruence with respondent' choice,"" it would facilitate comparisons with the s 1990 census data. (Allocation methods assign an individual' multiple race response to a single s race category.) Some have suggested that an allocation approach would have the advantage of giving redistricting authorities, the states and their political subdivisions, one number to use in making their redistricting choices. Others have suggested that instead it would require states to use and consider three data sets: single-race counts, all-inclusive counts, and the allocated counts. If a decision is made to use an allocation approach, the Department of Justice would discuss with the Census Bureau the technical feasibility of including matrices using the chosen allocation method in the PL 94-171 data files or producing a special tabulation with such data after the Census Bureau has met its legal deadline of April 1, 2001, for producing the data specified in PL 94-171. The working group would appreciate feedback from users on these issues. 42   B. Equal Employment Opportunity One of the Federal Government' most significant uses of data on race and ethnicity is in its s efforts to ensure that every individual has an equal opportunity for employment. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination in employment based upon race, color, sex, religion, and national origin. Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, similarly prohibits discrimination in employment by government contractors. Executive Order 11246 also requires contractors covered by its provisions to ensure affirmatively that they do not discriminate against their employees and applicants for employment. Responsibility for equal employment opportunity is shared among a number of Federal agencies including: the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Justice, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in the Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Department of Education. Title VII is enforced by the EEOC against private employers and by the Department of Justice against state and local government employers. Executive Order 11246 is enforced by the OFCCP. Representatives from these agencies 1997 standards for reporting of data data related activities carried out by used, the changes the agencies have under discussion. have been meeting to determine how best to implement the on race and ethnicity. This section describes some of the the agencies, how the data were previously collected and agreed upon, and some of the alternatives that are currently  As the new standards are implemented, agencies whose primary mission is civil rights enforcement will face particularly complex challenges. The EEO agencies will continue to consider the burden imposed on those responding to data requests as they make various tabulation, aggregation, and other decisions. All participants in these important decisions are reminded that it is not the intent of the 1997 standards to diminish the availability and quality of information collected and available for Federal civil rights enforcement and related purposes. Data Needs and Uses There are two basic theories of employment discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate impact. Disparate treatment can either affect individuals because of their protected characteristics, or in pattern and practice cases, it can affect all persons in the group who have an employment relationship with that employer. Individual disparate treatment cases rely primarily on evidence of how an individual was treated in comparison to other similarly situated individuals. In some instances, statistical evidence of disparities in treatment between similarly situated individuals can suggest that some individuals were subject to employment discrimination because of their protected class status. In disparate impact cases, statistics on the number of available and qualified minority workers for 43   a particular job are compared with statistics on the employer' workforce. Enforcement agencies s compare statistics on the racial breakdown of an employer' workforce to the racial composition s of the available qualified labor pool. These analyses also consider statistics on the jobholder' s employment-related characteristics, such as educational attainment or occupational experience, compared with similar data on those persons qualified for, and interested in, the at-issue jobs. This analysis is the first step in determining whether there is reason to believe that the employer' s selection procedures improperly excluded individuals on the basis of their race, ethnicity, or gender. After this analysis, the employer may be asked to show that its selection procedures for the position(s) in question are job-related and consistent with business necessity. The workforce data often come from the employer' annual reports filed with Federal agencies (see ""Data on s Employer' Workforce"" below), and the benchmark data come from a special file covering EEOs related data drawn from the most recent decennial census (see ""The Benchmark File"" below.) In some disparate impact cases, the selection or de-selection rates of different groups within the employer' workforce are compared without reference to external benchmarks. s Data on Employer' Work Force. Data on an employer' workforce are collected annually on s s the Employer Information Reports (EEO-1 and EEO-4 surveys) covering private and state or local government employment, respectively, and on the EEO-5 and IPEDS (formerly EEO-6) surveys of employment in elementary/secondary and higher education, respectively. The current EEO forms collect general information about the employer and its workforce. Employers provide counts of employees within nine job categories by gender and five racial/ethnic categories (White-not of Hispanic origin, Black--not of Hispanic origin, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native) for each facility. The Benchmark File. In 1990, a special EEO file based on the decennial census data was produced by the Census Bureau, in accordance with specifications provided by the EEO agencies. It included five matrices of counts for various geographic entities including the United States, States, metropolitan areas, counties, and places of 50,000 or more in population. The five tables presented various cross-tabulations of the number of people in each labor force category by gender, EEO racial/ethnic categories (six categories, the five noted above plus ""other, not of Hispanic origin""), occupation (512 categories), industry (98 categories), educational attainment (six categories), earnings (9 categories) or age (seven categories). Summary of Data Use for EEO Analysis. The basic inquiry requires identification of the relevant labor force for each case, followed by a determination as to whether the employer' work s force differs to a statistically significant extent from the benchmark comparison group. The relevant labor force depends on the employment action at issue. For entry-level positions that require few skills or experience, the benchmark may be some lesser skilled subset of the civilian labor force in the geographic area in which the employer operates. Depending on the qualifications required for a position, the relevant labor force may be further delineated, for example, by age, education, or occupation. For promotions, the relevant labor pool typically will be the employees eligible for the promotion. The basic inquiry is always the same: is the number/percent of, for example, Blacks, found in the employer' work force significantly s 44   different from the number of Blacks that would be expected to be found based on the percentage of qualified and interested Blacks in the labor force. The comparative information on the labor force generally comes from the benchmark file from the most recent decennial census. The wide range of factors, e.g. qualifications, availability, location, affecting employment decisions by both employers and individual workers influences whether the employer' work s force will replicate the availability of individuals at any level of labor force aggregation. Absent discriminatory practices, it is also unlikely that significant disparities should exist between the proportion of qualified minority or female workers in positions throughout the employer' work s force and the available and qualified labor pool. Statistical analysis measures the disparity between the actual participation of minorities or women in the employer' workforce and their expected representation to determine whether any disparity s can be attributed to chance. The analysis is based on an assumption that available and qualified minorities and women are recruited, apply and are selected on a nondiscriminatory basis by the employer. Following statistical practice, if the likelihood of chance differences is less than 0.05 (the five percent probability significance level), regulatory agencies and the courts generally accept the alternative inference that unlawful factors may have influenced employer' decision making. In s litigation, this inference can constitute a prima facie showing of discrimination, which then requires the employer to explain its practices or face liability. In several cases, the Supreme Court accepted the use of a statistic approximating the five percent probability level, a two-three standard deviation difference, but emphasized that a range of techniques can be used to reflect the fact patterns of each case. See Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 311 n. 17 (1977), and Watson v. Ft. Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 995 n.3 (1988). The following example illustrates the statistical comparison of the racial profile of an employer' s workforce and the racial profile of similar job-holders in that employer' labor market area. In this s example, the ABC Corporation, a large producer of computer software in City X, employs 350 programmers. Eleven, or 3.2 percent of these programmers are Black. Using the decennial census benchmark data, it is found that Blacks constitute 3.72 percent of available programmers working in City X. Using that benchmark proportion, the expected number of Black programmers in a company in City X with 350 programmers is found to be 13 (3.72 percent times 350). The difference between the number of Black programmers in ABC Corporation and the number expected is minus 2 (11 minus 13). In ""standard deviation1"" terms, the disparity (-2/350) is -.57 standard deviations. Such a difference, while negative, is not statistically significant (to be statistically significant, it would need to be less than -1.96). Thus, the number of Black computer programmers employed by the ABC Corporation is not suggestive The standard deviation is computed as sqrt(p(1-p)/n), where p is the fraction from the benchmark file, and n is the number of employees in the company. 45 1   of an under representation of Black programmers in the employer' workforce. s Changes Needed to EEO Forms and Instructions to Meet the New Standards Employer Record-keeping. The instructions accompanying the current EEO forms state that the race and ethnicity of an employer's work force may be obtained either by ""visual surveys of the work force, or from post-employment records."" The instructions state explicitly that eliciting information from the employee via direct inquiry is not encouraged. With the implementation of the 1997 standards, this guidance will change. Self-identification will be the preferred method of collecting data on race and ethnicity from employees. Employers will also be encouraged to use the two-question format with Hispanic ethnicity first, and to allow those employees who wish to do so to select more than one race. Employers will be asked to maintain this information in their data files. It is currently thought that employers will not be required to resurvey current staff, although some will likely do so. If employers do not resurvey current staff, the data available to be collected on the EEO forms will only slowly become comparable to the benchmark data reported in Census 2000. The OFCCP regulations do not specify how Federal contractors (employers) should gather the data necessary to complete the work force analysis or the utilization analysis for Affirmative Action Programs. The implementing regulations, however, require the filing of an EEO-1 report and, by implication, the data reported in the work force utilization analysis must be consistent with the EEO-1 reporting requirements. Planned Changes to the EEO Forms. To be consistent with the new standards, the following changes to the EEO forms are planned: (1) (2) Add a separate category ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"" to EEO forms and instructions, and replace the category ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" with ""Asian."" Make a. b. c. the following changes in terminology: The term ""Eskimo or Aleut"" replaced by ""Alaska Native,"" The term ""Black"" replaced by ""Black or African-American,"" and The term ""Hispanic"" replaced by ""Hispanic or Latino.""  (3)  Capture Hispanic or Latino ethnicity in a separate category or question.  These planned changes do not incorporate a change of instructions to ""mark one or more races."" It has not yet been determined how best to revise the forms that collect aggregations of data about the employer' workforce to account for individuals who report more than one race. s Efforts to date to design and test an aggregate reporting form are discussed earlier in this report. Alternatives for using the data for EEO purposes (that might lead to changes in the EEO forms) are described below.  46   Ensuring Common Approaches in EEO Reporting The Federal civil rights enforcement agencies agree that they should adopt common data base definitions for the racial and ethnic categories used to enforce EEO laws and regulations. Clearly, whatever system is adopted, the enforcement agencies will need to consider the complex issues related to implementing the new standards, bridging to EEO enforcement conducted using data collected under the old standard, and continuing to conduct the important business of ensuring equal employment opportunity during the transition years. Because of the complexities in collecting and using the data reported under the new standards for civil rights enforcement purposes, the EEO agencies are still in the process of considering the best way to analyze these data. A number of alternative approaches are currently under review. Three alternatives are briefly described in the following sections. Each alternative would require the preparation of a suitable decennial census benchmark file. Readers are invited to comment on these alternatives and to suggest additional ideas and options. Tabulation Alternative 1: Using a Bridging Method. The EEO agencies have considered the methods discussed in Appendix D of this report, and have concluded that one of the allocation methods proposed for bridging would be useful during the transition period. The EEO agencies considered the allocation method that assigns an individual who selected more than one race to the largest of the nonwhite groups he/she marked as a viable alternative for EEO purposes. The largest nonwhite group may be ascertained from the racial composition of the population for the relevant geography. This allocation method can be used to assign responses from individuals who reported more than one race to single race categories. With this method, no change would be needed in the statistical methods currently used by the EEO agencies, and for a few years, employers who begin collecting data under the new standards would use this allocation method to report on their EEO forms the racial data for new hires who select more than one race. Employers could also be asked to record on their EEO forms the total number of individuals in their files who selected more than one race. This would provide the EEO agencies with a measure of the changing racial characteristics in work force data and would indicate when the final alternative should be implemented. This method represents an interim solution that would precede full implementation of the new standards. Following careful evaluation of Census 2000 data, decisions could be made that phase in the new standards in an analytically appropriate manner. Tabulation Alternative 2: The Lower and Upper Boundary Approach. Under the new standards, employees will be able to identify themselves as members of more than one racial group. As a result, some individuals who were identified as members of only one group, for example, Black, under the previous standards, may now identify as members of more than one group, for example, Black and White, under the new standards. Thus, when data are reported it will be possible to determine two counts for each racial group. The lower count, or lower 47   boundary, will be those individuals who identify with one race only, for example those who marked only the Black category. The larger count, or upper boundary, adds to the lower boundary those individuals who identify with the given racial category and one or more other racial categories. Thus, the upper boundary Black count includes everyone who marked Black either alone or in combination with one or more other racial categories. The remainder of the population consists of those individuals who did not identify as Black. As a practical matter, in most geographic locations the upper and lower boundaries will not currently be substantially different for purposes of employment data because few adults are expected to report themselves as members of more than one racial group. This assessment is based upon data provided in Appendix D of this report, and documentation of the National Content Survey and the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test conducted by the Census Bureau. Data from some geographic regions are expected to reflect larger numbers and percentages of respondents reporting themselves as belonging to more than one racial group. An interagency group is working on possible modifications to survey forms, such as the EEO-1, that collect aggregated data on the characteristics of many individuals for a single organization, to capture information needed for the upper/lower boundary approach. The tests conducted to date are described in detail in Appendix B of this report. Tabulation Alternative 3: Collect Micro Data from Employers. An alternative approach to using an aggregate reporting form, similar to the EEO-1, is to ask respondents to provide a micro data file containing one record (without identifiers) for each employee. The micro record would include the employee' race or races, ethnicity, gender, and occupational category. This approach s might be simpler for employers, and would provide agencies the maximum amount of flexibility in using the information. Implementation of this approach appears to be a longer-term solution. The EEO agencies would need to work with respondents in designing and implementing the reporting format and method, and they would need to acquire the relevant software and hardware to process the information. Illustrations of Comparisons Under Alternative Tabulation Approaches To illustrate the alternatives, consider the example described earlier in this section. Recall that the ABC Corporation, a large producer of computer software in City X, employs 350 programmers. It is assumed that the ABC Corporation started maintaining self-reported data on race (allowing employees to select one or more races) for their new hires more than a year ago. As a result, their internal files contain a mixture of data collected under the old and new standards. For their 250 programmers hired before the new standards were implemented, information on race in internal files is recorded as one of the four racial groups. These files indicate that 8, or 3.2 percent of the long-term programming staff members, are Black. For the 100 recent employees, race is recorded as one or more of the five groups. According to these records, one of the new programmers has reported that he is Black, one has reported that she is Black and White, and one has reported that he is Black and American Indian. None of the other 97 individuals hired after the new standards 48   were implemented reported Black either alone or in combination with another race. In benchmark have reported have reported and American race or races. data based on Census 2000, the following percentages of programmers in City X that they are Black: 3.3 percent have reported the single race Black, .23 percent that they are Black and White, and .11 percent have reported that they are Black Indian. A total of .42 percent have reported that they are Black and some other  Comparisons Under Alternative 1: Allocation. Because there are more Blacks in City X than any racial group other than White, under the allocation method known as ""largest non-white group"", ABC Corporation would count the 8 long term Black employees and the 3 new employees who selected Black alone or in combination with another race, and report that they have 11 Black programmers (approximately 3.2 percent of their programmers). Similarly the benchmark proportions would count in the Black category everyone who marked Black either alone or with other race(s). This would count a total of 3.72 percent of the available programmers as Black. With these transformations, the counts and percentages are identical to the example provided earlier and the analysis would lead to identical results. If a different racial group were used in the analysis, or a different allocation method were used, results would not necessarily be identical to the earlier example. Comparisons Under Alternative 2: Upper/ Lower Bound. For the upper/ lower bound method, ABC Corporation would report that they have 9 programmers (2.6 percent) in the single race (or lower boundary) Black category, and 2 employees (.6 percent) who have reported Black in combination with another race. Thus, the ""all inclusive"" (or upper boundary) count for Black programmers is 11 (3.2 percent). The benchmark file has 3.3 percent of the programmers in the single race (or lower boundary) Black category, and .42 percent of the programmers who report as Black and at least one other race, yielding a total of 3.72 percent of programmers in the ""all inclusive"" (or upper boundary) category. Given past patterns of discrimination, one would most likely argue that the ""all inclusive"" category would be most appropriate to use. In this example, the resulting counts and percentages are identical to the example provided earlier, and to the results of the allocation method. The analysis could be conducted using the data for the single race category -- or lower bound, as follows. Using the benchmark proportion 3.2 percent, the expected number of Black programmers in a company with 350 programmers in City X is found to be 11 (approximately 3.2 percent of 350). The difference between the number of single race Black programmers in ABC Corporation and the number expected is minus 2 (9 minus 11). In ""standard deviation"" terms the disparity (-2/350) is -.61. This difference is not statistically significant (to be statistically 49   significant, it would need to be less than -1.96). Thus, the number of Black computer programmers employed by the ABC Corporation is not suggestive of an under representation of Black computer programmers in the employer' work force. In this case, the analysis using the s lower bound leads to the same conclusion as the analysis using the upper bound, though the numbers are somewhat different. Note that if a different allocation method was used with tabulation alternative 1, or if one of the other racial groups were used in the example, the upper bound (""all inclusive"" count) would not be identical to the count based on the tabulation allocation method. The reader is referred to Appendix D for a detailed discussion of the impact of the various allocation methods. Comparison Alternative 3: Full Data Reporting. With this method, ABC Corporation will compile a micro data listing of employee characteristics to submit for EEO purposes. The table below illustrates the contents of such a micro data file. This example is intended to illustrate the complete recording of sex, race, and ethnicity. It makes use of the single job category ""programmer,"" and therefore cannot be viewed as a real prototype for EEO reporting. In this table X denotes ""yes,"" zero denotes ""no,"" and blank indicates that the data are not available. The first record (employee number 1) is a Black, non-Hispanic male programmer. His data are recorded in the new format: he was hired after the new reporting system was adopted and had an opportunity to self-select one or more races. He chose to report himself as Black. On the other hand, employee 4 has been an employee for some time, and his data are in the old format. He is also a Black male programmer, but the information provided in this record is what was recorded in the company files prior to conversion to the new reporting system. If this type of information became available from all employers, the EEO agencies could use any of the tests described above, or they would be able to transition to applying the EEO methodology to any groups that become large enough to monitor for EEO, including those that involve more than one race.  50   Illustration of Part of Micro Data File for ABC Corporation ___________________________________________________________________ Employee Sex Hispanic Race Programmer New Format Number WBIAH ___________________________________________________________________ 1 M 0 0 X00 0 X X 2 F X XX00 0 X X 3 M 0 0XX0 0 X X 4 M 0 0X0 0 X 0 5 F 0 0X0 0 X 0 6 F 0 0X0 0 X 0 7 M 0 0X0 0 X 0 8 F 0 0X0 0 X 0 9 M X 0X0 0 X 0 10 M 0 0X0 0 X 0 11 M 0 0X0 0 X 0 12 F X X0 0 0 0 X X 13 . . ... . . . . ___________________________________________________________________ W=White B=Black I=American Indian and Alaska Native A=Asian H=Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Comparisons using Tabulation Alternative 3 would require benchmark data from the Census Bureau for a subset of the 63 different unique combinations of reporting of race.

Vital Records and Intercensal Estimates The revisions to the standards for collecting and presenting Federal data on race and ethnicity pose many challenges to the Census Bureau' Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Because s the population estimates are data driven, changes to the program to provide new racial categories will depend upon the availability of data from a variety of sources. Although changes are possible, it will require discussions with data providers and data users, as well as research and analysis of data collected under the new standards, before the Census Bureau can identify the racial categories that can be used in the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Following some background discussion, this section presents a description of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program, its methodology, and its major uses, and then turns to some of the major issues that must be addressed. Background In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting. Because the intercensal population estimates are limited in their detail by the availability of administrative data, it was not until 1993 that the Intercensal Population Estimates Program could modify its racial categories to follow fully the 1977 standards by providing data for the population in the four major racial categories -- White; Black; Asian or Pacific Islander; and American Indian, Eskimo and Aleut. To comply with the 1977 standards, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program developed estimates by race separately for the population by Hispanic origin (Hispanic, non-Hispanic). The 1997 standards present many challenges with two in particular posing the greatest challenge. One is that respondents to Federal data collections, including Census 2000, surveys, and vital statistics registrations, will be allowed to select one or more races. The other is that the Asian or Pacific Islander aggregate category has been split into two categories -- one called ""Asian"" and the other called ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander."" Because the intercensal population estimates serve several diverse purposes, exploring the possible outcomes of the estimates process and examining the implications of the new standards are important. The intercensal population estimates are used as controls for many Federal surveys, as denominators for important Federal statistics, and as indicators for important program and policy decisions. Because the considerable can produce describe the outputs. issues raised by the 1997 standards are complicated and diverse, it will take research and experimentation before the Intercensal Population Estimates Program population estimates outputs that fully follow the new standards. The next sections program and discuss the major issues that must be addressed in changing program  52   What is the Intercensal Population Estimates Program? The Intercensal Population Estimates Program, under Title 13, develops and releases annual estimates of the total population and its demographic characteristics. For the Nation, states, and counties, these characteristics include annual estimates by: Age -Sex -Race-Hispanic origin -single years of age (age 0 to age 99) and 100+; Male/Female White; Black; Asian and Pacific Islander; and American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut; Hispanic/non-Hispanic  The Intercensal Population Estimates Program currently provides estimates of the total population of functioning governmental units (cities, incorporated places, and minor civil divisions). The Census Bureau is considering expansion of the program to include smaller and more diverse units of geography (such as School Districts), as well as the development of demographic characteristics for functioning governmental units and other smaller geographic units. How Are the Population Estimates Used? The population estimates are used in the intercensal period for funding allocations, as controls for Census Bureau and other Federal surveys, as denominators for vital statistics and other demographic events, and as planning tools for government and private programs. Funding Allocations. Federal programs totaling $180 billion use these annual population estimates to make important program decisions and to distribute these funds. Survey Controls. The population estimates are used as control totals for the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the new American Community Survey (ACS), other Federal surveys, as well as many private surveys. Most Federal surveys use national level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. The ACS currently uses county level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. Denominators for Demographic Events. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) currently uses the national, state, and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators to create birth and death rates and to calculate life tables by race and sex. In addition to the use by NCHS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) frequently relies upon the estimates of population at various geographic levels as denominators for various health related and disease incidence rates. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) uses the county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators for the various cancer incidence rates released to the public. 53   Planning Tools. The intercensal population estimates are frequently used as planning tools and as barometers to measure an area' growth and change since the last decennial census. In making s important policy decisions, local planners frequently cite the overall population level and the demographic characteristics products of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Methodology for Developing Intercensal Population Estimates The Intercensal Population Estimates Program develops its population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin using the demographically recognized cohort-component technique. In this technique, each component of population change -- births, deaths, international migration, and internal migration -- is estimated separately by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Various administrative records provide information needed to develop these components of population change. The estimates process begins with the most recent decennial census results and combines the estimated components of population change to develop the intercensal population estimates. The 1990 Census Base Population. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net undercoverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made in the distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. (See Comparability Issues below for a complete discussion of the modification of the 1990 Decennial Census.) Birth and Death Components. In brief, NCHS provides annual counts and distributions of births and deaths by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin by county to the Census Bureau in a specially developed individual record file of the birth and death events. These individual records contain the detailed race and Hispanic classifications available from the birth and death certificates collected by NCHS. International Migration Component. The international net migration components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. The Census Bureau estimates the distribution by race and Hispanic origin from the country-of-birth tallies, using data from the 1990 Census on the foreign-born population who entered the United States from 1985 to 1990. The other components of international migration such as emigration and undocumented migration are developed using a combination of basic demographic modeling techniques. By examining data from other administrative records in combination with an analysis of the decennial census, the Census Bureau models the level and demographic characteristics of these other international migration components. Internal Migration Component. The data on internal migration are developed using a basic 54   administrative records method. This method relies on annual extracts of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In this approach, using the Social Security Number (SSN) on the return, The Census Bureau can match the tax returns for two years and obtain state of residence for the two periods. By comparing the state of residence at the two points in time, annual measures of migration can be developed for states. Until recently, the Census Bureau had only developed the national population estimates by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population for states and counties. During the current decade, the Census Bureau started to develop a set of state and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. These state population estimates are developed using the basic cohort component technique outlined above. Since the standard tax return provides no demographic characteristics of the tax filer, the Census Bureau must further modify the basic administrative records method to estimate internal migration by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To obtain demographic characteristics, the Bureau has relied on the annual extract of tax returns provided by the IRS, and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration Application File (NUMIDENT). This NUMIDENT file includes SSN, month and year of birth, race, sex, and six characters of the last name for each SSN holder in the sample file. The extract of the NUMIDENT file has been merged with the tax returns file by SSN to derive demographic characteristics of IRS filers. Because the Census Bureau was able to receive only a 20% sample of this basic NUMIDENT file, the Bureau appended the demographic characteristics of the primary filer to only the same 20 percent sample of tax returns. Besides demographic characteristics of the primary filers, the model requires demographic characteristics of those persons claimed as exemptions on the tax return. The rules for assigning demographic characteristics to dependents are straightforward and rely on basic familial and demographic relationships. Because until this year, the NUMIDENT File was restricted to a 20 percent sample, the Census Bureau could not use the merged tax file and SSA data to develop county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To develop the current sets of county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, a ratio approach is employed. This approach combines the full set of age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin detail for the county in 1990 with the newly developed state population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population of the county. With the delivery of the 100 percent NUMIDENT file to the Census Bureau, work on employing the cohort component technique to develop the county estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin is anticipated. Data Availability The intercensal population estimates are ""data driven."" As noted above, the decennial census, the 55   National Center for Health Statistics, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Social Security Administration are all important sources for developing intercensal population estimates. Using the current methodology, estimates cannot be produced without the availability of these data. Decennial Census Data. The Census 2000 will mark the first time that decennial population data are available using the new OMB standards for collecting racial data. The Census Bureau is developing the approaches and timetables for tabulating these data from the Census 2000. Birth and Death Data. The National Vital Statistics System is the basis for the Nation' official s statistics on births and deaths (including infant deaths). The data are provided through vital registration systems maintained and operated by the individual states and territories where the original certificates are filed. While the legal authority for vital registration rests with the states and territories, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is required to produce national vital statistics by collecting data from the vital records of all the states. The NCHS cooperates with the states in developing the standard forms for data collection as well as standard procedures for data preparation and processing in order to promote a uniform national data base. The NCHS shares in the costs incurred by the states through contractual agreements with each state. Under this arrangement, NCHS obtains and publishes vital statistics based on all births and deaths (e.g., 3,891,494 and 2,314,690, respectively, in 1996) occurring in the United States. Implementation of the 1997 standards on vital records will require changes in data collection and processing systems at all levels of government and very likely will take at least several years to accomplish throughout the United States. In addition to revising computer systems at the state and Federal levels, the electronic software that is used in hospitals to record and report over 90 percent of all births in the United States needs to be converted. Most importantly, the procedures used to collect birth and death data in hospitals and funeral homes will need to be revised and the appropriate staff need to be trained. It can be anticipated that not all registration areas will implement the 1997 standards at the same time or with complete coverage and compliance at the start. For example, some states may implement the revised race question on birth and death certificates in the year 2000 in order to be compatible with Census 2000, while others may prefer or need to wait until the next revisions of the U.S. Standard Certificates of Birth and Death are implemented in 2002. During 1998 and 1999, the NCHS is sponsoring a committee of state vital statistics officials and representatives of the relevant professions in a series of meetings to evaluate the entire content and format of the current Standard Certificates. The committee' goal is to submit certificate revisions to the s Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in July 1999 for clearance by the Department. Implementation by the registration areas is expected to occur in January 2002. Some states have indicated a desire to make changes in the race and ethnicity items at the same time as other changes are made. International Migration Components. As discussed above, the international migration 56   components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. To develop data on the race and Hispanic origin of the entering immigrants, the Census Bureau combines the information on country of birth from the INS files with information from the most recent decennial census. Because the INS and other data sources on international migration do not code race or Hispanic origin, no change in these sources is anticipated. The Census Bureau will need to examine the results of Census 2000 and develop new algorithms to accommodate the revised categories for data on race. Internal Migration Components. To develop the internal migration component, the Census Bureau currently relies upon the annual extract of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration Application File (NUMIDENT). Under an agreement between the Census Bureau and the Social Security Administration, the Census Bureau has recently gained access to a full 100 percent NUMIDENT file. This opens additional opportunities for developing subnational population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. This component also presents the biggest obstacle to modifying categories for data on race in the intercensal population estimates process. Under the Social Security system, data on race are provided as part of the Social Security card application process. For the oldest among the population currently covered in the NUMIDENT files, the last application date could refer to the beginning of the Social Security system. Until 1980, the Social Security Administration application system provided three racial categories -- White, Black, and Other. Beginning in 1980, the SSA modified the racial categories on the SSA application form to include five categories -- (1) Asian, Asian-American or Pacific Islander; (2) Hispanic; (3) Black (non-Hispanic); (4) North American Indian or Alaskan Native; (5) White (non-Hispanic). Although SSA modified the racial categories application card, people who already had an SSA card did not have to resubmit their data on race. Thus, pre-1980 entries on the SSA file have information for three racial categories (White, Black, and Other), while entries after 1980 have information for five racial categories. The application for a Social Security card needs to be updated to reflect the 1997 standards. Another change to the Social Security application procedure has presented challenges to the use of data on race. Beginning in the late 1980's, the Social Security Administration introduced the ""enumeration at birth program."" Under this program, parents could request a Social Security Number for their newborn children with the birth registration process. Because the birth certificates do not include racial information for the newborn, it is impossible to code race for the newborn onto the SSA file. While information on race is available for the birth mother and father on the basic birth registration certificate, this data are not made available to the Social Security 57   Administration and is not on the basic NUMIDENT file received by the Census Bureau. Comparability Issues Even the availability of the required source data does not ensure the capability to produce reasonable and accurate population estimates. Production of population estimates by the major demographic characteristics depends upon the availability of comparable data across the various data sources. While comparability issues with respect to race reporting are not new, the increased complexities of the new racial categories are likely to exacerbate the problems. The issues about comparability in race reporting are present in the current set of intercensal population estimates. Data from the 1990 census on race posed several of these problems. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net under coverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made to that distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. For age, the aim was to correct biases in census age tabulations that resulted from displacement of age reporting from the reference date of the census. In 1990 census publications, age is based on respondents' direct reports of age at last birthday, with some editing for age misstatement. This definition proved inadequate for postcensal estimates however, as many respondents reported their age (even if correctly) at the time of completion of the census form or interview by an enumerator, either of which could have occurred several months after the April 1 reference date. As a result, age was slightly biased upward. Modification was based on a respecification of age, for most individual respondents, according to their year of birth. Age was derived from year of birth by allocating date of birth to the first quarter and last three quarters of each year, subtracting year of birth from 1990 for those born before April 1, and from 1989 for those born after April 1. The allocation was based on an historical series of registered births by month. For race, the objective of the modification was to conform to the definition of race specified in the 1977 standards. In the 1990 census, a substantial number of people (roughly 9.8 million) did not specify a racial group that could be classified in any of the categories on the census form: White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander. A large majority of these people were of Hispanic origin (based on their response to a separate, Hispanic origin question on the form), and many wrote in their Hispanic origin, or Hispanic origin type (for example, Mexican or Puerto Rican) as their race. People of unspecified race were allocated to one of the four tabulated racial groups (White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo or Aleut; and Asian or Pacific Islander) based on their response to the Hispanic origin question. These four categories for race conform with the 1977 standards, and are more consistent with the categories in other administrative sources than are the original census tabulations.  58   Census 2000 will pose challenges about reporting of race. The expanded number of categories and the possibility for reporting more than one race translates into over 60 possibilities. The large number of categories that are likely to have few responses will present challenges to the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. When combining across data sets and agencies, the problems of comparability in reporting of become more severe. Clearly, the added complexity of reporting more than one race will add this problem, particularly as different reporting situations (such as the census or the birth and death certificates) engender differential tendencies to report more than one race. Differences allocation and editing procedures will almost certainly exacerbate the problem as exemplified the problem of using data from different data universes in the calculation of rates. Future Direction The process of developing a set of intercensal population estimates consistent with the 1997 standards will not be an easy one. Until data are available, making any commitments about the probable set of products is impossible. The Census Bureau realizes, however, that many data users need to know its plans in order to make their own program decisions. To begin this process, the Census Bureau is forming a technical interagency group of key data providers and key data users to address many of the major issues. Members of this group will provide input on: (1) the feasibility of using one consistent set of categories on race across all geographic levels; (2) the feasibility of using population size as the only criteria for determining which categories by race will have separate population estimates; (3) the minimum cell size below which population estimates will not be produced; (4) the continued development of population estimates by mutually exclusive categories on race; and (5) the use of consistent methodologies for the different categories by race in the population estimates program. This technical group will also examine issues related to data allocation and editing -- important factors related to the data consistency issues. Although detailed data on race from Census 2000 will not be available until mid 2001, during the next few months, the interagency group can address and reach consensus on most of the issues outlined above. Through these discussions with the data providers and data users, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program can begin to form some tentative plans. Although it is too soon to speculate on any outcomes, it is likely that the Intercensal Population Estimates Program will need to be flexible. During the coming decade, as more data become available using the 1997 standards, it is likely that the Census Bureau will continue the expansion of the population estimates program to include additional categories by race. race to in by  59   D. Issues for Further Research (Under Development)  60   V.  COMPARING DATA UNDER THE OLD AND THE NEW STANDARDS  This part of the report provides a summary of the Bridge Report: Tabulation Options for Trend Analysis, which is contained in Appendix D. A. Introduction Agencies whose data are used to display time trends in economic, social, and health characteristics by racial and ethnic groups may need to consider bridging methods to assist users in understanding the data collected under the new standard. For some period of time, referred to as the bridge period, agencies may display historical data along with two estimates for the present time period. The first, a tabulation of the data collected under the new standard (see Part III B), and the second, a ""bridging estimate"" or prediction of how the responses would have been collected and coded under the old standard. Once the bridge period is over, the bridge estimates will no longer be needed. It should not be assumed that bridging is useful or required in every situation. Agencies should carefully consider whether they need bridging estimates. Bridging estimates may not be needed if agencies can tolerate a ""break"" in their data series or if comparison to another data series provides users with enough information about the change. If bridging estimates are not used, however, agencies should footnote the first occurrence of data collected under the new standard. There are at least two purposes of bridge estimates: (1) to help users understand the relationship between the old and new data series (as noted above); and (2) to provide consistent numerators and denominators for the transition period, before all data are available in the new format. If there is a need for bridging, agencies should carefully evaluate alternative methods. The work presented in Appendix D, and summarized below, is intended to help inform agencies about the statistical characteristics of selected bridging methods. Agencies are encouraged to plan and conduct methodological research that will lead to more informed decisions concerning bridging methods and their uses. Such methodological research has long been used to quantify changes in data collection procedures. For example, when methods for coding industry, occupation, or diseases are updated, it is common practice to code data using both sets of coding rules to determine the nature and extent of the changes introduced by the change in procedures. The analyses presented in Appendix D make use of survey data in which the same respondent provided racial information in response to both a question structured under the old standard, and in response to questions similar to those that might be structured under the new standard. These are examples of methodological approaches that can be adopted by agencies, if necessary. In particular, since 1976, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has added a follow-up question for those reporting more than one racial identity, asking them to select the one that they feel best describes them. This information is directly used in some of the most promising bridge 61   techniques. Some agencies may find that adding such a follow-up question to the questions on race and ethnicity, even just once after the implementation of the new standards, would provide valuable survey-specific information for bridging to the past. As agencies conduct such experiments, the results may assist other agencies in understanding the changes associated with transitioning to the new standard. The results discussed here and in Appendix D represent the work of a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from Federal statistical agencies that use and produce data on race and ethnicity. They have spent the past year considering these tabulation issues and conducting research to develop tabulation guidelines for constructing ""bridges"" between racial data collected under the new standards and racial data collected under the old standards. The report sets forth criteria by which different bridging methods should be evaluated and describes the different methods that have been considered thus far. The results of the research conducted on several methods for creating bridges are also presented. This part of the report discusses different options for tabulating racial data in order to create bridges from data collected under the 1997 standards, which have five racial categories and permit the reporting of more than one race, back to the data collected under the previous standards, which identified four racial categories. An ""Other"" category appears in much of the analysis, because it is included in the decennial census and some other surveys. All of these methods (and the research on them reported here) involve the use of individual-level records. Analysis is limited to data collected using the separate questions for race and Hispanic origin. Under the new standards, when reporting is based on self-identification, the two-question format is to be used; even in the case of observer identification, this is the preferred format. It is expected that some users will bridge to a distribution created using the combined format for the question on race and ethnicity. Thus, bridging both to the old racial distribution arising from the use of two questions and one based on a combined, single question are analyzed. At this time, the analysis of bridging to the combined distribution has not been completed, but those results will be included in the report when they become available. Based on the research, the strengths and weaknesses of each tabulation method are discussed. Until all the analysis has been completed, however, recommendations will not be made. B. Methods for Bridging The goal of developing bridging methodology for data on race is to identify a statistical model that will take individuals'responses to the new questions on race and classify those responses as closely as possible to the responses we hypothesize they would have given using the old single race categories. Such a task will be relatively easy or be more difficult depending on how an individual identifies himself or herself under the new standards. For bridging purposes, individuals with only a single racial background are likely to identify as they did before, and no statistical model is needed for bridging. However, those with a mixed racial heritage who were previously required to identify only one part of their background may, under the new standards, choose to 62   report more than one racial identity. When a person identifies with more than one racial group, some model will be necessary to translate those multiple responses into the one, single response we hypothesize that the individual most likely would have reported under the old standards. Framework. Several different methods have been identified for creating a single race distribution from data including multiple race responses. These methods vary in both the assumptions that are made and the procedures that are followed. Before describing the particular methods examined in this report, it is useful to describe some of their major underlying characteristics. One major distinction among the methods is whether an individual' responses are assigned to a s single racial category (termed whole assignment) or to multiple categories (termed fractional assignment). Whole assignment can be based on a set of deterministic rules or based on some probabilistic distribution. For example, a deterministic rule might assign all White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, while a probabilistic rule might randomly assign 60 percent of the White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, and 40 percent into the White category. In the above example, it is unlikely that all individuals identifying as White and American Indian under the new standards would have previously identified as American Indian, so the deterministic rule will result in misclassifications for all those people who had previously identified as White. With a probabilistic rule, an individual' responses s are randomly assigned to either the American Indian category or the White category (such as with 60 percent and 40 percent probabilities, respectively, based on previously collected data). However, even if the overall probabilities matched exactly the aggregate distribution under the old standards, there is no guarantee that the 40 percent who were categorized as White would have classified themselves that way. In fact, in the worst case, all 40 percent who were classified as White would actually have identified as American Indian under the old standards, and a corresponding percentage of those categorized as American Indian would have identified as White. When fractional assignment is used, multiple race responses are categorized into more than one category where each category receives a fraction of a count, and the sum of the fractions equals one. In the above examples of whole assignment, a person' responses were placed into one and s only one category, in an attempt to mimic the past. An alternative is to use a deterministic rule to assign some fraction of the multiple race responses to each of the racial categories identified. For example, a multiple response of White and American Indian might count as ""one-half"" in the tabulations for American Indians and ""one-half"" in the tabulations for Whites. These fractions, like the probabilities in the earlier example, could be varied for different combinations of multiple races to attempt to reflect how often people might identify with one group compared with another. Bridge Tabulation Methods. All of the bridge tabulation methods focus on the assignment of the responses from individuals who identify with more than one racial group. Responses from individuals who identify with only a single racial group under the new standards are assumed to have been the same under the old standards. The response ""Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander"" 63   is assigned to the old racial category of ""Asian or Pacific Islander."" The specific methods for assigning multiple race responses into single race categories are Deterministic Whole Assignment, Deterministic Fractional Assignment, and Probabilistic Whole Assignment. Two sets of results for each of the following tabulation methods are produced. The first set ignores the use of any auxiliary information other than that needed to carry out the particular tabulation method. The other set of results for each method uses the one piece of information that is certain to be common to all data collections done following the new standards, that is, ethnicity. Thus, whether or not an individual is Hispanic is taken into account when a tabulation method is used. (1) Deterministic whole assignment. These methods use fixed, deterministic rules for assigning multiple responses back to one and only one of the racial categories from the old standards. Four alternatives are examined. The first (Smallest Group) assigns responses that include White and another group to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the fewest number of individuals identifying that group as a single race. The second alternative (Largest Group Other Than White) assigns responses that include White with some other racial group, to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the highest single-race count. The third alternative (Largest Group) assigns responses with two or more racial groups into the group with the largest number of individuals as a single race. In this latter case, any combination with White is assigned to the White category, and combinations that do not include White are assigned to the group with the largest single-race count. The fourth alternative (Plurality) assigns responses based on data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS has permitted respondents to select more than one race for a number of years, with only the first two responses captured. However, respondents reporting more than one race were given a follow-up question asking them to select the one race with which they most closely identify (called Main Race here). For these respondents, the proportion choosing each of the two possibilities as their main race was calculated. All responses in a particular multiple-race category using the Plurality method are assigned to the group with the highest proportion of responses on the follow-up question about main race. (2) Deterministic fractional assignment. These methods use fixed, deterministic rules for fractional weighting of multiple-race responses, that is, assigning a fraction to each one of the individual racial categories that are identified. These fractions must sum to 1. Two alternatives are examined. The first (Deterministic Equal Fractions) assigns each of the multiple responses in equal fractions to each racial group identified. Thus, responses with two racial groups are assigned half to each group; those with three groups are assigned one-third to each, etc. The second alternative (Deterministic NHIS Fractions) assigns responses by fractions to each racial group identified, with the fractions drawn from empirical results from the NHIS (as described above). (3) Probabilistic whole assignment. These methods use probabilistic rules for assigning multiple 64   race responses back to one and only one of the previous racial categories. Two alternatives are examined. These parallel the two alternatives discussed under Deterministic Fractional Assignment, except that, for a given set of fractions, the response is assigned to only one racial category. The fractions specify the probabilities used to select a particular category. The first alternative uses equal selection probabilities. The second uses the NHIS fractions where possible, and equal fractions when no information is available from NHIS. Probabilistic Whole Assignment will yield nearly, on average, the same population counts as Deterministic Fractional Assignment. Only the results from Deterministic Fractional Assignment are presented in this report. In practice, there would be a difference between Deterministic Fractional Assignment and Probabilistic Whole Assignment when computing variances for tabulated estimates, and the two methods will yield relatively small differences in distributions for respondent characteristics. In general, Probabilistic Whole Assignment would yield a higher estimated variance than the Deterministic Fractional approach, with the variances for both methods underestimating the true variance. Probabilistic methods which incorporate a ""Multiple Imputation"" statistical technique would result in an unbiased estimate of variance, but at the price of being more difficult to implement (See Rubin 1987.). (4) All Inclusive. A final tabulation method considered is termed the ""All Inclusive"" method. Under this method all responses are used. Responses are assigned to each of the categories that an individual selects. The sum of the categories totals more than 100 percent. C. Methods of Evaluation Data Sources National Health Interview Survey. The NHIS is a continuing nationwide sample survey designed to measure the health status of residents of the United States (Benson and Marano, 1995; Massey et al., 1989). The analysis here uses data from an analytic file that contains three years of NHIS data (1993, 1994, and 1995). For each of these years there were about 45,000 households interviewed, resulting in slightly more than 100,000 individuals per year. The total sample for the bridge analysis is 323,080 (5237 respondents did not provide data on race). Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to choose more than one racial category. As the respondent is handed a card with numbered racial categories, the interviewer asks, ""What is the number of the group or groups that represent your race"". If a respondent selects more than one category, the interviewer then asks, ""Which of those groups would you say best describes your race?"" Although the listed racial groups have changed over time, for 1993 to 1995, the card shown to respondents included 16 separate racial categories (white, black, American Indian, Aleut, Eskimo, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Asian Indian, Samoan, Guamanian, and other Asian and Pacific Islander). Although not on the flashcard, respondents were allowed to give an ""other"" race response. To be consistent, the 16 groups were collapsed to the four 65   previous racial categories: White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN), and Asian or Pacific Islander (API), plus Other. For this analysis, a variable called Detailed Race was created from responses to the first question, which allowed identification with more than one racial group. This information is not included on public use data files of the NHIS. However, on internal files, the first two race groups mentioned are recorded for each observation. Even if a respondent selected more than two groups, only two were recorded on the intermediate file. From the two recorded racial responses, Detailed Race was coded into five single race groups (White, Black, AIAN, API, Other) and 11 multiple race groups (White/Black, White/AIAN, White/API, White/Other, Black/AIAN, Black/API, Black/Other, AIAN/API, AIAN/Other, and API/Other). For most analyses, multiple race combinations that had insufficient numbers were aggregated into the category ""Other Combinations."" Individuals who had two racial groups recorded for Detailed Race but a third group recorded for the ""group that best describes race"" were coded into ""Other Combinations."" The Main Race variable, used as a reference point representing the racial distribution under the old standards, is primarily derived from Detailed Race and the responses to the second question, which asks the respondent for the group that best describes his/her race (Benson and Marano, 1995). For respondents who selected one Detailed Race group, Main Race is the same as Detailed Race. For respondents who selected more than one racial group, Main Race is the one group reported as best describing their race. Some respondents who had chosen more than one race for the Detailed Race question responded as ""Multiple race"" or ""Other"" for the Main Race question. For this analysis, these responses were combined into the ""Other"" category. Categories for Main Race were White, Black, AIAN, API, and Other. May 1995 Supplement on Race and Ethnicity to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The May 1995 CPS Supplement was one in a series of studies conducted for the Federal agencies' review of the standards for data on race and ethnicity. The Supplement was designed to address the following issues: (1) the effect of having a ""multiracial"" race category among the list of races; (2) the effect of adding ""Hispanic"" to the list of racial categories; and (3) the preferences for alternative names for racial and ethnic categories (e.g., African-American for Black, and Latino for Hispanic). The Supplement was organized into four panels representing a two-by-two experimental design for studying the first and second issues outlined above. Each panel was given to one-fourth of the sample, or about 15,000 households (30,000 individuals). All respondents in a household received the same set of questions; household members 15 years and older were asked to respond for themselves, and parents answered for children under 15. Only two of the panels in the CPS Supplement permitted respondents to report in a multiracial category (panels 2 and 4), and only one panel had separate race and Hispanic origin questions (panel 2) as ultimately recommended in the new standards. Therefore, panel 2 data were used to analyze the effects of the different tabulation methods for the two-question format. The smaller sample (about 30,000 observations) hampers analysis and generalizations when the focus is on the small portion of the sample (about 1 percent) who identified as ""multiracial."" 66   There are additional limitations to these data for evaluating the bridging methods. The option respondents were given to identify multiple races in the CPS Supplement was a multiracial category with a follow-up question asking respondents to indicate all the racial groups with which they identified. The new standards allow people to identify directly with all the racial groups they choose and do not include a ""multiracial"" category. Furthermore, a large percentage of individuals who chose the multiracial category in panel 2 of the Supplement did not specify more than one racial group (see Tucker et al., 1996). For purposes of this evaluation, individuals were classified as belonging to the specific racial categories they identified. Those who identified as being multiracial but then did not give two or more specific racial groups were reclassified in the one racial category they gave. Thus, the distribution of the CPS Supplement data reported here differs from that which was published in earlier reports, which classified as multiracial any person who identified with the multiracial category even if they only specified one racial group. This new distribution is referred to here as the ""Edited Distribution."" This edited distribution was used with the various tabulation methods. As in NHIS, the resulting distributions were compared to a reference distribution based on the respondents'original answers (in the first CPS interview) to the race question that followed the old standards. 1998 Washington State Population Survey. The 1998 Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) was designed to provide information on Washington residents between decennial censuses. The survey collected data on employment, income, education, and health, along with basic demographic information. The WSPS was done by telephone and included 7,279 households with telephones. Blacks, Asians, Hispanics and American Indians were over sampled. The designated respondent was the individual with the greatest knowledge about the household. The respondent weights reflect this over sampling and, thus, results are representative of the Washington population as a whole. The response rate for the entire sample was between 50 and 60 percent. Information about the race of the respondent was collected twice during the course of the interview. At the beginning of the survey, the respondent was asked, ""Are you of Hispanic origin?"" Following that question, the respondent was asked, ""What is your race?"" The categories were the ones appearing under the old standards, but the order was as follows: Black; American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; Asian or Pacific Islander; and White. An ""Other"" category also was allowed, and the interviewer recorded the verbatim response on a ""specify"" line. Near the end of the survey, the respondent was asked race questions conforming to the new standards. Besides the same Hispanic origin question, the respondent was asked to specify country of origin. For race, the respondent was asked to select one or more categories. This time the ordering of the categories was White; Black or African American (or Haitian or Negro); American Indian or Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Asian. Again, an ""Other"" category was provided. There also was a follow-up question for Asian respondents to specify country of origin. The results from the race question at the end of the survey were used with the tabulation methods. The reference distribution came from the answers to the original race question. 67   Advantages and Disadvantages of These Data Sources Only the Washington State data closely resemble the way the question on race will be asked under the new standards. Yet, all three can offer insights into the relationship between how individuals will actually respond to the new question on race and how they responded to the question under the old standards. The NHIS and the CPS Supplement are nationally representative, and the Washington State data serve as an example for evaluating the tabulation methods at the state level. Simulations using 1990 census data also were conducted, but the results differed little from those for the other data sets. At this point, it is believed that an analysis of data from the 1998 Dress Rehearsal for Census 2000 would be of greater utility. Furthermore, the Dress Rehearsal data will provide examples of the effects of the new standards at the local level. Thus, this analysis will be included in the next version of this report. Description of New Analyses The analyses concentrated on the bridge tabulation methods. These analyses can be divided into three broad areas: (1) descriptions of racial distributions under the alternative bridging tabulation methods; (2) rates of racial ""misclassification"" for these alternatives; and, (3) sensitivity of outcome measures to the bridging alternatives. Distribution of Race. For the first phase of the analysis (using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the data from Washington State), the distributions of race under the allocation alternatives described previously were calculated: All Inclusive, Deterministic Whole Allocation (Smallest Group, Largest Group Other Than White, Largest Group, and Plurality) and Fractional Allocation (Equal Fractions and NHIS Fractions). These new distributions were compared to the reference distribution in each data set. At this time, it is unknown what percentage of people in the United States will identify with more than one racial group when given the opportunity to do so in Census 2000 and in subsequent surveys. For purposes of illustrating the effects of a greater proportion of individuals identifying more than one racial background, analyses were conducted increasing the proportion of multiple race responses two-, four-, six- and eight-fold using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State micro data sources. The racial distributions were compared using each of the tabulation methods to see effects with increasing levels of reporting more than one race. Of necessity, these tabulations assume that the increases are the same across the different combinations of more than one race. The accuracy of this assumption cannot be tested. The purpose of these analyses is not to attempt to make accurate predictions about the extent of multiple race reporting or its composition, but rather to see more clearly possible differences among tabulation methods that may only become apparent with a greater percentage of more than one race reporting. Misclassification of Race. Besides evaluating the overall racial distributions produced by the tabulation methods, the misclassification of individuals also needs to be examined. For the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State survey, these misclassification rates were formed by comparing an individual' answer to the race question under the old standards to the assigned s 68   category of the individual' response(s) to the race question under the new standards using each s of the tabulation methods. The misclassification rate and its standard error for each race by tabulation method were produced. Preliminary Outcomes Assessment. In the last phase of the analysis, the impact of multiple-race reporting on outcome measures was assessed. This process is important because users in many of the Federal agencies are not typically examining race distributions, but rather trends and indicators for the Nation (e.g., health outcomes, economic well-being, educational attainment) across racial groups. This is where the majority of work will need to be done within individual agencies as the new standards are implemented. An initial examination of how common statistics could be affected by reporting of more than one race was conducted. Five outcome measures were examined, three from the NHIS and two from the CPS Supplement. From the NHIS, three routine health outcomes were calculated: percent of respondents in poor or fair health, percent of children living with a single mother, and percent of respondents with no health insurance. From the CPS Supplement, the proportions of respondents who were unemployed and the labor force participation rates for different racial groups were calculated. These estimates based on the bridging alternatives are not meant to be precise measures of these factors, but are used to demonstrate the possible impact reporting of multiple races and the tabulation methods may have on these and similar estimates. D. Examination of the Results with Respect to the Evaluation Criteria Bridging to the past will be needed for measuring change in a variety of circumstances. Besides measuring population growth, any number of economic, social, and health outcomes must be monitored. This work will involve different population groups at different levels of geography. As a first step toward providing the information users will need to make informed decisions about the methods, the strengths and weaknesses of the bridging methods with respect to the evaluation criteria outlined at the beginning of this report are discussed, based on the results of the statistical analyses conducted. The details of these statistical analyses can be found in Appendix D. Measure Change Over Time. As indicated earlier, measuring change over time is the criterion that is of greatest importance in evaluating the bridging methods. The first and second phases of the analysis shed light on the performance of the various methods in this area. In essence, an ideal bridging method in this case is one that not only accurately recreates the population distribution under the old standards such that the only difference remaining is a function of true change over time, but also assigns an individual' response to the old category that would have been chosen. s The methodology used in these studies allows users, within limits, to see how well the bridging methods using racial data collected under the new standards can match data from the same respondents collected (at about the same time) under the old standards. To the extent that there is a match, any change that would occur from this point forward would indicate true change. If the match is poor, it is not possible to isolate the true change. When comparing the different methods to their reference distributions, the racial categories that 69   were most sensitive to which method is chosen were the numerically small ones, particularly the AIAN category. While different data sets were used in each study and the racial questions were not the same, the studies indicate that the Largest Group Deterministic Whole Assignment method, the Plurality method, and the two Deterministic Fractional Assignment methods produce distributions closer to the reference distributions than do the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method. Controlling for ethnicity had no effect on these results. One reason the Largest Group Assignment method results are so close is that it has little effect on the smaller races, because most assignments are made to Black or White, and the percentages for these two races are so large that the relatively small increase they receive is not noticeable. The Plurality method produces a good fit, because it makes assignments at the level of specific racial combinations. The performance of the NHIS Fractional Assignment method can be discounted to a degree in the NHIS study because the analysis is somewhat circular; however, the results from the CPS Supplement and the Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) show this method yields a relatively close match. The Equal Fractional Assignment method produces a reasonable match in these studies. The primary reason that the other two Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method do not perform as well is that they alter the White percentage to some extent and substantially increase the percentage in the AIAN category. In the case of misclassification rates, some contradictory results emerge. While the AIAN and ""Other"" categories have high misclassification rates across all tabulation methods in the CPS Supplement, the same is not true for the other two surveys. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment methods produce the most comparable results for the AIAN category in both surveys and for the ""Other"" category in the WSPS; however, these methods have higher overall misclassification rates. Both the CPS Supplement and the WSPS have large misclassification rates for these two categories when using many of the tabulation methods. When the distributions of the outcome variables are examined, all methods produce comparable, and relatively close matches for all health outcomes. For the AIAN unemployment rate, the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method appear to produce the least comparable results, but none of the differences are significant. There are significant differences in the AIAN labor force participation rates for several of the tabulation methods. It is likely that which method is best at matching a reference distribution for outcome measures will depend on the outcome being examined. Unfortunately, the data to assess the best tabulation method for each outcome may never be readily available. All of these conclusions should be viewed with caution. Many assumptions had to be made in these studies. It is unclear how people will respond to the new racial question in the future, and these responses could differ by mode of data collection and with the subject of the survey. Furthermore, most of this work on developing bridging methods relied on sample data, and small samples at that. Congruence with Respondent' Choice. This criterion concerns how well the full range of the s 70   respondent' choices is represented in the racial distribution. It is more important for evaluating s ongoing tabulations under the new standards, but the bridging methods can be differentiated with respect to this criterion, too. None of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods take into account the full range of the respondent' selections, but the Plurality method at least controls for s the particular racial combination chosen by the respondent under the new standards. The All Inclusive method accurately reflects all selections by tabulating actual responses and not people. The Equal Fraction Assignment method tabulates people, but, like the All Inclusive method, treats all responses equally. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method takes all responses into account, but assignment is based on attempting to estimate in which single-race category the respondent would prefer to be counted. Range of Applicability. This criterion refers to how well the bridging method can be applied in different contexts. The All Inclusive method provides the same results in every context, because assignment does not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution. This method is not suitable for users who need a distribution that adds to 100 percent. Of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods, the Largest Group Assignment method is the least sensitive to context and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are as easy to use as the Largest Group Whole Assignment method, but the results for the small racial categories will vary to a greater extent with the context, particularly according to level of geography. The Equal Fraction Assignment method is as generalizable as the All Inclusive method, but it is not quite as easy to use. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method may be the most problematic, because they currently only represent a national preference distribution based on data from 1993 to 1995. The use of this distribution at the local level would be likely to produce inaccurate results in a number of cases. That is not to say that the other methods do not face the same problem. Meet Confidentiality and Reliability Standards. Because these methods all attempt to reproduce the racial categories under the old standards, the same confidentiality problems that existed over the last 20 years will continue to exist. No increase in problems is anticipated. In the case of reliability, however, the situation is different. The All Inclusive method will not produce less reliable data than data produced under the old standards. The Equal Fraction Assignment method may have reliability problems as a result of only adding fractional counts to some of the smaller categories if these categories have a high probability of being chosen as the preferred single race. The same would be true if equal fractions were used to make whole assignments. In sample surveys, the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods will have reliability problems to the extent that there is a large variance on the individual race proportions. This is likely to occur when small samples are involved. The Largest Group Whole assignment method should have the fewest problems with respect to reliability, and the Smallest Group Whole Assignment method will likely have the most. These methods have another problem, however, in that an individual' s response may be assigned to different categories at different levels of geography. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method, as well as methods where fractions are used for whole assignment (i.e., the Plurality method), is based upon a sample distribution with its own variance properties. Reliability for the very small combinations will be quite bad unless many years of data are 71   combined, and this presents its own problems. Minimize Disruptions to the Single Race Distributions. This criterion is only relevant for evaluation of bridging methods. Its purpose is to see how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the new standards. To the extent that a bridging method can meet the other bridging criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportions in the ongoing distribution, it will have value for looking both forward and backward in time. An evaluation of the different methods according to this criterion involves the comparison of the bridge distributions to the detailed race distribution under the new standards in each case. For the CPS Supplement, the Plurality method is marginally closer than the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the Fractional methods. While the All Inclusive method and the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods match for the White category, they differ substantially from the single-race AIAN category in the detailed distribution and are marginally worse for the API category. The NHIS Fractional method is the closest in both the NHIS and WSPS. Statistically Defensible. To be statistically defensible, the bridging method must conform to acceptable statistical conventions. The All Inclusive method makes no assumption about how respondents would assign themselves in the single race situation. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method are based on an observed distribution, and, to that extent, involve less judgment than the rest of the methods that assign people and not responses. While the Equal Fractional Assignment method is based on judgment, it does not make assumptions about the relative importance of any given race. The Largest Group Whole Assignment method does assign greater importance to one of the races, but it also follows common, but different, statistical practice than the equal fraction approach. Both attempt to minimize the error in assignment. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment method and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment method do not follow statistical practice, but, instead, rely on the historical record of discrimination; even in these cases, however, the assigned category is based on an observed distribution. Ease of Use. ""Ease of use"" refers to how complicated it is to produce the bridge results. The Equal Fractional Assignment method makes assignments that do not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution at hand. It and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method do require the duplication of individual records or the creation, on every record, of a variable for each racial category under the old standards in order to be able to assign fractions for any combination of categories. If the fractional methods are used to assign a respondent to a single category (whole probabilistic methods), this cumbersome process can be avoided. The All Inclusive method, like the Equal Fractional method, does not depend on the particular distribution, but it does produce proportions that add to more than 100 percent unless they are raked or repercentaged to a base of 100 percent each time. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the NHIS Fractional method would require an extra step unless only national figures are used, because the relative size of the groups must be determined for each detailed distribution. Otherwise, they are as easy to 72   use as the whole probabilistic methods. Skill Required. This criterion refers to the skills required to carry out the bridge operations. The amount of computer expertise to perform the operations associated with each of these methods is fairly trivial. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods require almost no statistical knowledge. Some familiarity with the statistical adjustment literature would be useful for understanding the Deterministic Fractional Assignment procedures. If the All Inclusive method were used, users might need to understand statistical raking. Understandability and Communicability. This criterion concerns how easily the methods can be explained and understood by the average user. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are both easy to explain and easy to understand. The fractional assignment of individuals to a single category also is not difficult to follow. Assigning fractions of a person to different categories may be easy to explain, but the average user may find it difficult to accept the idea. The All Inclusive method also is easily explained, but, unless the percentages are raked to 100 percent, users may have a problem understanding how to use the results.

The categories in this classification are social-political constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. They are not to be used as determinants of eligibility for participation in any Federal program. The standards have been developed to provide a common language for uniformity and comparability in the collection and use of data on race and ethnicity by Federal agencies. The standards have five categories for data on race: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. There are two categories for data on ethnicity: ""Hispanic or Latino,"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino."" 1. Categories and Definitions The minimum categories for data on race and ethnicity for Federal statistics, program administrative reporting, and civil rights compliance reporting are defined as follows: -American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used in addition to ""Black or African American."" Hispanic or Latino. A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, ""Spanish origin,"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic or Latino."" Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, 74  --  --  --  ---   or North Africa. Respondents shall be offered the option of selecting one or more racial designations. Recommended forms for the instruction accompanying the multiple response question are ""Mark one or more"" and ""Select one or more."" 2. Data Formats The standards provide two formats that may be used for data on race and ethnicity. Selfreporting or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. In situations where self-reporting is not practicable or feasible, the combined format may be used. In no case shall the provisions of the standards be construed to limit the collection of data to the categories described above. The collection of greater detail is encouraged; however, any collection that uses more detail shall be organized in such a way that the additional categories can be aggregated into these minimum categories for data on race and ethnicity. With respect to tabulation, the procedures used by Federal agencies shall result in the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as possible. However, Federal agencies shall not present data on detailed categories if doing so would compromise data quality or confidentiality standards. a. Two-question format To provide flexibility and ensure data quality, separate questions shall be used wherever feasible for reporting race and ethnicity. When race and ethnicity are collected separately, ethnicity shall be collected first. If race and ethnicity are collected separately, the minimum designations are: Race: -----Ethnicity: -- Hispanic or Latino -- Not Hispanic or Latino American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White  75   When data on race and ethnicity are collected separately, provision shall be made to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic or Latino. When aggregate data are presented, data producers shall provide the number of respondents who marked (or selected) only one category, separately for each of the five racial categories. In addition to these numbers, data producers are strongly encouraged to provide the detailed distributions, including all possible combinations, of multiple responses to the race question. If data on multiple responses are collapsed, at a minimum the total number of respondents reporting ""more than one race"" shall be made available. b. Combined format The combined format may be used, if necessary, for observer-collected data on race and ethnicity. Both race (including multiple responses) and ethnicity shall be collected when appropriate and feasible, although the selection of one category in the combined format is acceptable. If a combined format is used, there are six minimum categories: ------American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Hispanic or Latino Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White  When aggregate data are presented, data producers shall provide the number of respondents who marked (or selected) only one category, separately for each of the six categories. In addition to these numbers, data producers are strongly encouraged to provide the detailed distributions, including all possible combinations, of multiple responses. In cases where data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting ""Hispanic or Latino and one or more races"" and the total number of respondents reporting ""more than one race"" (regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided. 3. Use of the Standards for Record Keeping and Reporting The minimum standard categories shall be used for reporting as follows: a. Statistical reporting These standards shall be used at a minimum for all federally sponsored statistical data collections that include data on race and/or ethnicity, except when the collection involves a sample of such size that the data on the smaller categories would be unreliable, or when the collection effort focuses on a specific racial or ethnic group. Any other variation will have to be specifically authorized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the information 76   collection clearance process. In those cases where the data collection is not subject to the information collection clearance process, a direct request for a variance shall be made to OMB. b. General program administrative and grant reporting These standards shall be used for all Federal administrative reporting or record keeping requirements that include data on race and ethnicity. Agencies that cannot follow these standards must request a variance from OMB. Variances will be considered if the agency can demonstrate that it is not reasonable for the primary reporter to determine racial or ethnic background in terms of the specified categories, that determination of racial or ethnic background is not critical to the administration of the program in question, or that the specific program is directed to only one or a limited number of racial or ethnic groups. c. Civil rights and other compliance reporting These standards shall be used by all Federal agencies in either the separate or combined format for civil rights and other compliance reporting from the public and private sectors and all levels of government. Any variation requiring less detailed data or data which cannot be aggregated into the basic categories must be specifically approved by OMB for executive agencies. More detailed reporting which can be aggregated to the basic categories may be used at the agencies' discretion. 4. Presentation of Data on Race and Ethnicity Displays of statistical, administrative, and compliance data on race and ethnicity shall use the categories listed above. The term ""nonwhite"" is not acceptable for use in the presentation of Federal Government data. It shall not be used in any publication or in the text of any report. In cases where the standard categories are considered inappropriate for presentation of data on particular programs or for particular regional areas, the sponsoring agency may use: a. The designations ""Black or African American and Other Races"" or ""All Other Races"" as collective descriptions of minority races when the most summary distinction between the majority and minority races is appropriate; The designations ""White,"" ""Black or African American,"" and ""All Other Races"" when the distinction among the majority race, the principal minority race, and other races is appropriate; or The designation of a particular minority race or races, and the inclusion of ""Whites"" with ""All Other Races"" when such a collective description is appropriate. In displaying detailed information that represents a combination of race and ethnicity, the 77  b.  c.   description of the data being displayed shall clearly indicate that both bases of classification are being used. When the primary focus of a report is on two or more specific identifiable groups in the population, one or more of which is racial or ethnic, it is acceptable to display data for each of the particular groups separately and to describe data relating to the remainder of the population by an appropriate collective description. 5. Effective Date The provisions of these standards are effective immediately for all new and revised record keeping or reporting requirements that include racial and/or ethnic information. All existing record keeping or reporting requirements shall be made consistent with these standards at the time they are submitted for extension, or not later than January 1, 2003.  78   Appendix B Procedural Implementation of the New Standards for Data on Race and Ethnicity -- Phase I Report An interagency committee was established to develop guidelines that will assist Federal agencies in their implementation of the Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity issued on October 30, 1997. The procedural implementation guidelines address three areas: (1) wording and format of questions that ask for self-reported race and Hispanic or Latino origin; (2) wording and format of instructions and forms that collect aggregate race and Hispanic or Latino origin data; and (3) instructions and training procedures for field interviewers and administrative personnel who will be using these questions and forms. Members of the committee represent the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, and the General Accounting Office. An OMB Clearance Package was approved in March 1998 which authorized the pretesting of different questions and forms. This report describes the study objectives of the three areas, the research design, and the progress to date for Phase I. A second phase will focus on additional issues not resolved in Phase I. Development and Testing of Self-Reported Race and Hispanic or Latino Origin Questions A goal of this research is to provide guidance on the wording and format of self-reported race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions used in a variety of data collection efforts. Following are three of the most significant changes to the ways in which race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions are to be asked by Federal agencies. C Self-report or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. When race and ethnicity are collected separately, ethnicity shall be collected first.  79   C C  Respondents shall be offered the option of selecting one or more racial designations. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander is to be treated as a distinct category from Asian.  The committee' primary objective is to develop and test a series of questions that agencies can s use to guide the design of future data collection instruments. To design the test questions, the committee reviewed current survey practice, prior research on measuring race and ethnicity, and the survey literature on questionnaire design. This led to the identification of three factors which influenced the general design, format, and wording of race and ethnicity test questions. First, questions needed to be as similar as possible to those that were subjected to extensive testing prior to the issuance of the revised standards. In particular, questions used in previous research from the Current Population Survey, the National Content Survey, and the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test (see Federal Register Notice July 1997 for discussion of the results of those tests) were considered. Second, questions needed to be tested in both face-to-face interviews as well as telephone interviews.2 And third, both short and long versions of questions needed to be developed--short in that the question should seek to collect the minimum information specified in the revised standards and long in that the question should collect subgroup information. The minimum level of detail for race questions is the five revised categories--American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Long versions of the race question provide for reporting of subgroups such as Chinese, Japanese, Samoan, and so forth. For Hispanic or Latino origin questions, the minimum level of detail is a Yes or No response indicating Hispanic or Latino origin background. Long versions of the question provide for reporting of subgroups such as Puerto Rican, Cuban, and so forth. At this time, there are no plans to assess comparability of responses across modes; that is, the final report will offer guidelines on ways to ask a question when using a particular mode rather than 2  Mode can also include whether the question administration is done using a computer; at this time, there is no plan for testing computer-administered instruments.  80   provide an analysis of the effects of response distributions when using a particular mode. It will be incumbent upon individual agencies to make final determinations on the exact wording and format of questions and the potential measurement error that may be associated with a given design should be assessed. 1.1 Research Design  Qualitative research using cognitive pretesting methods are being used to test race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. The research plan includes two phases. Phase I is still in progress; most of it has been completed and took place during 1998 in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Eventually, Phase I will include approximately 50 laboratory interviews conducted face-toface or by telephone. Phase II will be similar in scope to Phase I, will begin in 1999, and will be conducted in selected geographic sites outside of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Phase I does not include tests of self-administered race and ethnicity questions since the Census Bureau has already conducted considerable research in preparation for Census 2000. The Census Bureau conducted cognitive research as well as large scale field interviews as part of the Census Bureau' National Content Survey, Race and Ethnicity Targeted Test, and Census 2000 Dress s Rehearsal test. Therefore, the self-administered format options contained in Section 1.3.2 of this report are based mostly on the research accomplished by the Census Bureau. Phase I cognitive testing is conducted as part of a 10-20 minute survey which asks general household information (such as who lives in the household, the age, gender, education level, marital status, and income level of household members) followed by Hispanic or Latino origin and race questions. After the survey is completed, the subject is debriefed by a cognitive interviewer to discuss the meaning of the words and phrases in the race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. Attachment A contains the instrument used for testing. It is important to remember that only a few questions have been selected for testing; other variations of ethnicity and race questions could certainly have been tested and may, in fact, work 81   just as well or better in a particular survey. For example, all of the Hispanic or Latino origin test questions include the word Spanish in the question; that is, the test question asks Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino? rather than Are you Hispanic or Latino? It is relevant, then, to note that the options on the following pages reflect what worked well among the different questions tested, not what is the best way to ask a race or Hispanic or Latino origin question. Phase I test results and the examples presented should not imply limitations or constraints to other question designs that comply with the revised standards. The research design for Phase I has been modified over the past six months and currently has six experimental conditions. Two conditions test the questions by telephone and four conditions test the questions face-to-face. Optimally, each test condition will include at least 8 subjects, 1 whose parents are both American Indian or Alaska Native, 1 whose parents are both Asian, 1 whose parents are both Black or African American, 1 whose parents are both Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 1 whose parents are both White, 1 whose parents are both Hispanic or Latino (regardless of race), and 2 whose parents are different races (regardless of the particular race combinations).3 Participants are recruited mostly by newspaper advertisements and flyers. Some additional recruitment efforts may be directed at community centers or other organizations in order to reach individuals who are Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, and individuals who are more than one race. Subjects are paid $25 for one hour, and interviews are audio-taped or video-taped, depending on the interview site. Attachment C shows the progress to date by test condition. 1.2 Results  Thirty-two cognitive interviews (25 face-to-face and 7 telephone) have been completed.  Participants are not asked to report their race or ethnicity during the telephone screening interview. Rather, they are asked to report the race and ethnicity of their mother and their father, along with a few other demographic questions about each of their parents. The reported race of their parents are used to assign subjects to a particular test condition. Also, it is compared with the race(s) individuals report themselves to be in order to provide further information on the process of self-identification of race and Hispanic or Latino origin.  3  82   Generally, subjects were able to provide answers to both long and short versions of race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. As expected, subjects who were interviewed face-to-face seemed to use and rely on the flashcards to select a response. Subjects interviewed by telephone had a bit more difficulty answering the race questions since they had to listen to a relatively long list of response options. 1.2.1 Testing Hispanic or Latino Origin Questions Two subjects answered ""Yes"" to the Hispanic or Latino origin question and 30 answered ""No."" During debriefings, all subjects were asked their impressions of the other Hispanic or Latino test questions and were shown various versions of the Hispanic or Latino flashcard. Subjects were generally familiar with Hispanic or Latino origin questions, regardless of the particular test condition. As found in previous research, subjects define Hispanic and Latino differently but they are comfortable with both terms used in the same question. Since the test questions also included the term Spanish (which is allowed by the revised standards), subjects were asked their opinion about including the word Spanish; most stated they thought that the word Spanish was important to include. Subjects commonly defined Hispanic as indicating geographic location or Spanish origin, Spanish as indicating European origin or coming from the country of Spain, and Latino as a cultural concept associated with Latin American cooking, dress, and language. Face-to-face interviews: All of the 25 subjects interviewed face-to-face seemed to find the Hispanic or Latino origin flashcards useful. Two flashcard versions were tested; Flashcard 7A and Flashcard 7B each list the detailed Hispanic or Latino origin subgroups but in different ways. When shown both flashcards, subjects preferred Flashcard 7A which lists the subgroups under the main category ""Yes, Spanish, Hispanic, Latino.""  83   Flashcard 7A No Yes Not Spanish, Hispanic, Latino Spanish, Hispanic, Latino Includes Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or other Spanish, Hispanic, Latino  Flashcard 7B No Yes Not Spanish, Hispanic, Latino Spanish, Hispanic, Latino Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano Puerto Rican Cuban Other Spanish, Hispanic, Latino  Telephone interviews: For the 7 subjects interviewed by telephone, 4 were asked a short Hispanic or Latino question and 3 were asked a long version, both shown below.  Short  Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino?  Long  Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino? If Yes and no further information is provided, ask Which one of the following are you? Are you Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or of another Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino group? 84   Regardless of version, all of the telephone subjects were able to answer the first part of the question without difficulty. The second part of the long version has not been tested with enough Hispanic or Latino subjects, since one needs to answer ""Yes"" to the first part in order to test the second part. However, interviewers expressed concern that the long version may present some response problems since respondents will have to recall six possible categories without use of a flashcard or other visual aid. 1.2.2 Testing Race Questions Among the 32 subjects interviewed, 13 reported their race as Black, 3 reported Asian, 2 reported Native Hawaiian, 4 reported more than one race, and 10 reported White, of which 2 also reported Hispanic or Latino origin. No American Indians or Alaska Natives were interviewed in Phase I. Two of the 4 subjects who reported more than one race for themselves reported their parents as both being the same race. These two subjects based their multiple race reports on the backgrounds of grandparents or great-grandparents which is consistent with prior research. Of the four subjects who reported more than one race, three reported combinations of Native Hawaiian, White, and either Japanese and/or Chinese.4 The fourth subject to report more than one race replied White and Asian. Face-to-face interviews: Subjects who were interviewed face-to-face heard the question read and were handed a flashcard containing the response options. Several subjects indicated initial surprise at not seeing a Hispanic or Latino category or its equivalent. For example, one subject said ""Given the choices here, I don' see what I should put down. I guess I have to say White, t but that' not right."" When asked the meaning of certain race terms, some subjects referred to s geographic origin, some mentioned facial or skin color characteristics, and others mentioned a particular culture or heritage. Several subjects were specially recruited through a Native Hawaiian source which accounts for the frequency of Native Hawaiian responses. 85 4   Among the three flashcards tested, subjects preferred Flashcard 9 or Flashcard 10 (see below). In one case, a Filipino subject responded differently depending on the flashcard used. She was first shown a long version (Flashcard 10) and responded ""Filipino, I guess under Asian."" In the debriefing, she was then shown a short version (Flashcard 9) and again was asked her race. She responded ""Other Pacific Islander because the Philippines are a Pacific Island. So I guess my answer would be different depending on the list used."" Flashcard 9 White Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander  Flashcard 10 White Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Asian Indian Japanese Chinese Korean Filipino Vietnamese Other Asian Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Native Hawaiian Guamanian or Chamorro Samoan Other Pacific Islander  Telephone interviews: Subjects interviewed by telephone were only asked a short version of the race question as shown below.  86   Short  I' going to read a list of racial categories. Please select one or m more to best describe your race. Are you White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander?  There was some indication that hearing a list with alternative terms representing one category (i.e., Black or African American is one category, not two) may result in confusion. Specifically, two subjects thought the interviewer asked them to choose between Black or African American and commented that they did not like having to make a choice. This problem can be addressed through interviewer training that teaches the interviewer to pause longer after saying each category term or phrase; that is, if the interviewer is reading a list of ""...White, Black or African American, Asian, ..."" she/he should pause between the words White and Black, not pause between Black or African American, and pause again between African American and Asian. This should help the telephone respondent hear that Black or African American is one choice, not two. There was some evidence that the instruction to ""...select one or more..."" was misunderstood on the telephone to mean that the subject had to select more than one race. Interviewers will need to be trained to perceive and correct for this. 1.2.3 Concepts of Race and Ethnicity As has been noted elsewhere in the literature, respondents often do not make clear distinctions between the terms used in describing race, ethnicity, nationality, and ancestry. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared but individual differences in the interpretation and meaning of terms used was found, as was confusion regarding the separation of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. The following examples from the cognitive interviews illustrate these findings. C It means ethnic background. Not the country. I think people tend to cross quickly between using the terms race and country. When I say ""Yes, I am Hawaiian"" I mean that in my bloodstream I have Hawaii. My blood inheritance.  87   C C C C  Race I guess means the color somebody is. Or, their cultural heritage. The word race means the biological heritage from which you descend. Race means the culture that someone is from. The way I think of race, I think of it as a negative, probably because of what we' ve read about in the 60's--race riots, etc. It always seems to have a negative connotation. I prefer to use ethnicity. I answer differently sometimes, depending on what' beneficial to my family or me. s Sometimes you see Hispanic as a choice for race. If Hispanic had been offered as a race then I would have chosen that. The race question is difficult because it doesn' have enough categories, it' too t s restrictive. With only five categories, there are two that are too specific-American Indian and Native Hawaiian--and there' a list of countries for the s Asians. It doesn' specify anything about Central or South American descent. t Everybody comes from different backgrounds; even White Americans can probably check off Irish, etc. Guidelines for the Design of Race and Ethnicity Questions  C C C  1.3  As has been discussed earlier in this chapter, the Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity issued on October 30, 1997 set forth principles that should be followed when collecting race and ethnicity data for Federal reporting purposes. These principles and the guidelines below should serve to assist in the design and format of race and ethnicity questions contained in Federal data collection instruments. In addition, there is a rich literature on questionnaire design and data collection methods as well as the measurement of race and ethnicity. Readers are strongly encouraged to consult the literature and are referred to a suggested reference list contained at the end of this chapter. By no means comprehensive, this list should provide at least a starting point for those seeking further guidance. Following the guidelines below are examples of questions to illustrate specific formats and wording depending on the mode of data collection.  88   Guideline 1: Communicate clearly an instruction that allows multiple responses to the race question. The revised standards are clear that the format and wording used in a race question must communicate to the respondent an instruction that multiple responses are acceptable. Based on research findings, the recommended forms for this instruction are Mark one or more or Select one or more. The committee supports these recommendations but recognizes that other possible instructions may be preferred, especially when integrating a race question within an existing data collection instrument. For example, some mail instruments do not word questions in a personal way; that is, rather than What is your age? an instrument may simply have Age with a line for an entry. Taking this case further, if one has an item simply worded as Race with a line for an entry, then an instruction must be included to communicate that multiple race responses are acceptable. Variations could include Race - enter one or more. Regardless of exact wording, the instruction must be evident to the respondent. Guideline 2: Consider using an instruction to answer both the Hispanic or Latino question and the race question. This has particular relevance for mail surveys or questionnaires that are selfadministered since there is no interviewer interaction. An instruction such as the following may improve potential item non-response, especially among Hispanic respondents. NOTE: Please answer BOTH Questions 1 and 2 (Hispanic or Latino and Race)5 Guideline 3: For data collection efforts requiring detailed Hispanic or Latino origin or race information, consider options to collect further information through write-in entries or follow-up questions asked by the interviewer. Write-in entries or follow-up questions would be most commonly used for ` other'responses such as Other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino, Other Pacific Islander, or Other Asian. Also, write-in or follow-up information may be desired to obtain the name of the enrolled or principles tribe for American Indian or Alaska Native responses. Questions shown in section 1.3.2 includes examples for write-in responses.  5  Modified version as shown in the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal forms 89   Guideline 4: Take mode carefully into account when designing questions and instructions.  This  guideline may seem obvious but it is often the case that surveys are conducted using a mixed mode (i.e., the initial interview attempt may be personal visit but a telephone interview is permissible). Since the questions should be designed with the mode in mind, there may need to be different versions of questions, depending on the mode of administration. Below is a brief discussion of some additional issues to consider depending on mode. For surveys conducted face-to-face by an interviewer, use of a flashcard is very helpful to the respondent. The wording of the question has to incorporate the instruction to look at the flashcard. Further, the design of the flashcard is important; it should clearly and neatly contain all available response categories. Similarly, the design, layout, and visual appearance of a self-administered questionnaire is very important and should be carefully considered. For telephone surveys, questions generally are shorter with fewer response categories. This presents a problem with questions that need to collect detailed information (see Guideline 3 discussed above). One solution may be to allow a follow-up question similar to the example shown in Section 1.3.4 that was tested to collect detailed Hispanic or Latino information. Using the race question as another example, if the respondent is read, Please select one or more to best describe your race. Are you White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander? and responds I am Asian, a follow-up question such as Which one of the following are you? Are you Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or from another Asian group? could be asked. Guideline 5: Provide definitions to the minimum race categories when possible. This guideline is particularly relevant when the short version (only the five minimum categories) of a race question is used. Individual interpretation of the five categories could lead to response error, especially for respondents unsure of the definitions of Asian and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. For self-administered forms, providing the definition of the category should be considered if space and formatting limitations can be overcome. For interviewer-administered questions, the definitions  90   should be readily available to the interviewer (usually in a manual that provides question-byquestion specifications) to assist the respondent if needed. Guideline 6: Adhere to the specific terminology as stated in the October 30, 1997 revised standards. The revised standards address the words and terms to use, and also indicates other terms that can be considered. For example, the name of the Black category should be Black or African American and additional terms such as Haitian or Negro can be used if desired. In another example, American Indian should be used and Native American should not be substituted for American Indian. Reviewing the terms specified in the revised standards is strongly encouraged before designing questions on race and Hispanic or Latino origin.  1.3.2 Examples of Hispanic or Latino Origin and Race Test Questions -Self-Administration6 Are you Spanish/Hispanic/Latino? 9 9 Yes No  Are you Spanish/Hispanic/Latino?

Phase II research will begin in Spring 1999 and conclude by July 31, 1999. Phase II will follow the same research design as Phase I but will be expanded geographically and will focus on testing with individuals who are Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and individuals with multiple racial heritage. In addition to research conducted by the committee, other studies could be initiated by agencies or interested groups. The committee expects to continue the review and modification of these guidelines as implementation occurs, feedback from agencies is received, and new research findings become available.  2.  Development and Testing of Aggregate Reporting Forms  A second goal of this research is to provide guidance on the design of reporting forms that will be used by administrative personnel to aggregate race and Hispanic or Latino origin data for a given population (e.g., reporting race and ethnicity for a school population, a jail population, etc). Implementing the revised standards will cause some fundamental changes to the ways in which race and Hispanic or Latino origin data have previously been aggregated and reported. In the past, agencies were required to report, at a minimum, the number of individuals who marked one of the four race categories, as well as the number of individuals who reported either Hispanic or Latino origin or not of Hispanic or Latino origin. A standard or prototype reporting form was not provided to Federal agencies. Rather, agencies developed their own forms depending on the characteristics of a given program and the data collection effort. The October 30, 1997 revised standards specify that, at a minimum, the number of individuals who marked one of the five race categories and the number who marked more than one race category are to be reported and that the race of those indicating Hispanic or Latino origin be reported if available. In many cases, greater detail about the combinations of specific multiple race responses 96   will be needed. The following are some of the decisions issued in the revised standards that impact the design of aggregate reporting forms. C When self-identification is not feasible or appropriate, a combined question can be used and should include a separate Hispanic or Latino category co-equal with the other categories. C When the combined format is used, an attempt should be made to record ethnicity and race but the option to indicate only one category (i.e., Hispanic or Latino, with no race designation) is acceptable. C When data are collected in a combined format and data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting ` Hispanic or Latino and one or more races'and the total number of respondents reporting ` more than one race'(regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided. C When data on race and ethnicity are collected separately, provision shall be made to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic or Latino. C In addition to providing the number of people who marked one of the five racial categories, data producers are strongly encouraged to provide the detailed distributions of multiple responses. At a minimum, the total number of respondents reporting ` more than one race' shall be made available. The committee' goal is to test different forms in order to offer guidelines to Federal agencies. s These guidelines should serve as a reference tool for agencies as they develop their own version of aggregate reporting forms based on agency data needs and program characteristics.  97   2.1  Research Design  The development of test forms has been a collaborative effort among the committee members, experts in questionnaire design and survey research, and policy and statistical analysts from the federal government who have been involved in the revision of standards for race and ethnicity data. In developing test forms, a decision was made to only use the minimum race categories specified in the revised standards. Thus, the forms only aggregate the numbers of American Indians or Alaska Natives, Asians, Blacks or African Americans, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, and Whites and do not aggregate subgroups such as Chinese, Japanese, Samoan, and so forth. However, any form could easily be extended in order to capture other subgroup data, and it is expected that agencies will develop forms that meet their specific data needs. Phase I is still in progress. Twenty cognitive interviews, 10 in cognitive laboratories and 10 on-site at establishments and agencies, are planned for this phase of the research. To test the forms, the subjects need to be familiar with reporting aggregate data for a given population (e.g., total numbers of students by demographic characteristics) but not necessarily familiar with the revised standards. For Phase I, participants are recruited mostly through committee contacts with representatives in various Federal, state and local agencies as well as those in the private sector. Three different forms have been developed for testing purposes. The committee recognized from the outset that many organizations collect and maintain data at the individual level that includes Hispanic or Latino co-equal with other race categories. However, the design of the forms was an attempt to see how subjects would approach the task of aggregating separate Hispanic or Latino counts with the expectation that in the future, agencies will gradually modify the ways in which individual race and Hispanic or Latino origin data are collected. A brief description of each form follows.  98   C  Form RH-1 is designed to collect the specific reports of race and record these by the Hispanic or Latino origin responses. There are 31 reporting lines representing every combination of both single and multiple race responses for the five minimum race categories. Total numbers for each race group are then entered under one of three Hispanic or Latino origin status columns: Yes, of Hispanic or Latino origin; No, not of Hispanic or Latino origin; No Hispanic or Latino origin information provided. This form conceptualizes what an automated data collection format would include. It can easily be expanded or reduced depending on the specific race combinations listed.  C  Form RH-2 has two parts. First, it asks for the aggregate number of individuals who reported each single race, the number of individuals who reported more than one race, and the number of individuals for whom race information is missing. Second, for records of individuals who reported more than one race, the form then asks for a count of the number of times each race was included in a multiple race response. These numbers are reported in one of three columns: Hispanic or Latinos, non-Hispanic or Latinos, or separate Hispanic or Latino origin question but with no answer given.  C  Form RH-3 has two parts and is similar conceptually to RH-2. However, it is designed to report aggregated race data crosstabulated with other variables. RH-3A asks for the aggregate number of individuals who reported each single race and the aggregate number of individuals who reported more than one race crosstabulated by Hispanic or Latino origin and gender. RH-3B is completed only for records reporting more than one race. The number of times each race was indicated is then crosstabulated by Hispanic or Latino origin and gender.  2.2  Results  Expert panel: A panel comprised of questionnaire design specialists and experts well-versed in aggregate reporting by establishments was convened in July 1998 to discuss draft forms for testing. Results indicated that the test forms were too complicated and should be redesigned so that they 99   would be easy to complete with little or no instructions. There were many reformatting suggestions, such as trying to follow the step-by-step narrative approach used by Internal Revenue Service tax forms that guide a respondent in calculating and entering a numeric report. Also, several of the experts thought that a reporting form should be developed that allowed for the aggregation of Hispanic or Latino origin individuals co-equal with individuals reporting race information; this suggestion was based on the knowledge that current practice among many institutions is to collect individual race and ethnicity data using a combined format. The feedback from the expert panel led to three significant changes in the test forms. First, one form was redesigned to allow for the aggregate reporting of every combination of multiple race responses (among the five minimum race categories). A second form was redesigned to capture single race responses, the total count of multiple race responses, and the number of times a racial group was reported within multiple race combinations. Using Asian reports as an example, the second form was designed to aggregate the total number of students who reported only Asian and the total number of students who reported Asian plus one or more other races. Third, a form was redesigned to provide a template for crosstabulating race reports with other demographic data. Cognitive interviews: Fourteen interviews have been accomplished thus far, 7 in cognitive laboratories and 7 on-site. Of the 14 respondents interviewed, 5 were Federal government personnel, 6 worked in private industry, 2 worked in local correctional facilities, and 1 worked in a school. For the laboratory testing, subjects were given ` dummy'records of applications that contained multiple race responses as well as combined Hispanic or Latino origin and race questions. Dummy records were used in order to see how subjects would complete the forms based on different kinds of source data. Examples of the questions used in the dummy records are below followed by the results of testing each of the three forms. For testing conducted on-site, actual agency records were used. Attachment B contains the general interview protocol. Attachment D shows the progress to date by test condition.  100   Example 1 - Combined format used on dummy records Race: Mark one or more 01 9 White 02 9 Black or African American 03 9 Hispanic or Latino 04 9 American Indian or Alaska Native 05 9 Asian 06 9 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander  Example 2 - Two question format used on dummy records 9.

Race: 01 9 02 9 03 9 04 9 05 9 Mark one or more White Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander  2.2.1 Form RH-1 This form has been tested with four subjects. There were no appreciable differences between the laboratory and on-site interviews other than the fact that the agency data used on-site was substantially different than the data elements for Form RH-1. While Form RH-1 is the easiest of the three forms to complete, the subjects demonstrated some difficulty grasping the concept of multiple race responses and said the form appeared complex when they first looked at it. Several subjects stated that a separate set of instructions on how to complete the form is needed. One subject reviewed the form and did not think it provided all the needed reporting categories because Hispanic was not listed as a race. Even though the subject noticed that there was an individual column for Hispanic individuals to be reported, he was confused because Hispanic was not listed among the rows with the other race groups. 101   Once subjects began to complete the form, they were able to adapt to its format and report numbers accurately in the correct rows. However, entering the correct number in the appropriate Hispanic column remained a problem. One subject stated ""Everything was pretty straightforward and I really didn' have any difficulty filling out my employees...but why are there three Hispanic t columns? Why is the focus there? It seems sort of arbitrary."" In particular, subjects seemed to have the most difficulty knowing where to report Hispanic individuals with no race information.  RH-1 form and instructions will be revised prior to further testing. The revised form will only have two Hispanic columns (Yes, of Hispanic or Latino origin; No, not of Hispanic or Latino origin) because subjects had a lot of difficulty discriminating between the column Individuals who marked NO, Hispanic origin and the column Individuals who did not provide Hispanic origin information.7 The revised RH-1 will also attempt to make clearer where to record individuals for whom no race information is available. Last, an improved set of instructions will be developed and tested. Following is a sample of part of the form that was tested followed by the test instructions.  RH-1 as well as RH-2 and RH-3 used Hispanic origin rather than Hispanic or Latino origin. This was an oversight that will be corrected in future testing. 102  7   FORM RH-1  Individuals who marked YES, Hispanic Origin 1 White 2 Black/African American 3 Asian 4 American Indian/Alaska Native 5 Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander 6 White + Black/African Am. 7 White + Asian 8 White + Am Indian/Alaska Nat.  Individuals who marked NO, Hispanic Origin  Individuals who did NOT provide Hispanic Origin information  Individuals who marked ONLY ONE race  Individuals who marked TWO races  9 White + Nat Hawaiian/OPI 10 Black/African Am + Asian 11 Black/African Am + Am Indian/Alaska 12 Black/African Am + Nat Hawaiian/OPI 13 Asian + Am Indian/Alaska Nat. 14 Asian + Nat Hawaiian/OPI  Race missing Total  32 Individuals who DID NOT provide race information 33 Total population Sum of rows 1 through 32  NOTE: Form RH-1 contains rows 15-31 which are rows for individuals who marked three, four, and five race groups. For space reasons, only the first third of the form is shown above.  103   RH-1 INSTRUCTIONS When completing this form, please note: 1. 2. 3. We are requesting separate counts for individuals who mark only one race and for those who mark more than one race-- one race, two races, three races, etc. For the purposes of this form, 'Hispanic' is an ethnic group and is not a race. If you are entering information for individuals of Hispanic origin for whom no race data are available, please enter these individuals in your count on Line 32, 'Individuals who DID NOT provide race information' and Column (1) 'Individuals who marked YES, Hispanic origin'. If you do not have any racial/ethnic information for individuals, or the information your organization has does not fit a racial/ethnic category, then please enter these individuals in your count in Row 32 'Individuals who DID NOT provide race information' and Column (3) 'Individuals who did not provide Hispanic Origin information'.  4.  2.2.2 Form RH-2 Form RH-2 has been tested with eight subjects and has undergone several revisions. As found in Form RH-1, participants interviewed on-site as well as the laboratory subjects using a combined race/ethnicity dummy record were the most confused because the test form separates counts of Hispanics from counts of race groups which is not currently done at their agency or organization. With one exception, the subjects interviewed both in the laboratory and on-site were not experienced in manually aggregating data from individual source documents. Rather, they were familiar working with data already aggregated and contained in automated files, most of which include Hispanic as one of the race/ethnicity reporting categories. For example, one subject stated ""The only one I got confused and stumped on was ....under the multi-race count... It was hard for me not to treat Hispanic as a race category. I guess I' been trained and indoctrinated."" A ve second subject said ""It' basically asking how Hispanics were separated into groups of races. I s think the part that confuses me is that our Hispanics do not view themselves as another race. And 104   so that is kind of what threw me off... it' asking for Hispanics who had marked ` s White,'but they don' They would have checked Hispanic."" t. Whether in the laboratory or on-site, all subjects were confused at first by the second half of the form which requires the reporting of the number of times a race was marked among the multiple race responses. Below is a modified portion of the form that asks for these counts. As indicated in the RH-1 discussion, Form RH-2 will be revised prior to further testing.  FORM RH-2  REPORTING MULTIPLE RACES  Count of TIMES each race was marked for individuals who marked MORE THAN 1 race Number of times WHITE was marked  Hispanics  NON Hispanics  Separate Hispanic Origin Question with no answer given  Number of times BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN was marked  Number of times ASIAN was marked  Number of times AMERICAN INDIAN/ ALASKA NATIVE was marked Number of times NATIVE HAWAIIAN / OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER was marked  105   2.2.3 Form RH-3 Two interviews were completed with Form RH-3. Neither subject completed the form accurately or seemed to understand its intent. This form allows for race information to be crosstabulated by other demographic information. The top portion of the form is shown below. The two subjects interviewed only had experience working with automated data and therefore, had no experience or knowledge of the tasks involved in manually aggregating responses. One subject, a Federal government EEO officer, stated that Hispanic is considered a race and she demonstrated difficulty in not knowing where to report Hispanic individuals as well as what to do for Hispanic or Latino individuals who also mark one race (Should I count this as a multiple race count?). The other subject did not understand the form at all and was only familiar with producing aggregate reports from automated data systems. Form RH-3 needs some additional testing before revisions can be made.  FORM RH-3A  AGGREGATE REPORTING OF POPULATION BY RACE, HISPANIC ORIGIN AND GENDER  Hispanic and Gender Characteristics  Individuals Who Marked Only ONE Race White Black/ African American Asian American Indian/ Alaska Native Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific  Individuals Who Marked MORE THAN ONE Race  Individuals Who Did NOT Report Race  Total Pop  Total Population Hispanic Male Female Total Not Hispanic Male Female Total No Hispanic Information Male Female Total  106   2.3  Methodological Problems  Based on the laboratory interviews, on-site visits, and discussions with many state and local government personnel and personnel working in private industry, several methodological problems regarding the development and testing of aggregate reporting forms were identified. Differences between the format of the individual (source) data and the format of the aggregate form: One of the problems in trying to test a prototype form that would assist agencies in developing aggregate reporting methods is that the format of the individual data varies across programs, agencies, and organizations. To develop an aggregate reporting form, general questionnaire design principles would call for using the same or similar categories as those used for the individual data. For example, if the individual data uses a combined race/ethnicity question in which Hispanic or Latino is one of the response options, then one would expect to design an aggregate form that follows the source data convention. Through interviews and discussions with a variety of data reporters, members of the committee found that a combined race/ethnicity question has been used often and that a variety of terms and words are used to represent a race category. Thus, subjects have difficulty complying with the testing task because they are essentially being asked to reformat and redefine their data in order to complete the test form. Regardless of whether an agency is using a combined question or whether an agency is using the terms set forth in the revised standards, the point here is that data reporters expect an aggregate form to be similar conceptually to individual records. Since the test forms were developed independent of what the individual records contain, the test forms were perceived as unsuitable for reporting agency race and ethnicity data. To illustrate this problem, at one corrections center, the racial identification is made by the arresting officer and includes the categories: (1) Black, (2) White, (3) Oriental, (4) Indian, (5) Black Hispanic, (6) White Hispanic, (7) Oriental Hispanic, (8) Indian Hispanic, and (9) unknown. The information is made by observation, and it is unclear to what extent Hispanic information is assessed accurately. At a different corrections center in the same state, race and ethnicity data are automated 107   and keyed using two separate fields as follows: (B) Black, (A) Asian/Pacific Islander/Oriental, (I) American Indian/Alaska Native, (C) Caucasian, and (U) Unknown; in a separate field either (H) Hispanic is entered or the field is left blank. The data are obtained from a police officer who records it on an intake form which is then keyed at the time of entrance to the facility. The database at this facility allows for missing/unknown race information which the subject said accounts for roughly 10% of the facility population. Neither one of these subjects worked easily with the test form because it was so different from their agency' individual source data and aggregate reports they have completed in the past. s Difficulties in performing a complicated manual task. A second testing problem was that only one subject was familiar with manual aggregating and reporting of race and ethnicity data. One of the committee' underlying assumptions was that if manual reporting forms were developed and tested, s they could then easily be adapted to automated reporters. While this may be true, the testing process itself was strained because the individuals interviewed had considerable difficulty applying their data reporting process to manual completion of the test forms. Improving the instructions will partially reduce this problem but redesigning the forms is necessary too. Visual appearance of the forms: The committee recognized that the forms look complicated. While it was thought that draft forms would suffice for testing purposes, the importance of the appearance and layout of the forms were underestimated. Prior to further testing, the forms will be redesigned to look more professional and reduce the initial perception of complexity. Mix of laboratory and on-site tests: Conducting both laboratory and on-site visits is methodologically much more complicated than had been foreseen. Simply put, testing in the laboratory using dummy records is not similar enough to a like task at an agency level. This is because the laboratory subjects actually performed the task of categorizing and manually aggregating data in order to fill out the test form. On-site, however, the data the subjects worked with for testing were already aggregated and therefore, the task was substantially different and subjects could not simply disaggregate the data as needed to fill out the form. This problem can be partially remedied by developing different protocols for laboratory and on-site tests as well as 108   ensuring that the interview is conducted with a staff member who has access to the individual source data. 2.4 Guidelines for Aggregate Reporting of Race and Ethnicity Data  As referred to previously, the Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity issued on October 30, 1997 set forth principles that should be followed when aggregating race and ethnicity data for Federal reporting purposes. The committee tested three different reporting forms with the hopes of providing guidelines to agencies for the development of new reporting forms. None of the three forms as tested are recommended for use. However, results of the fourteen interviews suggest that minor revisions and improved formatting of Form RH-1 may work for agencies that collect each multiple race combination reported. The Phase II revision of Form RH-1, along with improved instructions, may also serve to help develop computer specifications for those who will be developing automated reporting systems. For agencies that need a total number of multiple race responses followed by the number of times each race was reported, the concepts underlying Forms RH-2 and RH-3 will provide the data needed and may be worth pursuing. However, the current forms need substantial revision and, more importantly, considerable attention still needs to be paid to developing instructions that are easy to understand and will lead to accurate completion of the forms. A remaining problem that can only be overcome in time is the need for agencies to change the way individual data are collected. Redesign of the forms will not address the disconnect between the format of the individual data and the format of aggregate forms that meet the revised standards. A few general guidelines, though, can be offered at this point and should be considered by agencies as they move forward with implementing the revised standards.  109   Guideline 1: If possible, allow for the reporting of every combination of multiple race responses. A system that collects every multiple race combination along with Hispanic or Latino origin information will allow the maximum flexibility for an agency in further reporting and analysis. It would be expected that only automated systems could achieve this, unless the population sizes for a given agency or organization are small enough to allow manual record keeping and tabulations. Most of interviews thus far confirmed that for agencies that automate individual records, new combinations of multiple races could be incorporated into their current systems.8 Practically, though, modifying a reporting system to accept numerous combinations of race and ethnicity reports has several difficulties, most notably (1) the burden associated with reporting at least 62 issue of data suppression due to confidentiality and privacy concerns. Guideline 2: Professionally design the form and include clear instructions. Taking care to professionally design a reporting form may seem obvious but the need for this is heightened when the form is complex and appears difficult to complete. Many future respondents reporting race and ethnicity data will be working with new terms and concepts and therefore, may be more prone to error if instructions are not clear and completion of forms are not self-evident. In particular, instructions must address what the reporter should do if the individual data has been collected using a combined format. Guideline 3: Provide definitions that assist in understanding the concepts of single race reports and multiple race reports as well as the distinction between ethnicity and race. These definitions might be able to be integrated into the instructions accompanying the form or on the form itself. Another option is to develop an information sheet that explains these and other relevant definitions. 9  unique combinations of race and Hispanic or Latino origin crossed by other variables and (2) the  Contacts at establishments have stated that the costs of modifying their current automated systems may be high and that accommodating a reporting change would require a decision at senior management levels. The figure of 62 is based upon the possible combinations of 5 race categories and 2 ethnicity categories (Yes or No regarding Hispanic or Latino origin). The figure could be substantially higher if subgroups (e.g., Japanese, Samoan, Cuban, Puerto Rican, etc.) are used when collecting race and ethnicity data as well as combinations that account for missing race data and missing Hispanic or Latino origin data. 9  8  110   Guideline 4: Explain how the respondent should treat different kinds of missing data. One clear problem that emerged in the cognitive testing was that respondents were unsure how to handle missing data. Missing data can take a variety of forms (i.e, Hispanic is reported but race data is missing; race is reported but Hispanic information is missing) and each type should be addressed to avoid reporting errors. 2.5 Continuing Research on Aggregate Reporting of Race and Ethnicity  Phase I will be completed by April 1, 1999. Phase II will begin in the Spring 1999 and be completed by July 31, 1999. Its research design is currently being revised and may include further testing and refinement of forms and instructions. It may also include a more focused effort to conduct on-site visits with various agencies to better understand the reporting problems posed by aggregate reporting of race and ethnicity data. It is relevant to note that many of the problems identified in this research are not new and have been known and documented in the past. Phase II will concentrate on developing guidelines that will inform the reporting process, improve data quality, and assist data reporters in aggregating data containing multiple race responses. 3.0 Field Instructions and Training Procedures  Work to develop interview instructions and interviewer training procedures will begin in the Spring of 1999 and conclude on July 31, 1999. Different training modules and interviewer instructions depending on the mode of administration and the type of data collection will be developed and hopefully tested by organizations involved in data collection operations. Work on field instruction and training will, in all likeliness, not address new issues or problems. For example, some household interviewers have for years been using flashcards for race questions and are experienced in helping a respondent understand response categories and so forth. However, since the revised standards do encompass several distinct changes, it seems timely to address in a more systematic way issues in the fielding of the questions, and ways that interviewers can be trained to improve data quality. Specific procedures on how to ask the questions and, in some 111   cases, how to instruct the respondent to use the flashcard will be developed as well as suggested interviewer probes, definitions, and statements that can be used to answer respondent questions. It is known from past surveys that at a minimum, guidance should be provided regarding the following: C What should the interviewer say if the response is multiracial, biracial, or some other term or phrase without a specific race combination mentioned? C What should the interviewer say if the response is Hispanic, Latino, or some other term indicating Hispanic or Latino origin? C What are the general probes and/or definitions that interviewers should use for responses such as American, Swedish, Jewish, and so forth? C What is the interviewer response to a refusal or a response of ""other?""  112   Some Suggested References and Helpful Readings Aday, L. (1989).

Today, we are asking for your help in testing a new form which asks for some general information about the people who work in your agency (organization, firm). We have found that the best way to design these forms is to try them out with a variety of people to see how easy or hard they are to complete. What I would like you to do is first look at the form and tell me what you think it is asking you to do. There are no right or wrong answers but your first impression will help us understand how other people will interpret the purpose of the form. Then, I' like you to try to fill it out without d asking me to help you. After completing the form, I will ask you some questions about your answers, and you can also tell me more about what you like and don' like about the form. t Before we begin, do you have any questions to ask of me? (If yes, answer as neutrally as possible. If specific to questionnaire, tell respondent we will talk about this later). Okay. Here' the form. Please take a minute to look at it and then I' ask you some questions. s ll  1. Can you tell me in your own words what this form is asking you to do?  2. What is your general reaction to the form?  3. How easy or difficult is it to understand? Are you pretty sure you know what to do or are you confused?  122   Now before you try to fill it out, I have a task for you to do. After you are done with the task, you might have a better idea of how to complete the form. NOTE: On-site establishment interviews are conducted using the organization' personnel s data. Lab interviews are conducted by giving participants 100 ""dummy"" records.  Pretend that your school/organization gained 100 new students/employees during the year. You are responsible for reporting the race and Hispanic or Latino origin of those 100 students/employees to your boss. For example, your boss wants to know how many white were students/employees, how many black or African American students/employees, etc.  Now, I would like to let you know about some recent changes in OMB reporting requirements. First of all, it is specified that respondents may select more than one race.  Second, the category Asian/Pacific Islander has been broken out into two categories: Asian and Native Hawaiian.  You may want to use these blanks sheets as worksheets to extract the information from these records of your 100 new students/employees.  Now use these numbers to fill out the form. If you aren' sure what to do, try to guess rather than t ask me a question. (make a note if you have a question) We can talk afterwards about what you are unsure of.  123   DEBRIEFING QUESTIONS 1. Now that you have worked with the form, can you tell me in your own words what the form asked you to do?  2.  What question or questions does your agency ask to obtain race/ethnicity data from its students (clients)?  3.  How well would this form work for report racial and ethnic data in your current data system?  4.  How are your school's/company' race/ethnicity data broken out? s  5.  Do your records include multi-racial data? If yes, would you be able to categorize it in a way that you could complete this form?  6.  How did you arrive at your numbers? Go over with me the parts of the form you completed and what you did to enter the number.  7.  What does (racial group) mean to you?  8.  What does the Hispanic or Latino instruction mean to you?  9.  What does single race only on this form mean to you?  10.  What does plus one or more other races on this form mean to you? 124   11.  Were there any items on this form that you think some people might find difficult? If so, which ones? Why? (What makes them difficult?)  12.  What about the amount of detail that this form asks for... . Do you think the form asks for enough detail? Do you think the form asks for too much detail?  13.  What did you like about the form?  14.  What did you dislike about the form?  15.  Were there any questions that you find sensitive? If so, which ones?  16.  Is there anything on this form that you think we should change? If yes, what are those changes?  17.  How did you interpret the 'total population' boxes?  18.  Did you have any records that you couldn' fit into one of the boxes? Where did you put t people whom you couldn't fit into a category? How have you handled situations like this in the past? How long would it take for you to gather the information to complete this form? What did you think about the instructions? What should be changed? Before today, were you aware of the Federal Government' recent revision to race and s ethnicity standards and that multiple race responses are now acceptable in government surveys? 125  19. 20. 21.   ATTACHMENT C: TESTING PLAN AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS OF JANUARY 11, 1999 SELF-REPORTED RACE AND HISPANIC ORIGIN QUESTIONS Condition Interview Mode Hispanic Question Race Question Race and Ethnic Background of Subject' Mother and Father s American Indian Asian Black/Af.

The guidance presented in this document is intended for any Federal agencies or organizational units that maintain, collect, or present data on race and ethnicity for Federal statistical purposes, program administrative reporting, or civil rights compliance reporting. This is a substantially updated version of the earlier guidance that was made available in February 1999. It reflects public comments on the previous version as well as the Tabulation Working Group's further research and deliberations. The guidance, which was requested by Federal agencies and the many users of data on race and ethnicity, continues to be developed with the involvement of these constituencies. By design, this guidance does not cover all of the specific issues individual agencies will need to address during their implementation of the 1997 standards. The guidance for implementing the 1997 standards focuses on three areas: collecting data, tabulating data, and building bridges to compare data collected under the 1997 and the 1977 standards. In some areas work is ongoing, and the guidance will be updated as additional research and analyses are completed. We expect that the guidance will evolve further as data from Census 2000 and other data collections employing the 1997 collection standards become available, as agencies address implementation issues in their respective programs, and as additional research needs are identified and addressed. In keeping with the process that guided the development of the 1997 standards for data on race and ethnicity, we are looking forward to a continuing dialogue on this provisional guidance. We welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions. Katherine K.

The guidance complements the Federal Government's decision in October 1997 to provide an opportunity for individuals to select one or more races when responding to agency requests for data on race and ethnicity. To foster comparability across data collections carried out by various agencies, it is useful for those agencies to report responses of more than one race using some standardized tabulations or formats. The report briefly explains why the tabulation guidelines are needed, reviews the general guidance issued when the standards were adopted in October 1997, and provides information on the criteria used in developing the guidelines. This report also addresses a larger set of implementation questions that have emerged during the working group's deliberations. Thus, the report considers: C C C C Collecting data on race and ethnicity using the 1997 standards; Tabulating Census 2000 data as well as data on race and ethnicity collected in surveys and from administrative records; Using data on race and ethnicity in applications such as legislative redistricting, civil rights monitoring and enforcement, and population estimates; and Comparing data under the 1997 and the 1977 standards when conducting trend analyses.  In addition, the appendices to the report provide the full text of reports on the research that has been conducted in two areas: approaches for collecting data on race and ethnicity, and approaches for bridging between data collected under the 1997 standards and data collected under the 1977 standards. The guidelines are necessarily provisional pending the availability of data from Census 2000 and other data systems as the 1997 standards are implemented. The guidelines provide a general framework and are not intended to cover all aspects of problems that agencies will encounter during their implementation of the 1997 standards. In some instances, for example, specific implementation issues are being address through OMB's paperwork review of data collections. The guidelines are likely to be reviewed and refined as Federal agencies and others gain experience with data collected under the 1997 standards. 5   CHAPTER 1 BACKGROUND This chapter discusses why guidance is needed for tabulating data collected using the 1997 standards, reiterates the general guidance issued when the standards were adopted in October 1997, provides clarification of several aspects of the standards, and presents the criteria that were developed for evaluating bridging methods and presenting data. A. Need for Tabulation Guidelines On October 30, 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published ""Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity"" (Federal Register, 62 FR 58781 - 58790)(see Appendix A). The 1997 standards reflect a change in data collection policy, making it possible for Federal agencies to collect information that reflects the increasing diversity of our Nation's population stemming from growth in interracial marriages and immigration. Under the new policy, agencies are now required to offer respondents the option of selecting one or more of the following five racial categories included in the 1997 standards: -- American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. -- Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. -- Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used in addition to ""Black or African American."" -- Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. -- White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. These five categories are the minimum set for data on race for Federal statistics, program administrative reporting, and civil rights compliance reporting. With respect to ethnicity, the standards provide for the collection of data on whether or not a person is of ""Hispanic or Latino"" culture or origin. (The standards do not permit a multiple response that would indicate an ethnic heritage that is both ""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino."") This category is defined as follows: 6   -- Hispanic or Latino. A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, ""Spanish origin,"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic or Latino."" As a result of the change in policy for collecting data on race, the reporting categories used to present these data must similarly reflect this change. In keeping with the spirit of the 1997 standards, agencies cannot collect multiple responses and then report and publish data using only the five single race categories. Agencies are expected to provide as much detail as possible on the multiple race responses, consistent with agency confidentiality and data quality criteria. As provided by the standards, OMB will consider any agency variances to this policy on a case by case basis. Based on agency research prior to the issuance of the 1997 standards, it was estimated that less than two percent of the Nation's total population was likely to identify with more than one race. This percentage may increase as those who identify with more than one racial heritage become aware of the opportunity to report more than one race. As compared with data collected on adults, data collected on children and youth, however, are likely to reflect larger numbers and percentages of respondents reporting themselves as belonging to more than one racial group. In the early years of the standards' implementation, there will be issues of data quality and confidentiality related to sample size that may restrict the amount of data that can be published for some combinations of multiple race responses. Over time, however, the size of these data cells may increase. It should be noted that such data quality and confidentiality problems for small population groups also existed under the 1977 standards, where sample sizes sometimes prevented presentation of data on certain population groups such as American Indians. The possible multiple race combinations under the 1997 standards, some with small data cells, serve to make such data quality concerns more apparent. Some balance will need to be struck between having a tabulation showing the full distribution of all possible combinations of multiple race responses and presenting only the minimum -- that is, a single aggregate of people who reported more than one race. When the standards were announced on October 30, 1997, they became effective immediately for all new and revised Federal record keeping or reporting requirements that included data on race and ethnicity. All existing Federal record keeping or reporting requirements must be made consistent with the provisions of the 1997 standards at the time they are submitted to OMB for extension through the reports clearance process, or no later than January 1, 2003. As provided by the standards, an agency must make a request to OMB for any variation from the standards. B. General Guidelines for Tabulating Data on Race In response to concerns that had been raised about how Federal agencies would tabulate multiple race responses, OMB in the October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice issued the following general guidance: 7   C  Consistent with criteria for confidentiality and data quality, the tabulation procedures used by the agencies should result in the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as possible. Guidelines for tabulation ultimately must meet the needs of at least two groups within the Federal Government, with the overriding objective of providing the most accurate and informative body of data. The first group is composed of those Federal Government officials charged with carrying out constitutional and legislative mandates, such as redistricting legislatures, enforcing civil rights laws, and monitoring progress in antidiscrimination programs. (The legislative redistricting file produced by the Bureau of the Census, also known as the Public Law 94-171 file, is an example of a file meeting such legislative needs.) The second group consists of the staff of Federal statistical agencies producing and analyzing data that are used to monitor economic and social conditions and trends. Many of the needs of the first group can be met with an initial tabulation that provides, consistent with standards for data quality and confidentiality, the full detail of racial reporting; that is, the number of people reporting in each single race category and the number reporting in each of the possible combinations of races, which would add to the total population. Depending on the judgment of users, the combinations of multiple responses could be collapsed. (1) One method would be to provide separate totals for those reporting in the most common multiple race combinations and to collapse the data for other less frequently reported combinations. The specifics of the collapsed distributions would be dependent on the results of particular data collections. (2) A second method would be to report the total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination with other races. These totals would represent upper bounds on the size of the populations who identified with each of the racial categories. In some cases, this latter method could be used for comparing data collected under the old standards with data collected under the 1997 standards.  C  C  C  C C  It is important that Federal agencies with the same or closely related responsibilities adopt consistent tabulation methods. Regardless of the method chosen for collapsing multiple race responses, Federal agencies must make available the total number reporting more than one race, if confidentiality and data quality requirements can be met, in order to ensure that any changes in response patterns resulting from the 1997 standards can be monitored over time.  8     Different tabulation procedures might be required to meet various needs of Federal agencies for data on race. Nevertheless, Federal agencies often need to compare racial and ethnic data. Hence, some standardization of tabulation categories for reporting data on race is desirable to facilitate such comparisons.  The October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice identified four areas where further research was needed on how to tabulate data: (1) How should the data be used to evaluate conformance with program objectives in the area of equal employment opportunity and other anti-discrimination programs? (2) How should the decennial census data for many small population groups with multiple racial heritages be used to develop sample designs and survey controls for major demographic surveys? (3) How should the 1997 standards be introduced in the vital statistics program which obtains the number of births and deaths from administrative records, but uses intercensal population estimates in determining the rates of births and deaths? (4) And more generally, how can meaningful comparisons be made of data collected under the previous standards and data that will be collected under the 1997 standards? In order to address these and other issues and to ensure that tabulation methodologies would be carefully developed and coordinated among the Federal agencies, OMB assembled a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from the Federal agencies that generate or use these data. This group has considered tabulation issues and developed the provisional guidance that is presented in this report for use by Federal agencies. The work of this group has included: (1) a review of Federal data needs and uses to ensure that the tabulation guidelines produce data that meet statutory and program requirements; (2) cognitive testing of the wording of questions; (3) cognitive testing of a form for reporting aggregate data; (4) evaluation of different methods of bridging from the 1997 to the 1977 standards; and (5) development of guidelines for presenting data on multiple race responses that meet accepted data quality and confidentiality standards. The tabulation guidance in this report is necessarily provisional pending the availability of Census 2000 data and other data series as the 1997 standards are implemented. These guidelines will be reviewed and modified as agencies and other data users gain experience with data collected using the 1997 standards. C. Interpretation of Self-Reported Data on Race It is important to remember that the Federal racial and ethnic data categories are social-political constructs and that they should not be interpreted as being genetic, biological, or anthropological in nature. Data on race and ethnicity have historically been collected in the decennial census, 9   but the categories for collecting and tabulating these data have changed numerous times. These changes have reflected the shifts in the racial makeup of the population and changes in social attitudes and political concerns. The standard was developed in the mid-1970's in large measure to provide comparable data to monitor equal access in areas such as housing, education, mortgage lending, health care services, and employment for population groups that historically had experienced discrimination and differential treatment because of their race or ethnicity. By using the standard to tabulate data in these areas by race and ethnicity, it is possible to compare disparities across data systems. While the Federal categories provide a standardized format for purposes of collecting and presenting data on race and ethnicity, the standard was not designed to capture the full complexity of race and ethnicity in the United States. This context is important for understanding why the Federal Government collects data on race and ethnicity and for interpreting these data. The 1997 standards emphasize self-reporting or self-identification as the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. The standards do not establish criteria or qualifications (such as blood quantum levels) that are to be used in determining a particular individual's racial or ethnic classification. They do not tell an individual who he or she is, or specify how an individual should classify himself or herself. Self-identification for race and Hispanic or Latino origin means that the responses are based on self-perception and therefore are subjective, but by definition, the responses are accurate. In situations where self-reporting is not practicable or feasible, such as identification by personnel of funeral homes, observer identification may be used. Because the 1997 standard allows individuals to report one or more races, the importance of self-identification is underscored; it is generally difficult for observers to report an individual's multiple racial heritages. As mentioned above, a consequence of using self-identification is that unless a person is purposely misreporting, there are no wrong answers even if ""objective"" clues suggest otherwise. This contrasts with the collection of information on other demographic characteristics. For example, if someone born on January 1, 1950, indicates that he or she is 30 years of age when asked on January 1, 2000, the researcher views this as an error and corrects the information. The use of self-identification coupled with the social nature of race also results in situations where an individual's response to questions on race may change over time as a result of the maturation process, the particular situation, and the changing environment. If a data collection strategy used to measure age were to produce such results, that strategy would be abandoned; in the case of race, however, such change is acceptable and expected. The dynamic nature of the concept of race and how the population views it as well as the circumstances under which the data are collected need to be considered in the interpretation and analysis of these data. An example of how the social dimension of race is incorporated into the collection of information is the large increase in the percent of the population identifying as American Indians between the 1970 and 1980 censuses. A standard interpretation of population increase focuses on the basic demographic processes of mortality, natality, and immigration. In this instance, these processes could not explain this increase. On the other hand, it would be equally wrong to 10   conclude that persons misreported their race in either 1970 or 1980. The increase reflects societal changes related to the perception of American Indian heritage and how these changes affect how individuals self-identify. Another example relates to multiple race identity. One way to define ""objectively"" a multiple race individual would be to assess the race of each of the parents. It is possible to identify a population in this way from data sets that collect information on the characteristics of family members. This approach becomes increasingly complex in situations where parents are also of multiple races, leading to questions about how much of a given racial heritage the respondent considers ""enough"" to report. Analyses show that not all persons with parents of different races identify as having more than one race. It also appears that the probability of identifying multiple races changes with the age of the individual as well as with the specific races of the parents. How individuals come to their self-identification is an important research issue that would require collection of data beyond the minimum set of categories and which would not be feasible to incorporate into all data collection systems. In interpreting and evaluating the results of analyses that are based on data collected using the 1997 standards, it is important to remember that the approach can only capture selected aspects of a complex dimension, and that what is captured will be affected by strong and complex social processes. As more detailed data are collected, and analyses that directly address these social processes are conducted, the interpretation of the information collected more routinely under the 1997 standard will be clearer. D. Points of Clarification Regarding the 1997 Standards This section elaborates on several points in the standards that have been a source of confusion for some users. Under the 1997 standards, ""Hispanic or Latino"" is clearly designated as an ethnicity and not as a race. Whether or not an individual is Hispanic or Latino, every effort should be made to ascertain the race or races with which an individual identifies. The two-question format, with the ethnicity question preceding the race question, should be used when information is collected through self-identification. Although the standards permit the use of a combined question when collecting data by observer identification, the use of the twoquestion format is strongly encouraged even where observer identification is used. Regardless of the question format, observers are expected to attempt to identify the individual's race(s). The standards require that at a minimum the total number of persons identifying with more than one race be reported. (A response that includes, for example, two or more Asian groups is not a multiple race response.) It is stressed that this is a minimum; agencies are strongly encouraged to report detailed information on specific racial combinations subject to constraints of data 11   reliability and confidentiality standards. In this regard, agencies are expected to report only those categories that meet their current reliability and confidentiality standards. Thus, the reporting of individual categories is likely to be more detailed when the overall racial distribution is reported than when characteristics by race (such as, for example, income by race ) are reported. The following wording in the standards concerning the reporting of data when the combined question is used is clarified in the paragraph below: ""In cases where data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting `Hispanic or Latino and one or more races' and the total number of respondents reporting `more than one race' (regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided."" (Section 2b of the standards) A complete tabulation of race by ethnicity should always be reported when confidentiality permits. If not, at least ethnicity by the single races and ethnicity for those reporting more than one race should be given. Thus, an Hispanic or Latino respondent reporting one race should be reported both as Hispanic or Latino and as a member of that single race. Reporting a composite - - such as the number of people who responded ""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""more than one race"" -- is a minimum that should be used only if more detailed reporting would violate data reliability and confidentiality standards. The rules discussed in Section 4 of the 1997 standards concerning the presentation of data on race and ethnicity under special circumstances are not to be invoked unilaterally by an agency. If the agency believes the standard categories are inappropriate, the agency must request a specific variance from OMB. The 1997 standards do not include an ""other race"" category. For Census 2000, OMB granted an exception to the Census Bureau to use a category called ""Some Other Race."" OMB has also granted an exception to the National Center for Health Statistics to include ""Some Other Race"" on the U.S. standard birth and death certificates in order to maintain comparability between the demographically related data systems of vital statistics and the decennial census. E. Criteria Used in Developing the Tabulation Guidelines The interagency tabulation working group generated criteria that could be used both to evaluate the technical merits of different bridging procedures (see Chapter 5 and Appendix C) and to display data under the 1997 standards. The relative importance of each criterion will depend on the purpose for which the data are intended to be used. For example, in the case of bridging to the 1977 standards, the most important criterion is ""measuring change over time,"" while ""congruence with respect to respondent's choice"" will be more critical for presenting data under the 1997 standards.  12   The criteria set forth below are designed only to assess the technical adequacy of the various statistical procedures. The first two criteria listed below are central to consideration of bridging methods. The next six criteria apply both to bridging and long-term tabulation decisions. The last criterion is of primary importance for future tabulations of data collected using the 1997 standards. Bridging: Measure change over time. This is the most important criterion for bridging because the major purpose of any historical bridge will be to measure true change over time as distinct from methodologically induced change. The ideal bridging method, under this criterion, would be one that matches how the respondent would have responded under the 1977 standards had that been possible. In this ideal situation, differences between the new distribution and the old distribution would reflect true change in the distribution itself. Minimize disruptions to the single race distribution. This criterion applies only to methods for bridging. Its purpose is to consider how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the 1997 standards. To the extent that a bridging method can meet the other criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportion in the ongoing distribution, it will facilitate looking both forward and backward in time. Bridging and future tabulations: Range of applicability. Because the purpose of the guidelines is to foster consistency across agencies in tabulating racial and ethnic data, tabulation procedures that can be used in a wide range of programs and varied contexts are usually preferable to those that have more limited applicability. Meet confidentiality and reliability standards. It is essential that the tabulations maintain the confidentiality standards of the statistical organization while producing reliable estimates. Statistically defensible. Because tabulations may be published by statistical agencies and/or provided in public use data, the recommended tabulation procedures should follow recognized statistical practices. Ease of use. Because the tabulation procedures are likely to be used in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they can be implemented with a minimum of operational difficulty. Thus, the tabulation procedures must be capable of being easily replicated by others.  13   Skill required. Similarly, it is important that the tabulation procedures can be implemented by individuals with relatively little statistical knowledge. Understandability and communicability. Again, because the tabulation procedures will likely be used, as well as presented, in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they be easily explainable to the public. Future tabulations: Congruence with respondent's choice. Because of changes in the categories and the respondent instructions accompanying the question on race (allowing one or more categories to be selected), the underlying logic of the tabulation procedures must reflect to the greatest extent possible the full detail of race reporting.  CHAPTER 2 COLLECTING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY USING THE 1997 STANDARDS This chapter provides guidelines for use by agencies in developing data collection questions, formats, and associated procedures to implement the 1997 standards. A. Developing Procedures for Data Collection An interagency committee representing the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, and the General Accounting Office conducted two phases of cognitive research to develop and test procedures to collect and aggregate data on race and ethnicity using the 1997 standards. This chapter briefly describes the research conducted by the committee and offers initial guidelines for agencies developing data collection procedures. These guidelines will be continually reviewed and modified as implementation of the 1997 standards occurs, feedback from agencies is received, and new research findings become available. The guidelines in this chapter address the wording and format of questions that ask for self-reported data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin as well as the design of forms that collect aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin. Instructions and training procedures for field interviewers and administrative personnel who will be using these questions and forms are also discussed. 1. Developing and Testing Self-Reported Race and Ethnicity Questions A goal of this research was to provide guidance on the wording and format of questions for selfreported race and Hispanic or Latino origin, depending on the data collection mode. The interagency committee conducted research on survey questions administered by telephone or in  14   face-to-face personal interviews. In addition, the Census Bureau conducted extensive research on the design of questions in preparation for Census 2000. Both short and long versions of questions were tested. For short versions of the race question, the five minimum response categories were usedthey are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Long versions of the race question provided for reporting of subgroups such as Chinese, Japanese, Samoan, and so forth. For Hispanic or Latino origin questions, the minimum level of detail used was a Yes or No response indicating Hispanic or Latino origin background. Long versions of the question provided for reporting of subgroups such as Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Mexican. Below is a brief description of the methods used in the two phases of research conducted by the interagency committee followed by the results and their implications. This section concludes with general guidelines to use in collecting self-reported data on race and ethnicity and offers specific examples of question wording and format. Research Methods. In Phase I, 44 cognitive laboratory interviews were completed, 33 face-toface and 11 by telephone. Interviews were conducted in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Subjects were grouped for analysis purposes according to their reports of the race of their mother and father. Among the 44 subjects, 15 reported both parents as Black or African American, 10 reported both parents as White, 2 reported both parents as Asian, 2 reported both parents as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 2 reported both parents as American Indian or Alaska Native, 6 reported their mother's race as different from their father's race, and 7 reported some other response (e.g., Hispanic or country of origin). Of the 6 subjects who reported multiple race backgrounds, 3 reported American Indian or Alaska Native in combination with either Black or African American or White, 2 reported Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander in combination with either Asian or White, and 1 reported Asian and White. Ten of the 44 subjects were of Hispanic or Latino origin. In Phase II, a total of 82 cognitive interviews were conducted in four locations: New York, NY; Tulsa, OK; Sacramento, CA; and Honolulu, HI. Half of the interviews tested items designed for face-to-face surveys and the remaining half tested items designed for telephone administration. As in Phase I, subjects in Phase II were grouped for analysis purposes according to their reports of the race(s) of their mother and father. One of the purposes of the Phase II research was to test race and ethnicity questions specifically with subjects who were Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and of multiple race backgrounds. Among the 82 subjects, 17 subjects reported their parents as Hispanic; these subjects were not further categorized by race for analysis purposes. Sixteen reported both parents as Asian, 16 reported both parents as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 14 reported both parents as American Indian or Alaska Native, and19 reported their mother's race as different from their father's race. During the cognitive interviews, subjects were probed extensively about their racial and ethnic backgrounds. Based on this information, among the 19 subjects reporting more than one race, 5 were American Indian and White, 3 were Black and 15   White, 3 were American Indian or Alaska Native, Black, and White, 2 were Asian and White, 2 were American Indian or Alaska Native and Black, 2 were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and Asian, 1 was Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and White, and 1 was Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, and White. All research subjects were asked general demographic questions (e.g., age, education, and marital status) as well as the test versions of questions on Hispanic or Latino origin and race. Respondents were also asked to provide proxy data for all members of their household. Then, debriefings were conducted to learn more about the subjects' understanding of the questions and terms used. Findings. Generally, subjects were able to answer without difficulty the race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared. However, individual differences were found in the interpretation and meaning of terms used and there was obvious confusion among some subjects regarding the separation of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. In debriefings, some subjects who were of Hispanic or Latino origin said they usually report Hispanic (or some variation indicating Hispanic status or country of origin) when answering surveys or government forms that ask race. As expected, subjects who were interviewed face-to-face seemed to use and rely on the flashcards to select a response. Subjects interviewed by telephone had more difficulty answering the race question and the long version of the Hispanic question since they had to listen to a relatively long list of response options. There was some indication that hearing a list with alternative terms representing one category (i.e., Black or African American is one category, not two) may result in confusion. A few subjects thought the interviewer asked them to choose between Black or African American and commented that they did not like having to make a choice. This problem can be addressed through interviewer training that teaches the interviewer to pause longer after saying each response category; that is, if the interviewer is reading a list of ""...White, Black or African American, Asian, ..."" she/he should pause between the words White and Black, not pause between Black or African American, and pause again between African American and Asian. Last, there was some evidence that hearing the instruction to ""Select one or more..."" was misunderstood on the telephone to mean that the subject had to select more than one race. Interviewers will need to be trained to perceive and correct for this. Implications. As has been noted elsewhere in the literature, respondents often do not make clear distinctions among the terms and concepts used in defining race, ethnicity, nationality, and ancestry. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared but individual differences in the interpretation and meaning of terms used were found, as was confusion regarding the distinction of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. The following statements from the cognitive interviews illustrate these findings.  16   C  It means ethnic background. Not the country. I think people tend to cross quickly between using the terms race and country. When I say, ""Yes, I am Hawaiian,"" I mean that in my bloodstream I have Hawaii. My blood inheritance. Race I guess means the color somebody is. Or, their cultural heritage. The word race means the biological heritage from which you descend. Race means the culture that someone is from. The way I think of race, I think of it as a negative, probably because of what we've read about in the 60's--race riots, etc. It always seems to have a negative connotation. I prefer to use ethnicity. I answer differently sometimes, depending on what's beneficial to my family or me. Sometimes you see Hispanic as a choice for race. If Hispanic had been offered as a race then I would have chosen that. The race question is difficult because it doesn't have enough categories, it's too restrictive. With only five categories, there are two that are too specific--American Indian and Native Hawaiian--and there's a list of countries for the Asians. It doesn't specify anything about Central or South American descent. Everybody comes from different backgrounds; even White Americans can probably check off Irish, etc.  C C C C  C C C  General Guidelines. Based on work accomplished by the interagency committee as well as the testing of questions in a variety of modes and with subjects of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, the following guidelines and examples for the design of questions on race and ethnicity are offered: C Communicate clearly an instruction that allows, but does not require, multiple responses to the race question. The 1997 standards are clear that the format and wording used in a question on race must communicate to the respondent an instruction that multiple responses are acceptable. Based on research findings, the recommended forms for this instruction are Select one or more, Mark one or more, or Choose one or more. There was some limited research indicating that the wording ""...one or more..."" was better understood than a ""Mark all that apply"" alternative. Other instructions may be needed, especially when integrating a race question within an existing data collection instrument. For example, some mail instruments do not word questions in a personal way; that is, rather than What is your age? an instrument may simply have Age with a line for an entry. Taking this case further, if a form has an item simply worded as Race with a line for an entry, then an instruction should be included to 17   communicate that multiple race responses are acceptable (e.g., Race - enter one or more). Regardless of exact wording, the instruction must be evident to the respondent. C Consider using an instruction to answer both the question on Hispanic or Latino origin question and the question on race. Using an instruction has particular relevance for mail surveys or questionnaires that are selfadministered since there is no opportunity for interviewer interaction. An instruction such as the following that was used in Census 2000 may improve potential item non-response, especially among Hispanic respondents: NOTE: Please answer BOTH Questions 4 and 5 (Hispanic or Latino and Race). C For data collection efforts requiring detailed Hispanic or Latino origin or detailed race information, consider a two-part question or follow-up questions asked by the interviewer or printed on a form. For example, respondents who first report being of Hispanic or Latino origin would then be asked if they are Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and so forth. Take mode of administration carefully into account when designing questions and instructions. This guideline may seem obvious but it is often the case that surveys are conducted using more than one mode (i.e., the initial interview attempt may be a personal visit but a telephone interview is permissible). Since the questions should be designed with the mode in mind, there may need to be different versions of questions, depending on the mode of administration. C Provide definitions to the minimum race categories when possible. This guideline is particularly relevant when the short version (only the five minimum categories) of a question on race is used. Individual interpretation of the five categories could lead to response error, especially for respondents unsure of the definitions of Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander. For self-administered forms, providing the definition of the category should be considered if space and formatting limitations can be overcome. For interviewer-administered questions, the definitions should be readily available to the interviewer (usually in a manual that provides question-byquestion specifications or a pop-up screen if the interview is computer-assisted) to assist the respondent if needed.  C  18   C  Adhere to the specific terminology for the racial and ethnic categories as stated in the 1997 standards. The 1997 standards address the words and terms to use, and also indicate other terms that can be considered. For example, the title of the previous Black category should be revised to Black or African American and additional terms such as Haitian or Negro can be used if desired. In another example, American Indian should be used and Native American should not be substituted for American Indian. Reviewing the terms specified in the revised standards is strongly encouraged before designing questions on race and Hispanic or Latino origin.  Specific Guidelines on Question Wording and Format. The examples below are based on numerous discussions with interagency committee members, recommendations by questionnaire design experts, and testing results from both the interagency committee's research as well as research conducted by the Census Bureau in preparation for Census 2000. It is important to remember that other variations of questions on ethnicity and race may work just as well or better in a particular survey or data collection environment. There is not ""one right way"" to ask an individual to report his/her race and ethnicity. Rather, question wording and format should depend on the mode of administration as well as the context in which the questions are being asked. For ease of reference, the following list first provides examples for use in a face-to-face or personal visit mode of data collection, followed by telephone and then self-administration (usually thought of as a mail survey, but also could be used for forms and applications filled out by an individual). There are examples of questions that ask Hispanic or Latino origin as well as questions that ask for reports of race. It is important to recognize that as agencies implement the 1997 revised standards, more will be learned about which question formats work best. Thus, OMB does not at this time recommend one example of question wording or format over another. Also, OMB does not recommend a particular order of categories. There are advantages and disadvantages to various approaches such as an alphabetic ordering versus the ordering of the most prevalent group followed by groups less prevalent. The ordering shown reflects the ordering used in the testing of these questions. Examples of Questions on Hispanic or Latino Origin and Race Face-to-face administration (assumes flashcards are used in the interview situation) Example 1 Example 2 Example 3 Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino?

Developing and Testing Aggregate Reporting Forms Implementing the 1997 standards will cause fundamental changes to the ways in which data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin have previously been aggregated and reported. As a result, a second goal of the interagency committee's research is to provide guidance on the design of reporting forms that will be used by administrative personnel to aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin for a given population (e.g., reporting race and ethnicity for a school population). Initial research efforts. Three different types of forms were tested with eighteen subjects who were familiar with reporting aggregate data for a given population, but not necessarily familiar with the 1997 standards. Of the 18 respondents interviewed, 6 worked for the Federal Government, 8 worked in private industry, 3 worked in local correctional facilities, and 1 worked in a school. None of the forms tested were completed accurately without interviewer intervention. Regardless of the form tested or whether the testing was conducted in a laboratory or on-site, the most common problem was the requirement to count and report race for individuals who are of Hispanic or Latino origin. As an illustration, one subject stated ""It's (the form) basically asking how Hispanics were separated into groups of races. I think the part that confuses me is that our Hispanics do not view themselves as another race. And so that is kind of what threw me off... it's asking for Hispanics who had marked `White,' but they don't. They would have checked Hispanic."" Discussions with subjects revealed that all but one worked for agencies that have used a single question -- a combined race and ethnicity format -- to collect data. Rather than continuing the testing of different draft forms, work shifted in FY 2000 to establishing guidance for Federal enforcement agencies that collect, use, and/or report aggregate data on race. This work culminated in the March 9, 2000, issuance of OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, Guidance on Aggregation and Allocation of Data on Race for Use in Civil Rights Monitoring 24   and Enforcement (see Chapter 4 for further discussion on the implementation of this bulletin). The aggregation method described in the bulletin keeps intact the five single race categories and includes the four double race combinations most frequently reported in recent studies. The method also provides for the collection of information on any multiple race combinations that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest. A balance category is provided to aggregate and report those individual responses that are not included in (1) one of the five single race categories or four double race combinations or (2) other combinations that represent more than one percent of the population in a jurisdiction. Appendix B contains the bulletin and an example agencies could use to design aggregate reporting forms. Guidelines. Even though there were many problems found in developing and testing aggregate forms, the following initial guidelines can be offered:  If possible (notwithstanding confidentiality and disclosure issues), allow for the reporting of every combination of multiple race responses. If every combination cannot be reported because of burden and/or confidentiality concerns, include at a minimum the following 10 categories described in Bulletin 0002.            American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of individuals reporting more than one race    If the categories described in Bulletin 00-02 are used, also include to the greatest extent possible any aggregate counts of multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population of interest or study. Provide definitions that assist in understanding the concepts of single race responses and multiple race responses as well as the distinction between ethnicity and race. Explain how the missing data should be reported. Design the form in a professional manner and include clear instructions.      25     When feasible, consider providing information to respondents about how multiple race responses will be aggregated and reported to a Federal enforcement agency. For example, employers may want to include on employment applications the following information: Below are two questions--the first is about your ethnicity and the second your race. You are to answer both questions. In answering the second question, you may select one or more races. The summarized information is reported to the Federal Government for civil rights enforcement purposes. The summarized information will be reported in the following categories only: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. White Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Black or African American and White Asian and White American Indian or Alaska Native and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of all other individuals selecting more than one race.  If you select races that are not in categories 1 through 9 above, you will be counted in 10, which is the balance of all other individuals selecting more than one race. For example, if you select Asian and Black and White, your race will be reported in the balance category.  3. Developing Field Instructions and Training Procedures Work to develop interviewer instructions and interviewer training procedures has only recently begun. Long-term plans include developing and testing different training modules and interviewer instructions, depending on the mode of administration and the type of data collection. This work will, in all likelihood, address in a more systematic way some longstanding issues in the fielding of questions on race and ethnicity and ways that interviewers can be trained to improve data quality. Specific procedures on how to ask the questions and, in some cases, how to instruct the respondent to use the flashcard, will be developed along with suggested interviewer probes, definitions, and statements that can be used to address respondent problems. During the cognitive testing of the race and ethnicity questions, interviewer training and field procedures were also tested. Specifically, interviewers were trained to administer the questions in a standardized manner as would be done in actual survey interviews. (Cognitive probing was conducted after the questions were administered.) As is common in actual surveys, the interviewers were also supplied with a ""Question and Answer"" sheet to assist in responding to questions and confusion on the part of respondents.  26   The interviewers experienced the greatest difficulty in assisting Hispanic or Latino respondents who were having trouble answering the question on race. If a respondent answered ""I'm Hispanic or Latino"" (or some other term for Hispanic), the interviewers were trained to point the respondent back to the race categories by responding with something like ""In addition to being Hispanic, can you describe yourself as [repeat race categories]?"" Also, if a respondent insisted that Hispanic or Latino was a race or asked why it wasn't on the list of races, the interviewer was trained to say that ""Hispanic or Latino is generally considered an ethnicity rather than a raceHispanic or Latino persons can be of any race."" This study found these kinds of interviewer explanations to be mostly ineffective and in fact, some respondents found them to be offensive. The research team concluded that interviewers should rely on standard probing techniques to encourage respondents to place their answer into an explicit response category, and to repeat the categories if necessary. Clearly, more research is needed in this area as the 1997 standards become more widely implemented. B. Processing Census 2000 Data Using the 1997 Standards This section provides an overview of the procedures the Census Bureau is following in editing responses to the Census 2000 race and Hispanic origin questions and imputing responses to these questions for people who did not provide them. A comparison of these procedures with those implemented in the 1990 census is shown at the end of this section. The process can be divided into five parts: pre-editing procedures, within-household imputation, ""hot deck"" imputation, substitution, and group quarters editing. The basic philosophy in performing editing and imputation operations is that the Census Bureau has enough subjectmatter expertise and access to related information provided by the respondent, by others in the respondent's household, or by other people similar to the respondent to make reasonable imputations of missing responses. In cases where answers are not responsive to the question, they are removed and new responses are imputed. As part of its effort to inform the public about data quality, the Census Bureau publishes the degree to which it imputes responses for each question. In addition, the Census Bureau indicates in its microdata files which responses for a given record have been imputed. A certain amount of editing of responses occurs during coding operations, which precede the implementation of formal editing and imputation procedures. For example, during the coding of write-in responses to the question on race, coders must determine how national origin or ethnic group responses, such as Jamaican and German, should be coded into racial categories. The Census Bureau developed an approach for assigning race codes to responses that represent national origins or ethnic groups (excluding American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, Asian  27   subgroups, and Pacific Islander groups) and the results of this approach are reflected in the race code list and in the coding procedures.1 1. Pre-editing Procedures Purpose: To convert input codes into standard three-digit output codes, detect and correct outof-range values, ensure that no more than eight2 race codes appear on the edited file, and resolve into one code multiple responses given to the question on Hispanic origin. (Please note that all original responses are preserved on the unedited files.) Tasks: Race  The pre-editing procedures include the following operations to assign three-digit codes for responses to this question:     Convert check box marks into corresponding three-digit codes; Ensure that write-in codes obtained from the coding operations are valid;3 Eliminate duplicate codes; and Remove general codes when more specific codes are provided (for example, if the check box code for American Indian and Alaska Native and a code for a tribe are present, the check box code is eliminated).  Data on single ancestry by race from the 1990 census were used to help make decisions about how to code these responses into racial categories. Essentially, if 90 percent or more of people who reported a single, specific ancestry reported in a specific race category in 1990 (for example, 97 percent of people indicating Jamaican ancestry reported as Black in the question on race), then that race is used as the Census 2000 response. This 90percent rule was not applied to write-in responses of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, Asian groups, or Pacific Islander groups because the question on race was designed explicitly to obtain these types of responses. Although it is possible for more than eight race codes to be input during data processing (including coding), no more than eight race codes are kept on the edited files that are used for data products. For example, people may provide multiple ethnic responses (such as German, Italian, Jamaican, and Nigerian) in addition to multiple check box responses and write-in responses of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes or Asian and Pacific Islander groups, possibly resulting in eight or more input race codes. Results from the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal show that of people reporting more than one race, the overwhelming majority report only two races. Thus, storing up to eight race codes in the output files preserves, as much as possible, the original groups reported. In rare cases, invalid codes may have been applied inadvertently to a particular write-in response. Although extensive efforts are made to identify and correct these situations, the editing procedures act as a backup system for resolving any remaining problems. 3 2  1  28   The pre-editing procedures then ensure that no more to the edited file. The goal in this process is to retain American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and about groups while, at the same time, preserving reporting White, Black, and Some other race. Hispanic origin  than eight race codes are sent as output as much information as possible about detailed Asian and Pacific Islander of all other major racial groups such as  Pre-editing procedures for the Hispanic origin question are considerably simpler because there is only one write-in space and respondents are not asked to report multiple origins. The philosophy of the procedures, however, is similar to that for the race question. Some specific examples include:    Convert check box marks into corresponding three-digit codes; Ensure that write-in codes are valid; Override the general code for the ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino"" check box with the specific code for any origin that is written in. For example, the code for a write-in response of ""Guatemalan"" (code 222) replaces the check box code for ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/ Latino"" (code 280); and Reduce multiple check boxes marked for a respondent to one output code.4    For research purposes, all responses, including reporting of multiple responses, are retained . 2. Within-Household Imputation Purpose: When race or Hispanic origin data are missing, to impute responses for people from others within the same household who have reported race or Hispanic origin. Tasks: This part of the editing procedures is performed jointly for the race and Hispanic origin questions. They involve the following steps:  Identify people in the household for whom no response was given to either or both the Hispanic origin question and the race question;  If more than one response was given, obtaining a single response will be achieved as follows: (1) If all the responses are Hispanic, the respondent will be assigned as ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."" (2) If all the responses are not Hispanic, the respondent will be assigned as ""Not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."" (3) If the responses are a mix of Hispanic and non-Hispanic responses, the responses will be blanked and a single origin will be imputed either, first, from within the household or, if no one in the household gave a single response, from other neighboring households with members of the same race.  4  29      Search to see if an Hispanic origin response can be obtained from a write-in response to the question on race; and Search to see if a race response can be obtained from a write-in response to the question on Hispanic origin  After these preliminary steps, the within-household editing procedures follow one of three paths using a predetermined sequence of household relationship to assign race and origin depending on whether both race and origin are blank, only race is blank, or only origin is blank.5 If both race and origin are blank, the race and origin values assigned will come from the first person in that predetermined sequence with a value for race and/or origin. If only one value is obtained, the procedures for imputing only race (or only origin) are followed. If only race is blank, the race value is assigned from the first person in that predetermined sequence with the same reported origin group. If only Hispanic origin is blank, the origin value is assigned from the first person in that sequence with the same reported race group. If race and/or origin cannot be assigned from anyone within the household, then a response is assigned from a ""hot deck."" (See the next section.) 3. ""Hot Deck"" Imputation Purpose: When race and Hispanic origin data are missing from all household records, an origin or race will be assigned from other Census records in surrounding blocks (or nearby households) with ""similar"" characteristics. A hot deck is a data table (or ""matrix"") in which values of reported responses (donors), stratified by selected characteristics of the respondents, are stored and updated on a flow basis and used as needed to assign values of the variable in question to people with similar characteristics who do not have a response. In the case of race, the assignment from the ""donor"" can be a single or multiple race. Each cell in this table is a ""stack"" of sixteen stored values that are constantly updated as each household is processed, with the most recently reported value being the first one available for use. Thus, if race cannot be assigned for an individual from within the household, a race is assigned from the first available value in the hot deck ""stack"" based on age and origin. This value will come from a ""donor"" with similar age and origin who will have a high likelihood of living nearby, perhaps even next door. Sixteen values are stored in each cell to guard against having to assign the same stored value over and over again if several people in a row with the same characteristics require a hot deck allocation.  For example, if only race is needed to be imputed for the child of the householder, the editing procedures would look in the household for the person with a race reported and with the same origin as the child. Records would be searched in the following priority sequence: householder, another child, and spouse of householder.  5  30   Tasks: In the race/Hispanic origin editing procedures, there are seven hot deck allocation matrices. Three of them are concerned with allocating both a race and an origin. All three matrices are stratified by three broad age groups (15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older) and focus solely on assigning race and origin to the householder. Use of these matrices occurs when no one in the household has either a reported race or a reported origin. The race and origin assigned to the householder will also be assigned to all other members of the household. Each matrix has a different universe of ""donors."" The universe for the first matrix will be donors with Spanish surnames (that is, only householders with Spanish surnames are used to update this matrix). The universe for the second matrix will be donors with non-Spanish surnames. The universe for the third matrix will be donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish, or who have not provided a surname on the census form. The remaining four hot deck matrices assign either race or origin. They are all stratified by four broad age groups (0-14, 15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older). The one matrix that assigns race alone is further stratified by seven origin groups (Not Hispanic and six Hispanic groups: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central American/Dominican, Latin/South American, and Other Hispanic). The three remaining matrices that assign origin alone are stratified by six race groups (White, Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and Some other race). The universes for the three origin hot deck matrices are, respectively: donors with a Spanish surname, donors with a non-Spanish surname, and donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. 4. Substitution Purpose: To assign characteristics for members of occupied housing units for which there is nothing but a count of people and there are no characteristics reported for anyone in the housing unit. Tasks: For housing units that are not vacant but for which there are no data, the Census Bureau uses a hot deck technique called ""substitution"" to assign characteristics (including race and origin) to the people in the housing unit. The assignment of characteristics is achieved through the use of a substitution hot deck matrix which contains ""cells"" of characteristics for reported households and is stratified according to the type of enumeration method used (mail out/mail back or enumerator) and the number of people in the household. These cells are updated using the characteristics of the most recently reported household of the specified enumeration method and size. As with the other hot deck matrices, each cell stores information for eight households and these cells are constantly being refreshed as new households enter the editing program and are eligible to update the matrix.  31   5. Group Quarters Editing Purpose: To assign characteristics to people in group quarters. Tasks: A separate editing procedure is used for the group quarters population. This editing procedure is necessarily different from the household editing procedure because, in general, people in group quarters are not related to each other and assigning values for members of households depends in some way on household relationships. For people who do not report an origin, the group quarters editing procedure first searches to see if an Hispanic origin can be obtained from a write-in response to the race question. If not, a group quarters hot deck matrix is used. Each hot deck matrix for assigning origin is stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and by race, using the same six race categories as those used in the household hot decks. There are three hot deck matrices for origin: (a) one with donors having a Spanish surname, (b) one with donors having a non-Spanish surname, and (c) one with donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. If race is not reported, it will be assigned from the race group quarters hot deck matrix. The hot deck matrix is stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and by origin (non-Hispanic and six Hispanic groups). The seven origin groups are the same as those used in the household hot decks. If both origin and race are missing, they are assigned jointly from one of three race/origin group quarters hot decks: (a) one with donors having a Spanish surname, (b) one with donors having a non-Spanish surname, or (c) one with donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. These matrices are similar to the joint race/origin hot deck matrices used in the household editing and they are stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and age (0-14, 15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older).  32   Differences Between Census 2000 and 1990 Procedures for Editing Responses to the Questions on Race and Hispanic Origin Census 2000 RACE Reporting more than one race Reporting more than one race allowed Maximum of eight race codes retained.

Evaluating Census 2000 Data on Race For many census data users, both governmental and non-governmental and the private sector, there is a need to understand how the Census 2000 race distributions relate to race distributions from previous censuses and current surveys. Adoption of the 1997 standards resulted in a number of changes in the number and names of racial categories and in the sequencing of questions on ethnicity and race. For the 1990 census there were four racial categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander), whereas for Census 2000 there were five racial categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). In the 1990 census, the question on race preceded the question on Hispanic origin with two intervening questions. For Census 2000, the question on Hispanic origin was immediately before the question on race with a note to respondents to answer both questions. The most profound change to the standards, however, was that of allowing respondents to report more than one race if they chose to do so. Data by race from most Federal surveys currently reflect a collection methodology of asking respondents to mark only one racial category. Users of the Census 2000 data on race will need to compare the race distribution from Census 2000 to these other sources. To provide data users with a mechanism to make meaningful comparisons of data collected under the 1977 standards with data that are collected under the 1997 standards, the Census Bureau is undertaking two research projects. The first study was part of the Census 2000 data collection efforts. In Census 2000, an experimental panel of 10,000 housing units replicated the 1990 questions on race and Hispanic origin in the 1990 sequence and used the Census 2000 short form as a control panel. Data from the experimental and control panels will be used to evaluate the combined effects of the changes in question wording, format, content, and design on the quality and content of the data on race. The second study is currently being planned and is expected to be fielded in summer 2001. In this study, data from Census 2000 will be used to identify households where two or more races were reported for at least one respondent, using both short- and-long form households; differential sampling will be used to ensure that households receiving the long form are over sampled. Stratification and differential allocation of the sample to the strata will be explored to increase the precision of the estimates. Stratification will be based on Census 2000 data on such variables as age, Hispanic origin, race, tenure, and urban and rural geographic concentration. Other pertinent information obtained from an analysis of Census 2000 data on race and from external experts will also be considered in the sample design phase. A split panel design will be used; half of the sample households will be mailed a questionnaire that asks respondents to report a single race, while the other half will be asked to report one or more races. Much like in Census 2000, non-response follow up will be conducted for households that fail to return the questionnaire. To the extent possible, households that have moved since completing the Census 2000 questionnaires will be traced. Results from the respondents will be matched to their Census 2000 responses. Additionally, a follow-up interview will be conducted to ascertain 34   relevant information to help understand the reporting behavior of respondents who reported two or more races and are now being asked to report a single race or vice versa. Background information on single race respondents will also be obtained. It is expected that reliable estimates that replicate Census 2000 will be produced for the single race distribution and for the five most frequent combinations of two or more races (White and Black; White and American Indian and Alaska Native; White and Asian; Black and American Indian and Alaska Native; and Black and Asian) at the national level. Synthetic modeling is expected to produce reliable estimates at the state and lower geographic levels. Like the Census Bureau, other Federal agencies also have plans to evaluate data on race collected using the 1997 standards. Future updates of this guidance will include descriptions of these research projects and, if available, will summarize the research results.  35   CHAPTER 3 TABULATING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY COLLECTED USING THE 1997 STANDARDS This chapter describes plans for tabulating data on race and ethnicity collected under the 1997 standards to meet various Federal needs for these data. A. Census 2000 Data The Census 2000 questionnaire provided individuals the opportunity to self-report their racial identity by selecting one or more races. For purposes of Census 2000, in an effort to encourage response to this question and to provide the opportunity to gather data on extremely small groups, OMB approved the use of a sixth category -- Some Other Race -- in addition to the minimum set of five racial categories. This discussion covers tabulation plans for the six categories of race and the two categories of ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino) and for possible combinations of these racial and ethnic categories. It does not address tabulation plans that are being developed for detailed groups of American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic populations for which information was collected in Census 2000. 1. Protection of Data Confidentiality To maintain confidentiality as required by law (Title 13, United States Code), the Census Bureau uses a confidentiality edit to ensure that published data do not disclose information about specific individuals or households. The result is that a small amount of uncertainty is introduced into census data for small geographic areas to prevent identification of specific individuals or households. As with data from the 1990 census, a confidentiality edit will be implemented for data from Census 2000 by selecting a sample of census households from internal census files and interchanging their data with data from other households that have identical numbers of household members, but that are in different locations. The net result of this procedure is that the data user's ability to obtain census data is increased, particularly for small geographic areas and small population groups. 2. Plans for Tabulations by Race and Ethnicity The plans reflect OMB's preliminary guidelines (See Chapter 1, Section B) on tabulations by race and ethnicity. This discussion of the plans covers the presentation of data on both population totals for racial and ethnic categories and on population characteristics (e.g., age, sex,  36   educational attainment, labor force status, occupation, and income) for racial and ethnic categories. Before describing these plans for tabulations by race and ethnicity, it is helpful to describe the maximum number of racial and/or ethnic categories for which data could be provided. There are 63 potential single and multiple race categories -- 6 categories for those who marked exactly one race and 57 categories for those who marked two or more races. These 57 categories of two or more races include the 15 possible combinations of two races (for example, Asian and White), the 20 possible combinations of three races, the 15 possible combinations of four races, the 6 possible combinations of five races, and the 1 possible combination of all six races. There are two ethnic categories (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Thus there are 126 categories (63 x 2) in which the population could be classified by both race and ethnicity. The 63 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories of race may be collapsed down to 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories by combining the 57 categories of two or more races. These 7 categories are: White alone, Black or African American alone, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Asian alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, Some other race alone, and Two or more races. Alternative groupings for tabulations by race reflect OMB's preliminary guidelines to show ""the total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination."" In combination literally means ""in combination with one or more other races."" In this ""all-inclusive"" approach, tabulations will be shown for each of six categories, which will overlap and will add to more than the total population to the extent that individuals report more than one race. These six categories are: White alone or in combination, Black or African American alone or in combination, American Indian and Alaska Native alone or in combination, Asian alone or in combination, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone or in combination, and Some other race alone or in combination. As in the case of the 63 racial categories, both tabulations by race of the 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories and tabulations by race alone or in combination could be classified by ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Because of concerns about the usefulness and reliability of data on population characteristics for small populations, about issues with respect to confidentiality, and about providing data products so voluminous that most data cell values would be zero, the Census Bureau is planning (as it has in previous censuses) to present more geographic detail by race and ethnicity for population totals than for population characteristics (e.g., age, sex, housing tenure, education, and income). (The term population characteristics is used here to include both population and housing characteristics. The characteristics of occupied housing units by race and ethnicity are classified  37   based on the race and ethnicity of the householder.) Specific plans concerning data on population totals and population characteristics by race and ethnicity are discussed later. 3. Overview of Plans for Data Products The Census Bureau plans to release a variety of data products from Census 2000 in three different media: Internet, CD-ROM, and paper. These data products will include 100-percent data (based on information collected on all questionnaires, such as age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin) and sample data (based on information collected only on long-form questionnaires, such as education, occupation, and income). Population totals by race and ethnicity are based on 100-percent data, whereas some population characteristics by race and ethnicity are based on 100-percent and some on sample data. The presentation of data by race and ethnicity planned for eight different aggregated data products and for microdata files is discussed below in detail. The eight aggregated data products are: (1) Census 2000 Redistricting Data Summary File (100-percent data) (2) Demographic Profile (100-percent and sample data on population characteristics for the total population, but no characteristics data by race or ethnicity) (3) Summary File 1 (100-percent data) (4) Summary File 2 (100-percent data) (5) Quick Tables (100-percent data and sample data) (6) Census 2000: Summary Population and Housing Characteristics (100-percent data) (7) Summary File 3 (sample data) (8) Summary File 4 (sample data) Plans for aggregated tabulations by race and ethnicity are discussed in the following two sections, first for 100-percent data on population totals and characteristics and then for sample data on population characteristics. Microdata files are discussed in the last section. 4. 100-Percent Data on Population Totals and Characteristics by Race and Ethnicity Census 2000 Redistricting Data Summary File (100-percent data). This file is referred to hereafter as the PL 94-171 file, by which name it is commonly known. Public Law 94-171 requires that the Census Bureau work closely with the ""officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting of each state"" to determine the specific tabulations needed from the decennial census. Tabulations planned for this file are based on meetings and communications with the Redistricting Task Force of the National Conference of State Legislatures and state-appointed liaisons of the governors and legislatures. During this process, senior officials from OMB, the Voting Rights Section of the Department of Justice, and the Census Bureau consulted with the Task Force and state legislative officials.  38   As described earlier, a confidentiality edit will be used in Census 2000, as was done in the 1990 census. Thus, as in 1990, there will be no data suppression, and there will be many data cells in the PL 94-171 file with very small values (e.g., zero, one, or two). The PL 94-171 file will include population totals down to the block level for the 63 racial categories described earlier, along with subtotals for the population of one race, for two or more races, and for each combination of two races, three races, four races, five races, and six races. The PL 94-171 file will include four matrices (one-dimensional statistical tables). The first matrix will show the racial categories just described. The second matrix will show the total Hispanic or Latino population and the racial categories for the population that is Not Hispanic or Latino. The racial and ethnic categories included in these two matrices are shown in Table 1. The third and fourth matrices will repeat the first and second matrices, but limited to the population 18 years and older. From the data that will be presented on the PL 94-171 File, it will be possible to derive population totals for a race alone or in combination (by addition) and for the Hispanic or Latino population by race (by subtraction). The PL 94-171 file will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Demographic Profile (100-percent data). For geographic areas down to the census tract level, the Demographic Profile is designed to provide an overview of 100-percent census data that includes all population and housing topics for which data were collected on a 100-percent basis: sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household relationship, and housing occupancy and tenure. Given the limited amount of space to show data on each topic, population totals by race and ethnicity will be limited, and data on population characteristics will be limited to the total population. Population totals will be shown for each of the six races alone, for two or more races, and for each major race alone or in combination (as described earlier), but will not be shown for the 57 specific categories of two or more races. The population total will be shown also for the Hispanic or Latino population. The Demographic Profile will be available on the Internet and CD-ROM and will be available also on paper for governmental units (including states, counties, incorporated places, American Indian and Alaska Native Areas, and Hawaiian Home Lands). Summary File 1 (100-percent data). For population totals, data shown down to the block level on the PL 94-171 File (including all 63 racial categories) will be repeated on Summary File 1 (SF-1). Data on population characteristics will be shown on SF-1 for the total population and for nine racial or ethnic groups. In some cases characteristics will be shown down to the block level and in other cases down to the census tract level. The ten groups for which population characteristics will be shown are:  39   (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)  Total White alone Black or African American alone American Indian and Alaska Native alone Asian alone Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone Some other race alone Two or more races Hispanic or Latino (of any race) White alone, not Hispanic or Latino  SF-1 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Summary File 2 (100-percent data). Summary File 2 (SF-2) will show data on population characteristics, subject to a population threshold, down to the census tract level for a large number of groups. As shown in Table 2, these groups include the 63 racial categories, two or more races, the six races alone or in combination, Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino for race alone and for race alone or in combination. The population threshold for SF-2 is 100. If the population of a racial or ethnic group is less than 100 in a geographic area (e.g., a county or a census tract), population characteristics for that group for that geographic area will not be included on SF-2. (Even if population characteristics for a specific group in a specific geographic area are not available on SF-2, the population total will be available on SF-1.) SF-2 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Quick Tables (100-percent data). Quick Tables (referred to as Table Shells in the Draft Provisional Guidance of 2/17/99) represent a new data product for Census 2000. Each Quick Table is designed to print on one page (from the Internet) and has a fixed table boxhead and table stub (e.g., showing population by age and sex). The Quick Tables, which correspond generally to tables in detailed printed report series from the 1990 census, are supported by the summary files (just as summary tape files supported detailed printed report series in 1990). Quick tables show less data than are available in summary files, but in a more user-friendly format, including more derived measures such as percent distributions. Quick Tables will be available down to the census tract level and will show extensive 100-percent data by race and ethnicity, subject to a population threshold of 100, including population characteristics for racial and ethnic groups included in SF-1 and SF-2. Quick tables will be available on the Internet. Census 2000 Summary Population and Housing Characteristics (100-percent data). This is a printed report series (one report per state and a national summary report) that is designed to provide an overview of 100-percent data in a format that facilitates comparison across geographic areas (e.g., all counties in a state). As with the Demographic Profile, some 40   population totals will be presented by race and ethnicity, as shown in Table 3, but data on population characteristics will be limited to the total population with the following two exceptions. Data on population characteristics will be shown for the American Indian and Alaska Native population in American Indian and Alaska Native Areas and for the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander population in Hawaiian Home Lands. This printed report series, which corresponds closely to the 1990 census printed report series on Summary Population and Housing Characteristics, will show data in state reports for counties, county subdivisions, and places (both incorporated and unincorporated). Census 2000 Summary Population and Housing Characteristics will be a printed report series. 5. Sample Data on Population Characteristics by Race and Ethnicity Summary File 3 (sample data). Sample data (based on information collected only on longform questionnaires, such as education, occupation, and income) on population characteristics down to the block group level will be provided on Summary File 3 (SF-3). These data will be shown for the total population and for the same nine racial and ethnic groups for which data on 100-percent population characteristics will be shown on SF-1. The data on SF-3 will be shown subject to a population threshold (see earlier discussion of SF-2); however, this threshold has not yet been determined. SF-3 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Summary File 4 (sample data). Sample data on population characteristics down to the census tract level will be provided on Summary File 4 (SF-4). These data will be shown for the same list of racial and ethnic groups for which data on 100-percent population characteristics will be shown on SF-2. The data on SF-4 will be shown subject to a population threshold (see earlier discussion of SF-2); however, this threshold has not yet been determined. SF-4 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Quick Tables (sample data). The earlier description of Quick Tables in conjunction with 100percent data applies also to sample data. Quick Tables will be available down to the census tract level and will show extensive sample data by race and ethnicity, including population characteristics for racial and ethnic groups included in SF-3 and SF-4. The population threshold for sample Quick Tables will depend on the threshold selected for SF-3 and SF-4. Quick Tables will be available on the Internet. 6. Microdata Files Tabulations on population characteristics by race and ethnicity described above are limited to what is planned for aggregated data products. In addition, the Census Bureau will produce 41   public-use microdata sample (PUMS) files, as was done in 1990, which will include data by race and ethnicity. Plans for PUMs files from Census 2000, including the amount of racial and ethnic detail, are currently being developed. In 1990, in addition to the confidentiality edit described earlier, the PUMS files were stripped of names and addresses, the order of records was rearranged on the file, and a minimum population threshold of 100,000 was used. In addition, and subject to the Census Bureau's strict confidentiality standards, the Census Bureau plans to make available on the Internet through the American FactFinder, an Advanced Query Function that permits data users to create tabulations to their own specifications based on microdata files. These microdata files, which underlie the 100-percent and sample summary files, are the 100-percent edited detail file (HEDF) and the sample edited detail file (SEDF). If a data user wants data on population characteristics for a racial or ethnic group for which characteristics are not available in summary files or Quick Tables and for a geographic area for which a PUMS file is not available, it will be possible -- again, subject to strict confidentiality standards set by the Census Bureau -- to obtain these data with a custom tabulation from the Census Bureau. Because of the strict confidentiality standards, the quantity of data that can be obtained will depend on several factors, including the geographic area, the size of the population universe, and the extent of the characteristics' detail.  42   Table 3.1.

Survey and Administrative Records Data This section applies to the presentation of data collected under the 1997 standards through surveys and administrative records. Although these proposed tabulation guidelines are applicable in the near term, they are designed to provide a framework that can be expanded in the future as it becomes possible to present more data on multiple race responses. The main guideline is that data should be presented in as much detail as possible (thereby satisfying the congruence with respondent's choice criterion), subject to agency criteria for statistical reliability and confidentiality (satisfying the meet confidentiality and reliability standards criterion), and thus the amount of detail presented will be a function of sample size and sample design. In addition, to the extent possible, Federal agencies should report data using the same set of standardized categories to facilitate comparisons across subjectmatter areas and data systems, thus satisfying the criteria relating to range of applicability, statistical defensibility, and understandability and communicability. The decision to revise the policy for the collection of data on race reflects the increasing complexity of our Nation's demographics. As a result, the ways that survey and administrative record data on race are tabulated and analyzed also will become more complex. The proposed guidelines in this section reflect this complexity. Every attempt was made to keep the tables as simple as possible in order to satisfy the criteria ease of use and skill required. Examples of tabulation strategies are provided and illustrated using data collected as part of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to report more than one race, but has also asked respondents to indicate the single race with which they most closely identified. The data on race from this survey have been retabulated for illustrative purposes to be as comparable as possible to the categories in the 1997 standards. (The tables in this section are based on data combined from three years of NHIS data. The resulting larger sample size improves the reliability of the estimates and enables more categories to be shown; however, even when combining three years of data on race, counts for some categories cannot be shown due to small sample sizes. In addition, in some tables, cell counts are divided by a constant to illustrate the situation faced by surveys with smaller sample sizes than the NHIS and/or where it is not possible or appropriate to combine more than one year of data.) As noted above, agencies are to provide as much detail as possible while adhering to their own standards for data quality and confidentiality. Under a typical data quality standard, a table cell cannot be published if its relative standard error (or other measure of dispersion) is larger than some value specified by the agency. Such a cell would be suppressed (withheld from publication). Under a confidentiality standard, a cell value must be suppressed if knowledge of the cell value might enable someone to gain knowledge about one of the respondents contributing data to the cell. If a cell is suppressed to preserve confidentiality, other cells must also be suppressed so the cell value cannot be derived by subtraction. This is called ""complementary suppression."" In either situation, information on subgroups that cannot appear 48   separately in the table would be included in appropriate subtotals and/or in the total. (The reader may wish to refer to Statistical Policy Working Paper 22: Report on Statistical Disclosure Limitation Methodology for more information concerning the definition of sensitive cells and the selection of cells for complementary suppression. The Statistical Policy Working Papers are available on the Internet at www.fedstats.gov -- go to Policy.) Since agencies do not use a common set of standards for evaluating confidentiality and quality issues, arbitrary cell size criteria were adopted in this report to illustrate how the application of agency quality and confidentiality standards might affect the cells that can be shown in tables. No data for cells of less than 150 are shown in any table. The tables that result give a preview of the distributions that are likely to result from the implementation of the 1997 standards. Note that since the only data being displayed in this report are population counts, it is possible to show more data cells using the 150 criterion than would be the case if the table presented attributes (income, education, health outcomes, etc.) of these groups. In addition, counts are provided for all ages and both sexes. If data are presented for one sex or one age group, as is most often the case, cell sizes would be much smaller and not as many cells could be reported. Individual survey systems will make decisions as to what data can be shown based on the characteristics of each system and the confidentiality and reliability guidelines established for that data system. It will not be possible to tabulate two types of responses into the categories identified in the standards. The first type of response is when no information on race is provided. In this report the heading ""Race Not Reported"" is used for this type of response. This response type can be further subdivided according to the reason that no information was obtained -- refusal, don't know, and not ascertained. The second type is when the response that was received does not match any of the standard racial categories. Such responses are tabulated in this report using the heading ""Other Race."" Given that sample size will determine what categories can be shown in a given table, a third heading, ""Not Tabulated Above,"" will be used to include either single or ""more than one race"" categories that are specified in the standard, but that are not large enough to be published separately. Unknowns are included in this category as well. These three special headings (""Race Not Reported,"" ""Other Race,"" and ""Not Tabulated Above"") are used in the tables in this section for illustrative purposes. Since these categories are generally of more interest for methodological rather than substantive analyses, most statistical publications will probably use simpler ways of accounting for these types of responses. Strategies for tabulating these kinds of responses will follow agency policy and the analytic objectives of the report. A remaining issue to be addressed by Federal agencies is the manner in which data are edited and imputed. The rules used to edit and impute respondents' data on race and ethnicity will affect the racial distributions derived from Federal surveys and administrative records. As noted elsewhere in this report, rules for editing and imputation of data on race and ethnicity should be an area of further research and collaboration for Federal agencies, to ensure that the data reported are as comparable as possible. 49   Since the objective of this section is to illustrate different tabulation strategies, categories with frequencies too small to be shown will not be treated the same way in all of the tables. In some tables, the category is not shown at all in the table stub but the cell value is included in the total and might be included under the heading ""Not Tabulated Above"" (as described above). In other tables, the category is retained in order to clarify the structure of the table but data are replaced by a ""W"" to illustrate that they have been withheld from publication for data quality/confidentiality considerations. When the data are replaced by ""W,"" a footnote is used to describe the reason the data are not shown. No guidance is suggested for handling categories too small to be shown in the table. Such decisions will follow agency guidelines and the objectives of the analyses. In all tables in this section, the ""More Than One Race"" heading includes respondents who selected more than one of the five basic racial categories in the 1997 standards. Following recommendations in the standards, many data collection systems obtain information on a more detailed set of responses. When surveys collect more detailed information on race than the minimum five racial categories, some persons may indicate that they identify with more than one of the more detailed groups. For example, within the Asian group, respondents might indicate that they are of Chinese and Japanese heritage. These respondents would not be included in the ""More Than One Race"" heading, but would be included in the total for Asians. In tables where specific Asian heritages are reported, and if sample sizes are sufficient, an additional Asian subcategory could be used to indicate the number of individuals who marked more than one of the detailed Asian categories. Table 3.4 provides a detailed set of categories for tabulating data on race that reflects the major dimensions of the 1997 standards. Table 3.4 displays the five single categories, includes more detail on the Asian subgroups, and displays a number of multiple-response categories. The specific multiple response categories that could be presented in other data collection systems would be a function of the overall sample size and the regional characteristics of the population where the sample is selected. The detailed subcategories that are presented should support recreating the minimum basic set of racial categories (American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN); Asian; Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI); and White). To illustrate the construction of a table based on a survey with a smaller sample size, all cell counts have been divided by 20. Table 3.5 shows a category for each of the five single racial groups in the 1997 standards as well as a ""More Than One Race"" heading; sample sizes do not permit the presentation of more detailed categories, including single race AIAN and NHOPI and specific multiple race categories. Data are not shown separately for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, the single race category with the smallest frequency, nor for any of the subcategories under ""More Than One Race."" The category ""Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders"" is retained in the table stub and a ""W"" in the cell indicates that the value is withheld due to sample size. Since the Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander category is the only single race category that cannot be shown, both the number and the percent for the Native 50   Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander group are readily obtained by subtraction. This would be appropriate only if the cell were being suppressed for data quality concerns (i.e., the value is unreliable). If it were being suppressed for confidentiality concerns, another cell would also have to be suppressed to prevent the cell value from being obtained by subtraction. As was the case under the 1977 standards, it will often not be possible to tabulate data using all of the categories used to collect the information. If data for one or more of the five minimum racial categories fail the requirements for data quality or confidentiality, standard agency products should include them in an aggregation such as ""Not Tabulated Above,"" or only in the totals rather than combining them with categories that are publishable alone. For example, if the data for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders cannot be published separately, these data should not be combined with data in the Asian category (except when such combinations are needed for comparability with data collected under the 1977 standards). Instead, the data on Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders should be included in the total and either omitted from the detailed tabulations completely, replaced with a symbol and footnoted, or included in a separate heading for all groups not specifically tabulated (i.e., under the ""Not Tabulated Above"" heading.) This last approach is illustrated in Table 3.6 from Table 3.4 where cell counts have been divided by 60. This table is designed to illustrate what might happen when sample sizes are increasingly smaller and data from even fewer categories can be reliably presented. The American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, ""More Than One Race,"" and ""Race Not Reported"" categories are not listed separately in Table 3.6, but were included both in the Total and the ""Not Tabulated Above"" rows. In order to display as much data as possible, as well as to reflect the complexity of reporting on race, some additional categories may be tabulated and reported along with the basic tabulations. These categories may not be mutually exclusive but would combine categories to create useful analytic distinctions. For example, a heading could be created for persons reporting that they are Asian whether as a single race or in combination with any other race(s). Parallel categories could be created for any of the five single racial categories. The resulting counts are called ""all inclusive."" They form distributions for each individual racial group; that is, the sum of the percent of respondents who mark a particular group alone, the percent who mark that group and at least one other group, and the percent who did not mark that group is 100 percent. The all inclusive distributions may provide information on population groups that might not have sufficient size in the sample to be included in basic tabulations. Table 3.7 provides a suggested tabulation strategy. The ""NHOPI in combination with other races"" category does not meet the criteria for inclusion (n=150) and, therefore, is not shown. If this cell suppression were intended to preserve confidentiality, another cell would have to suppressed as well. This is illustrated by suppressing the ""NHOPI all inclusive"" category. Note that when the tabulation involves counts or percentages, the analyst can subtract the count or percentage for each single race from the all inclusive count or percentage to obtain the count of individuals reporting each race in combination with any other race(s). For example, the ""Black or African American all inclusive count"" minus the ""Black or African American"" single 51   race count will yield a count for those reporting ""Black or African American in combination with one or more other races."" This would not be possible if the tabulation included summary statistics (mean, median, or percent) for attributes such as income, education, or health outcomes. Tables 3.4 - 3.7 describe tabulation alternatives for data on race collected using the 1997 standards. These standards also affect the collection and reporting of data on Hispanic or Latino origin. The 1997 standards call for asking a question on Hispanic or Latino origin followed by a question on race but also allows under limited circumstances for a single, combined question where Hispanic or Latino origin is included in a list along with the five standard racial categories. In such a combined question, respondents are also instructed to ""mark one or more."" In either approach, Hispanic origin may be reported alone or in combination with one or more races. As was the case for the tabulation of data on race, data on Hispanic or Latino ethnicity can also be presented for specific subgroups (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican) as shown in Table 3.8. The tabulation headings used will be a function of the overall sample size and the population composition where the sample is selected. Table 3.8 presents data only on Hispanic ethnicity and does not include information on race. Whether separate questions or a combined format is used to collect data on Hispanic or Latino origin and race, there are applications where a combined tabulation of the data on these two dimensions is preferred. Data collected under the 1997 standards using either format will support the analysis of data on both Hispanics or Latinos and non-Hispanics or non-Latinos by race (Table 3.9). For example, Table 3.9 shows that among Hispanics or Latinos, the sample size permits the presentation of data for Blacks, Whites, those of ""other"" races, and those selecting more than one race. Tabulations which incorporate the Hispanic or Latino subgroup information can be developed by expanding Table 3.9. Since respondents are free to select one or more categories in the combined format, data collected from a survey or administrative reporting system where a combined format is used can also be tabulated using Tables 3.8 or 3.9.  52   Table 3.4.

A. Civil Rights Enforcement and Monitoring OMB Bulletin No. 00-02. In response to requests from agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws, OMB led an interagency group that developed guidance on:   the collection of aggregate data on race when agencies request information from businesses, schools, and other entities and the allocation by agencies of multiple race responses, whether individual or aggregate, for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement.  This guidance (issued as OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, dated March 9, 2000 -- see Appendix B) ensures that agencies can continue to monitor compliance with laws that offer protections for those who historically have experienced discrimination and that reporting burdens are minimized for those reporting aggregate data on race to Federal agencies. The 1997 standards require, among other things, that agencies offer individuals the opportunity to select one or more races when reporting information on race in Federal data collections. Federal enforcement agencies often collect data on race from businesses, schools, and other entities in aggregate form. To meet these reporting requirements, these institutions will now be collecting single and multiple race responses from individuals and aggregating them for Federal reports. To simplify and minimize the reporting burden for institutions, an aggregation method has been developed that uses:    the five single race categories; four double race combinations most frequently reported in recent studies; any multiple race combinations based on Census 2000 data that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest in the relevant jurisdictions; and  60     a balance category to report those individual responses that are not included in (1) one of the five single race categories or four double race combinations or (2) other combinations that represent more than one percent of the population in a jurisdiction.  This method provides consistency across agencies for the reporting of aggregate data, but does not preclude the collection of more detailed information if the agency chooses to do so. The following example illustrates this aggregation method. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American > 1 percent: Fill in if applicable______________________ > 1 percent: Fill in if applicable______________________ Balance of individuals reporting more than one race Total  To provide consistency across agencies responsible for enforcing civil rights laws, guidance has been developed for how multiple race responses should be allocated. This allocation guidance does not use methods that require either fractional or double counting of individuals, or arbitrary allocation of responses to one minority group versus another. The following rules will be used to allocate multiple race responses for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement.   Responses in the five single race categories are not allocated. Responses that combine one minority race and white are allocated to the minority race.  61     Responses that include two or more minority races are allocated as follows:   If the enforcement action is in response to a complaint, allocate to the race that the complainant alleges the discrimination was based on. If the enforcement action requires assessing disparate impact or discriminatory patterns, analyze the patterns based on alternative allocations to each of the minority groups.  Allocation for enforcement purposes should not be confused with various allocation methods for ""bridging"" to past data collections as discussed in Chapter 5 of this report. The principal purpose of allocation for bridging purposes is to conduct trend or time series analysis. 1. Redistricting One of the first official statutory uses of data on race and ethnicity collected under the new standards will be for legislative redistricting following Census 2000. The new data format should not require substantial changes in the way redistricting will be conducted. a. Background Before a new redistricting plan can legally be implemented, states and political subdivisions that are covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act (which include all state and local jurisdictions in nine states and parts of seven others) are required to demonstrate to either the United States Attorney General or a Federal district court in the District of Columbia that their new redistricting plan has neither the purpose nor the effect of reducing the voting strength of their minority citizens. In addition, all states and political subdivisions are prohibited by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act from using redistricting plans that have the purpose or effect of discriminating against minority voters, including diluting their voting strength. The U.S. Department of Justice or private citizens may file lawsuits to enforce Section 2. In order to comply with these Federal laws, states and their political subdivisions typically use the Bureau of Census redistricting count tabulations issued pursuant to Public Law 94-171 to assess the racial and ethnic compositions and distributions of their residents as they draw their redistricting plans. The data are also central to the Department's analysis of whether or not a new redistricting plan reduces the voting strength of minority citizens in violation of Section 5 of the Act. The data are also used for evaluating and proving claims under Section 2 of the Act. For example, the data are used to determine where minority voters are concentrated, as well as to identify areas of racially polarized voting. After the redistricting process is complete, courts rely on the redistricting count data, together with other evidence, to decide any Section 2 legal challenge that may be filed challenging the redistricting plan.  62   b. How the 2000 Census Data Will Be Used for Redistricting in 2001 The 1990 census Public Law 94-171 tabulations reported data down to the block level for the total population and the voting age population (ages 18 years and older) for four racial groups (American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and White) and a residual category (""other"" race). Data on these racial groups were also cross-tabulated by Hispanic origin. Categories were mutually exclusive (each person was counted only once), and the categories added to the total population reported for a geographic region. In Census 2000, there are three major changes to the reporting of data on race and ethnicity: (1) the instruction to ""mark one or more"" racial categories; (2) the splitting of the ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" category into two separate categories -- ""Asian"" and ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;"" and (3) the combining of the 1990 categories for American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut into a single ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" category with a write-in space (as in 1990) for principal or enrolled tribe. Hispanic or Latino origin was ascertained in a separate question, as in the 1990 census. The Census 2000 PL 94-171 Redistricting Data will, for the first time, include tabulations of persons who marked two or more races (the multiple race tabulations). In tabulating the PL 94-171 data, the Bureau of the Census will produce 63 tabulation categories: 6 tabulation categories for the 5 ""single race"" groups plus ""some other race""; and 57 tabulation categories for possible combinations of these 6 groups. Such data will be reported in full detail down to the block level to provide the flexibility needed for the enforcement of civil rights programs, and particularly for analysis of redistricting plans under the Voting Rights Act. In accordance with Title 13, U.S. Code, the Census Bureau will continue to protect the confidentiality of individuals during the tabulation and presentation of the Voting Rights data at every step in the process and during the course of Census 2000. The inclusion of multiple race tabulations in the PL 94-171 redistricting data file has raised questions as to how such data will be analyzed by the Department of Justice pursuant to its responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act. This issue has been addressed in OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, issued on March 9, 2000 (see Appendix B). In its analysis of the Census redistricting data, the Department of Justice will be guided by the bulletin. After aggregating the data pursuant to Part I of the bulletin, multiple race responses will be allocated pursuant to Part II of the bulletin. Thus, any responses that indicate white and one minority race will be allocated to the minority race. Multiple race responses that include more than one minority race will be reviewed to determine if there are any patterns affecting any of the minority races reported. Current research indicates that the number of multiple race responses in the Census 2000 is expected to be small  2 percent or less. Therefore, the impact of multiple race responses on the analysis of Census data for purposes of the Department of Justice's responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act is likely to be minimal.

Equal Employment Opportunity This section describes the process for implementing the 1997 standards in data collections that are used for monitoring equal employment opportunities. One of the Federal Government's most significant uses of data on race and ethnicity is in its efforts to ensure that every individual has an equal opportunity for employment. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination in employment based upon race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or retaliation/reprisal. Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, similarly prohibits discrimination in employment by Federal Government contractors. Executive Order No. 11246 also requires contractors covered by its provisions to ensure affirmatively that they do not discriminate against their employees and applicants for employment. Responsibility for enforcement of Federal equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws and regulations is shared among the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the U.S. Department of Education. The Federal EEO agencies use data on race and ethnicity to ensure nondiscrimination in employment. In implementing the 1997 standards, the EEO agencies will consider the burden imposed on those required to collect and report racial and ethnic data to the Federal Government. The 1997 standards are not intended to diminish the availability and quality of information collected and made available for civil rights enforcement purposes. Following the 1990 census, the Census Bureau, under contract to EEO agencies, created an EEO Special File that has been generally used as a benchmark for employment availability determinations. It is anticipated that a similar file containing data collected under the 1997 standards will be created from the Census 2000 data. a. Employee and Applicant Reporting Requirements  Methods Used Prior to Implementing the 1997 Standards Data on each private employer's workforce are collected annually on the Employer Information Reports (EEO-1 Report). Biennial surveys are collected from local referral unions (EEO-3), state and local governments (EEO-4), elementary and secondary public schools (EEO-5), and post-secondary schools using the Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS Fall Staff Survey, formerly EEO-6). Currently, these forms collect information about each employer's workforce by job category, gender, and race/ethnicity using the categories in the 1977 standards.  64   Under the 1977 standards, employers were only required to collect, maintain, and report single race information on employees, using the following five categories: (1) White, not of Hispanic origin; (2) Black, not of Hispanic origin; (3) Hispanic; (4) Asian or Pacific Islander; and (5) American Indian or Alaskan Native. Instructions on the current EEO forms state that the race/ethnicity of an employer's workforce may be obtained either by ""visual surveys of the workforce, or from post-employment records."" The current instructions explicitly state that eliciting information from employees via direct inquiry is not encouraged. The OFCCP is developing an Equal Opportunity Survey (EO Survey) to obtain employment information from selected Federal contractor establishments. The EO Survey will collect information about applicant and employee personnel activity, and employee compensation, by gender, race, and ethnicity, sorted by EEO-1 job categories. The survey requests that each applicant or employee be identified by gender, by Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin, and by one of the five racial categories. Contractors responding to the EO Survey have discretion to use the 1977 racial/ethnic categories if they have not yet converted their record keeping to the 1997 standards. Educational institutions, however, should follow the guidelines set forth in Section 3 on Equal Access to Education for reporting data on their employees. For reporting covering 2000 through 2002, employers (including contractors) and unions subject to these reporting requirements will continue to submit EEO-1, EEO-3, EEO-4, EEO-5, OFCCP EO Survey, and IPEDS Fall Staff Survey, in their respective current formats. Employers will use the new forms that reflect the 1997 standards starting in 2003 to provide data on the work force for the 2003 calendar year. b. Required Changes to EEO Forms and Instructions to Implement the 1997 Standards To be consistent with the 1997 standards, certain changes are planned for EEO reporting forms and instructions. These changes (along with updates to reflect changes in the industry and occupational classifications) will be submitted as usual under the Paperwork Reduction Act for OMB approval, allowing sufficient time so that non-Federal employers may prepare for their use starting in 2003. Data collections covering Federal employment will also be updated by OPM and EEOC to reflect the 1997 standards. OPM is engaged in ongoing discussions with numerous Federal agencies to develop a standardized approach for collecting and reporting data under the 1997 standards. The following changes are planned for the reporting forms and instructions: -- The ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"" racial category will be added. -- ""Asian"" will replace the category ""Asian or Pacific Islander.""  65   -- The following changes in terminology will be made: -- ""Alaska Native"" will replace the term ""Alaskan Native."" -- ""Black or African American"" will replace the term ""Black."" -- ""Hispanic or Latino"" will replace the term ""Hispanic."" -- Data on Hispanic or Latino ethnicity will be collected in a separate question for each occupational group. c. EEO Approach to Data Collection and Record Keeping Requirements Under the 1997 Standards Federal EEO agencies use a variety of reporting forms to collect and other establishments. These forms are subject to review and Paperwork Reduction Act. In redesigning EEO forms to comply following categories for race will be recommended for EEO data data from businesses, schools, approval by OMB under the with the 1997 standards, the collection and record keeping:  American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of individuals reporting more than one race The balance category will be used to report individual responses that are not included in any of the single race categories or in any of the two-race categories listed above. When Census 2000 data become available, the EEO agencies will undertake an analysis of the distribution of two-race combinations. This analysis will be undertaken, first, to confirm the four most common multiple race combinations found at the national level. If they are different from the four previously mentioned, the EEO proposed forms will be changed accordingly. Second, this analysis will be used to determine whether there are any additional multiple race combinations that should reported in the EEO proposed forms. In addition, the following changes in EEO data collections are being made as part of the implementation of the 1997 standards:  Self-identification will be the preferred method of collecting data on race and ethnicity in the employment setting.  66      Individuals will be permitted to report one or more races on applications and other forms pertaining to their employment. A two-question format will be used to obtain information on the ethnicity and race of each applicant or employee. The ethnicity question (Hispanic or Latino or Not Hispanic or Latino) will be asked first, followed by the race question. If an applicant or employee declines to self-report, employers may then determine the information on race and ethnicity required for reporting purposes by visual observation or from post-employment records.    d. Ensuring Common Approaches in EEO Enforcement As set forth by OMB in Bulletin No. 00-02 (see Appendix B), the following principles apply regarding data on race in enforcing employment discrimination laws and regulations:    Individuals who select only one racial category will be counted in that category. Individuals who select one minority race and White will be counted as part of that minority race. For the purpose of analyzing an enforcement action, responses of individuals who select more than one minority race will be allocated to the race involved in the enforcement action, if that race is among the ones they have selected. For example, where an enforcement action is based on complaints of discrimination on the basis of Black or African American, responses from individuals reporting themselves as Black or African American and American Indian or Alaska Native will be allocated into the Black or African American category for the purpose of analyzing the enforcement action. For nonenforcement-related analyses covering internal and external workforce distributions, several implementation issues remain unresolved at this time. For example, questions covering increased employer record keeping burdens under alternative allocation approaches must be examined further. Additionally, where the enforcement involves Federal litigation, questions remain to be resolved regarding judicial interpretation of both analytical methodology and admissible evidence standards that cover private and Federal lawsuits.    e. Resurveying the Workforce In converting to a new EEO-1 form in 2003 that reflects 1997 standards, employers will have to reconcile the 1997 standards with the pre-1997 standards under which employee race and ethnicity will be reported through 2002. In issuing the 1997 standards, OMB did not indicate  67   that employers, in implementing the new standards, would be required to resurvey incumbent employees whose race/ethnicity was originally classified under the pre-1997 standards. Each EEO agency will determine if resurveying should be required as part of its enforcement activity. Employers who report to more than one Federal agency, one of which requires resurveying, will be required to resurvey irrespective of whether the other Federal agencies impose the same requirement. After a careful review of the pros and cons associated with resurveying, EEOC may require resurveying as part of its record keeping and reporting requirement. EEOC seeks to ensure that the race and ethnicity reported by employees hired under the old standards prior to 2003, and by employees hired under the 1997 standard beginning with reports filed in 2003, will be consistent and comparable. EEOC is concerned that, unless resurveying is conducted, the racial identity of employees previously reported as Hispanic would be unknown. Complete racial and ethnic comparisons are needed to ensure data continuity and comparability, and to promote accuracy in enforcing EEO laws and regulations. 3. Equal Access to Education Another significant use of race and ethnicity data occurs in the context of the Federal Government's efforts to ensure that every individual has an equal opportunity for education and to collect and analyze data on the educational experience in America. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division are responsible for enforcement of the statutes that protect equal opportunity in education regardless of race, color, sex, national origin, age, or disability pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. OCR also monitors whether a recipient of Federal financial assistance has utilized criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The Department of Justice also enforces Title IV and Title VI, as well as the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, and also may intervene in private suits that allege violations of education related anti-discrimination statutes and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the National Center for Education Statistics is authorized to collect, analyze, and disseminate statistics on race and other population characteristics when such information would facilitate educational policy and decision making. a. Data Collection and Record Keeping Requirements Under the 1997 Standards On March 9, 2000, OMB issued Bulletin No. 00-02 (see Appendix B) providing guidance for Federal enforcement agencies in their use of data on race for civil rights monitoring and enforcement. The guidance indicates that for this purpose Federal agencies should aggregate data into the five single race categories, the four most frequently reported multiple race combinations, and any multiple race combinations that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest.  68   b. Racial and Ethnic Data in Educational Institutions Data on the race and ethnicity of students are critical to many sound educational practices and to monitoring and enforcing civil rights in educational institutions. The elimination of discrimination in educational institutions ensures that all individuals have equal access to educational opportunities. Although Federal enforcement agencies do not determine civil rights compliance based on numbers alone, analyzing student populations by race and other important factors can identify potential issues or problems. This information also enables schools to take proactive steps to prevent potential civil rights violations. Furthermore, assessing the performance of districts, schools, and students by examining information on race and ethnicity can serve important educational goals. Such assessments can allow schools to identify where new approaches or programs are needed and whether existing programs are serving the needs of all students. The Department of Education has received information from individual schools and states as well as anecdotal reports in the media that suggest that asking children to self-report their race may lead to higher multiple race reports when compared to adult self-reports. Some information indicates that this rate could be substantially higher, particularly in certain jurisdictions. For example, one state has informed Federal officials that 16 percent of its school age population would identify itself as more than one race (in contrast to the estimated 2 percent of the overall nationwide population). In this state, there is also evidence which suggests that some of these students are inconsistent in identifying their race and ethnicity; that is, they change their answers to race and ethnicity questions depending on the situation and/or over time. Moreover, there is research evidence that as children with multiple racial heritages age, they tend to identify with one race in somewhat larger numbers than when they were younger. Federal enforcement agencies must balance the interest in obtaining complete, detailed data to facilitate effective monitoring of the civil rights laws with the need to minimize the cost and burden on schools and colleges of collecting and reporting information. The collection and reporting of all possible combinations of race and ethnic categories would create an excessive burden for many, if not most, institutions. Further, such an excessive burden could dramatically slow the receipt of information on educational institutions and thereby delay the enforcement process. The Federal Government recognizes these potential burdens. Bulletin No. 00-02 states that ""we must minimize reporting burden for institutions such as schools and businesses that report aggregate data on race to Federal agencies."" The Bulletin also notes, however, that ""[a]s the revised standards for collecting and presenting data are implemented, we must ensure that we maintain our ability to monitor compliance with laws that offer protections for those who historically have experienced discrimination."" The Department of Education recognizes that educational institutions need to maintain consistency between changes affecting data on students and changes affecting data on staff and faculty. The Department of Education has elected to wait until after Census 2000 data are available to determine how educational institutions should aggregate racial and ethnic data for 69   their students and employees under the 1997 standards. Based on these data, the Department of Education will determine which race combinations (in addition to the five single race and four largest multiple race combinations) meet the one percent threshold for the relevant jurisdictions. The Department then will provide guidance to educational institutions on how racial and ethnic data should be aggregated and reported. c. Collection of Data on Race and Hispanic Ethnicity In addition to collecting data on race, the Department of Education and educational institutions at various state and local levels also collect information on Hispanic ethnicity. The tabulation of information on Hispanic ethnicity and race in light of the 1997 standards raises some challenging questions. As with the collection and aggregation of detailed data on race, the Department of Education recognizes the importance of obtaining more complete Hispanic origin information to facilitate effective civil rights monitoring and enforcement. However, the burden on educational institutions must be considered and balanced. There are three potential options for a unified tabulation approach for data on race and ethnicity. Some suggest that Hispanic or Latino data do not need to be tabulated by race. This suggestion is supported by an effort to minimize the burden on data collectors as well as evidence that many who identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino do not select a race (estimates range up to 30 percent). Others have suggested that the collection of data on race for those of Hispanic or Latino origin that mirror the non-Hispanic categories would create a symmetry that facilitates understanding and implementation. Alternatively, the collection of Hispanic or Latino data by some but not all racial categories could balance the need for the racial identification of Hispanics for civil rights enforcement with the burden on data collectors. Once the Department of Education reviews the results of Census 2000, the Department will reach a final decision on what data will be collected on the racial identification of Hispanic/Latino individuals. In general, educational agencies that collect data need three years from these final decisions to reconfigure their systems for the collection of racial and ethnic data under the 1997 categories. In the interim, educational institutions may collect information in greater detail than is presently required as long as any additional categories can be aggregated back into the minimum set of categories. 4. Enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 All agencies that enforce regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, are obligated to follow the guidance provided in this document and OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, which addresses aggregating and allocating data on race for civil rights enforcement and monitoring. The Title VI Coordination Regulations at 28 C.F.R.  42.406, provide that all agencies ""shall in regard to each assisted program provide for the collection of data and information from applicants for and recipients of Federal assistance sufficient to permit effective enforcement of [T]itle IV."" All agency Title VI regulations provide for the collection of such 70   data. Agencies currently follow the categories set forth in the Title VI Coordination Regulations, which ""are in conformity with the OMB Ad Hoc Committee on Race/Ethnic Categories' recommendations."" See 28 C.F.R.  42.302(e). The section states, however, that to the extent that these designations are modified by OMB, the regulation is to be interpreted to be consistent with any such OMB modifications. See 28 C.F.R.  42.402(e)(5). Accordingly, the categories listed in the regulation are no longer in effect. The 1997 revised standards, effective October 30, 1997, require all Federal agencies with Title VI compliance and enforcement obligations to provide for the collection of data by offering respondents the option of selecting one or more of the following racial categories: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White  Pursuant to OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, agencies are instructed to tabulate data on race using the five single race categories outlined above plus the following four multiple race combinations most likely to occur: 1. 2. 3. 4. American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American  Agencies are also advised to tabulate additional multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population at issue and include these combinations as part of any tabulation. Thus, all agency tabulations for data on race should reflect a minimum of ten categories: the five single race categories, the four multiple race categories, and a balance category. In surveys where there are additional multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population at issue, those categories should be included in any final tabulation. All agencies with Title VI enforcement responsibilities should also be aware that OMB Bulletin No. 00-02 provides guidance for the allocation of multiple race responses for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement. Pursuant to that guidance, the following rules apply:    Responses in the five single race categories will not be allocated. Responses that combine one minority race and white are allocated to the minority race. Responses that include two or more minority races are allocated as follows: 71      If the enforcement action is in response to a complaint, a multiple race response will be allocated to the race that the complainant alleges the discrimination was based on. If the enforcement action requires assessing disparate impact or discriminatory patterns, analyze the patterns based on alternative allocations to each of the minority groups.  Under the 1997 standards, ""Hispanic or Latino"" is an ethnic category, not a racial category. Where agencies collect data on race and ethnicity separately, ethnicity must be collected first. In such cases, provisions shall be made to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are ""Hispanic or Latino"" and who are ""Not Hispanic or Latino."" All agencies must modify all new and revised record keeping or reporting forms that include racial and/or ethnic information to conform to the 1997 standards. All existing record keeping or reporting requirements must be consistent with these standards at the time they are submitted for extension, but not later than January 1, 2003. Agencies should note that OMB is the final arbiter of all modifications to racial and ethnic categories used in Federal data collection instruments. Executive Order No. 12250 gives the Attorney General authority to ensure the consistent and effective enforcement of Title VI and other nondiscrimination statutes that apply to recipients of Federal financial assistance. That authority has been delegated to the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. The Division, through the Coordination and Review Section, will ensure that all agencies are aware of the 1997 standards and are taking appropriate steps to implement the OMB guidance. The Division's Coordination and Review Section will be available to Federal agencies to assist them in this endeavor. B. Intercensal Estimates and Vital Records Following some background discussion, this section presents a description of the Census Bureau's Intercensal Population Estimates Program, its data sources, methodology, and major uses, and then discusses some of the important issues that must be addressed in implementing the 1997 standards in this program. Background. In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting. Because the intercensal population estimates are limited in their detail by the availability of administrative data, it was 1993 before the program could implement fully the 1977 standards by providing data for the population in the four racial categories of that standard -- White; Black; Asian or Pacific Islander; and American Indian or Alaskan Native. To comply with the 1977 standards, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program developed estimates by race separately for the population by Hispanic origin (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic).  72   The 1997 standards present many challenges, with two in particular posing the greatest challenges. One is that respondents to Federal data collections, including Census 2000, surveys, and vital statistics registrations, will be allowed to select one or more races. The other is that the Asian or Pacific Islander category has been split into two categories -- one called ""Asian"" and the other called ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander."" The population estimates are data driven. Changes to the program to produce estimates for new racial categories will depend upon the availability of data from a variety of sources. Although changes are possible, discussions with data providers and data users, as well as research and analysis of data collected using the 1997 standards, will be required before the Census Bureau can identify the racial categories that can be used in the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Because the intercensal population estimates serve several diverse purposes, exploring the possible outcomes of the estimates process and examining the implications of the 1997 standards are important. The issues raised by the 1997 standards are complicated and diverse. It will take considerable research and experimentation before the Intercensal Population Estimates Program can produce population estimates that fully follow the 1997 standards. The next sections describe the program and discuss the major issues that must be addressed in changing program outputs. 1. Description of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program The Intercensal Population Estimates Program, under Title 13, develops and releases annual estimates of the total population and its demographic characteristics. For the Nation, states, and counties, these characteristics include annual estimates by: age (single years of age (age 0 to age 99) and 100+); sex (male/female); race (White; Black; Asian and Pacific Islander; and American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut); and Hispanic origin (Hispanic/Non-Hispanic). The Intercensal Population Estimates Program currently provides estimates of the total population of functioning governmental units (cities, incorporated places, and minor civil divisions). The Census Bureau is considering expansion of the program to include smaller and more diverse units of geography (such as school districts), as well as the development of demographic characteristics for functioning governmental units and other smaller geographic units. 2. Uses of Population Estimates The population estimates are used in the intercensal period for funding allocations, as controls for Census Bureau and other Federal surveys, as denominators for vital statistics and other demographic events, and as planning tools for government and private programs and policy decisions. 73   Funding Allocations. Federal programs totaling $180 billion use these annual population estimates to make program decisions and to distribute these funds. Survey Controls. The population estimates are used as control totals for the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the new American Community Survey (ACS), other Federal surveys, and many private sector surveys. Most Federal surveys use national level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. The ACS currently uses county level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. Denominators for Demographic Events. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) currently uses the national, state, and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators to create birth and death rates and to calculate life tables by race and sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) frequently relies upon the estimates of population at various geographic levels as denominators for various health related and disease incidence rates. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) uses the county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators for the various cancer incidence rates released to the public. Planning Tools. The intercensal population estimates are frequently used as planning tools and as barometers to measure an area's growth and change since the last decennial census. In making policy decisions, local planners frequently cite the overall population level and the demographic characteristics products of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. 3. Methodology for Developing Intercensal Population Estimates The Intercensal Population Estimates Program develops its population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin using the demographically recognized cohort-component technique. In this technique, each component of population change -- births, deaths, international migration, and internal migration -- is estimated separately by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Various administrative records provide information needed to develop these components of population change. The estimates process begins with the most recent decennial census results and combines the estimated components of population change to develop the intercensal population estimates. The 1990 Census Base Population. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net undercoverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made in the distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. (See Comparability Issues below for a discussion of the modification of the 1990 decennial census.)  74   Birth and Death Components. In brief, NCHS provides annual counts and distributions of births and deaths by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin by county to the Census Bureau in a specially developed individual record file of the birth and death events. These individual records contain the detailed race and Hispanic classifications available from the birth and death certificates collected by NCHS. International Migration Component. The international net migration components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. The Census Bureau estimates the distribution by race and Hispanic origin from the country-of-birth tallies, using data from the 1990 Census on the foreign-born population who entered the United States from 1985 to 1990. The other components of international migration such as emigration and undocumented migration are developed using a combination of basic demographic modeling techniques. By examining data from other administrative records in combination with an analysis of the decennial census, the Census Bureau models the level and demographic characteristics of these other international migration components. Internal Migration Component. Data on internal migration are developed using a basic administrative records method. This method relies on annual extracts of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In this approach, using the Social Security Number (SSN) on the return, the Census Bureau can match the tax returns for two years and obtain state of residence for the two periods. By comparing the state of residence at the two points in time, annual measures of migration can be developed for states. Until recently, the Census Bureau had only developed the national population estimates by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population for states and counties. During the current decade, the Census Bureau started to develop a set of state and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. The state population estimates are developed using the basic cohort component technique outlined above. Since the standard tax return provides no demographic characteristics of the tax filer, the Census Bureau must further modify the basic administrative records method to estimate internal migration by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To obtain demographic characteristics, the Bureau has relied on the annual extract of tax returns provided by the IRS, and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration (SSA) Application File (NUMIDENT). This NUMIDENT file includes SSN, month and year of birth, race, sex, and six characters of the last name for each SSN holder in the sample file. The extract of the NUMIDENT file has been merged with the tax returns file by SSN to derive demographic characteristics of IRS filers. Because the Census Bureau was able to receive only a 75   20 percent sample of this basic NUMIDENT file, the Bureau appended the demographic characteristics of the primary filer to only the same 20 percent sample of tax returns. Besides demographic characteristics of the primary filers, the model requires demographic characteristics of those persons claimed as exemptions on the tax return. The rules for assigning demographic characteristics to dependents are straightforward and rely on basic familial and demographic relationships. Because the NUMIDENT File was restricted to a 20 percent sample until this year, the Census Bureau could not use the merged tax file and SSA data to develop county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To develop the current sets of county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, a ratio approach is employed. This approach combines the full set of age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin detail for the county in 1990 with the newly developed state population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population of the county. With the delivery of the 100 percent NUMIDENT file to the Census Bureau, work on employing the cohort component technique to develop the county estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin is anticipated. 4. Data Availability The intercensal population estimates are ""data driven."" As noted above, the decennial census, the National Center for Health Statistics, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Social Security Administration are all important sources for developing intercensal population estimates. Using the current methodology, estimates cannot be produced without the availability of these data. Decennial Census Data. Census 2000 is the first time that decennial population data are available using the 1997 standards for collecting racial data. Birth and Death Data. The National Vital Statistics System is the basis for the Nation's official statistics on births and deaths (including infant deaths). The data are provided through vital registration systems maintained and operated by the individual states and territories where the original certificates are filed. While the legal authority for vital registration rests with the states and territories, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is required to produce national vital statistics by collecting data from the vital records of all the states. The NCHS cooperates with the states in developing the standard forms for data collection as well as standard procedures for data preparation and processing in order to promote a uniform national data base. The degree of uniformity necessary for national statistics has been achieved by periodic issuance of recommended standards by the responsible national agency (NCHS) and the cooperative adoption of these standards by the individual registration areas. These standards include the U.S. Standard Certificates of Live Birth. The standard certificates have been the principal means for achieving the uniformity in information on which national statistics are based; the standard certificate of live birth has been revised 11 times since 1900.  76   The standard certificates represent the minimum basic data set necessary for the collection and publication of comparable national, state, and local vital statistics data. Also participating in this effort to produce quality, consistent data is the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), the association of State registrars. Because the State certificates have multiple uses, many factors must be considered and evaluated in deciding what should be included in the recommended standards. Faced with the many uses -- legal, administrative, public health, statistical -- of vital records, NCHS and the state vital statistics offices must make choices regarding the inclusion or exclusion of data items for each revision of the certificate. The NCHS shares in the costs incurred by the states through contractual agreements with each state. Under this arrangement, NCHS obtains and publishes vital statistics based on all births and deaths (e.g., 3,891,494 and 2,314,690, respectively, in 1996) occurring in the United States. Implementation of the 1997 standards on vital records will require changes in data collection and processing systems at all levels of government and very likely will take at least several years to accomplish throughout the United States. In addition to revising computer systems at the state and Federal levels, the electronic software that is used in hospitals to record and report over 90 percent of all births in the United States needs to be converted. Most importantly, the procedures used to collect birth and death data in hospitals and funeral homes will need to be revised and the appropriate staff will need to be trained. During 1998 and 1999, NCHS sponsored a committee of state vital statistics officials and representatives of the relevant professions in a series of meetings to evaluate the entire content and format of the current Standard Certificates. It can be anticipated that not all registration areas will implement the 1997 standards at the same time or with complete coverage and compliance at the start. Only one state has implemented the revised race question on birth and death certificates in the year 2000. Most others will wait until the next revisions of the U.S. Standard Certificates of Birth and Death are implemented in 2003. International Migration Components. As discussed above, the international migration components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. To develop data on the race and Hispanic origin of the entering immigrants, the Census Bureau combines the information on country of birth from the INS files with information from the most recent decennial census. Because the INS and other data sources on international migration do not code race or Hispanic origin, no change in these sources is anticipated. The Census Bureau will need to examine the results of Census 2000 and develop new algorithms to accommodate the 1997 categories for data on race. 77   Internal Migration Components. To develop the internal migration component, the Census Bureau currently relies upon the annual extract of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration (SSA) Application File (NUMIDENT). Under an agreement between the Census Bureau and SSA, the Census Bureau has recently gained access to a full 100 percent NUMIDENT file. This opens additional opportunities for developing population estimates below the national level by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. This component also presents the biggest obstacle to modifying categories for data on race in the intercensal population estimates process. Under the Social Security system, data on race are provided as part of the Social Security card application process. For the oldest among the population currently covered in the NUMIDENT files, the last application date could refer to the beginning of the Social Security system. Until 1980, the SSA application system provided three racial categories -- White, Black, and Other. Beginning in 1980, the SSA modified the racial categories on the SSA application form to include five categories -- (1) Asian, Asian-American or Pacific Islander; (2) Hispanic; (3) Black (non-Hispanic); (4) North American Indian or Alaskan Native; (5) White (non-Hispanic). Although SSA modified the racial categories application card, people who already had an SSA card did not have to resubmit their data on race. Thus, pre-1980 entries on the SSA file have information for three racial categories (White, Black, and Other), while entries after 1980 have information for five racial categories. The application for a Social Security card needs to be updated to reflect the 1997 standards. Another change to the Social Security application procedure has presented challenges to the use of data on race. Beginning in the late 1980's, the SSA introduced the ""enumeration at birth program."" Under this program, parents could request a social security number for their newborn children with the birth registration process. Because the birth certificates do not include racial information for the newborn, it is impossible to code race for the newborn onto the SSA file. While information on race is available for the birth mother and father on the basic birth registration certificate, these data are not made available to SSA and are not on the basic NUMIDENT file received by the Census Bureau. 5. Comparability Issues Even the availability of the required source data does not ensure the capability to produce reasonable and accurate population estimates. Production of population estimates by the major demographic characteristics depends upon the availability of comparable data across the various data sources. While comparability issues with respect to race reporting are not new, the increased complexities of new racial categories are likely to exacerbate the problems. 78   The issues about comparability in race reporting are present in the current set of intercensal population estimates. Data from the 1990 census on race posed several of these problems. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net under coverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made to that distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. For age, the aim was to correct biases in census age tabulations that resulted from displacement of age reporting from the reference date of the census. In 1990 census publications, age is based on respondents' direct reports of age at last birthday, with some editing for age misstatement. This definition proved inadequate for postcensal estimates; many respondents reported their age (even if correctly) at the time of completion of the census form or interview by an enumerator, either of which could have occurred several months after the April 1 reference date. As a result, age was slightly biased upward. Modification was based on a respecification of age, for most individual respondents, according to their year of birth. Age was derived from year of birth by allocating date of birth to the first quarter and last three quarters of each year, subtracting year of birth from 1990 for those born before April 1, and from 1989 for those born after April 1. The allocation was based on an historical series of registered births by month. For race, the objective of the modification was to conform to the definition of race specified in the 1977 standards. In the 1990 census, a substantial number of people (roughly 9.8 million) did not specify a racial group that could be classified in any of the categories on the census form: White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander. A large majority of these people were of Hispanic origin (based on their response to a separate, Hispanic origin question on the form), and many wrote in their Hispanic origin, or Hispanic origin type (for example, Mexican or Puerto Rican) as their race. People of unspecified race were allocated to one of the four tabulated racial groups (White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo or Aleut; and Asian or Pacific Islander) based on their response to the Hispanic origin question. These four categories for race conform with the 1977 standards, and are more consistent with the categories in other administrative sources than are the original census tabulations. When combining across data sets and agencies, the problems of comparability in reporting of race become more severe. Clearly, the added complexity of reporting more than one race will add to this problem, particularly as different reporting situations (such as the census or the birth and death certificates) engender differential tendencies to report more than one race. Differences in allocation and editing procedures will almost certainly exacerbate the problem as exemplified by the problem of using data from different data universes in the calculation of rates.  79   Comparability of race data from the Census 2000 and from vital statistics will be more problematic until the Vital Statistics System adopts the new data collection standards in 2003. NCHS, Census Bureau, and OMB jointly sponsored a workshop in July 2000 which was conducted by the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department of The George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services and the Metropolitan Washington Public Health Assessment Center. The aim of the workshop was to develop a research agenda designed to address these problems. Workshop participants identified several research strategies that could be used to address the technical and methodological issues that the 1997 standards for data on race and ethnicity raise for vital statistics and population estimates, and to address some of the more conceptual and perceptual aspects of race and ethnicity that influence reporting in censuses, surveys, and vital records. A summary of the workshop is being prepared. Selected research strategies are summarized below: Census or Survey-based Matching Studies: In such studies, the race and ethnicity reported on birth or death certificates could be compared with the race and ethnicity reported for those individuals in the decennial census or surveys such as the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey. The participants also recommended the continuation of the National Longitudinal Mortality Studies. Studies of Selected Vital Records: Although NCHS works with the states to establish a standard set of data on births and deaths to be reported to the Federal Government, the original data collection process is established and managed by each individual state. As a result, some states are collecting additional data on race and ethnicity that could be used to study features of race and ethnicity reporting in vital records and to explore how reporting may change under the 1997 standards. NCHS is investigating the possibility of obtaining additional race information for a selected number of states for methodological purposes. Studies to Identify Sources of Error: A careful study of the potential sources of error -both bias and random variation -- in the data and procedures used to produce population estimates would provide valuable guidance to both the producers and users of those estimates. Some of the sources of error include the census undercount and undercount adjustments, missing data and imputation procedures, and misreporting and misclassification of data. The 1997 standards will not change the types of error in the data but will introduce specific new forms of error, such as misreporting or misclassification between single- and multiple-race categories, that need to be  80   understood. The proposed matching studies would help identify and quantify some types of bias in the data. Techniques like multiple imputation can be used to assess variance. Studies of the accuracy of estimates and projections: The Census Bureau produces population estimates and projections for states and communities, but states also produce independent estimates of their populations, which may differ from Census Bureau estimates. Studies are needed to compare the accuracy of Census Bureau and state estimates and to identify the sources of discrepancy. Studies on Race and Ethnicity: Proposals for other studies emphasized opportunities to improve data on race and ethnicity by gaining a better understanding of the meaning of racial and ethnic identities in society and of the factors that influence both selfidentification and identification of others. One suggestion was to look at how race and ethnicity were reported in Census 2000 for those in multiple race households. Studies might also use routinely conducted surveys like the Current Population Survey or the National Health Interview Survey to ask about the race of respondents' parents and other ancestors to learn more about the older roots of multiple race identities. An additional source of noncomparability results from the fact that the standard certificate of live birth includes items asking for the race of the mother and the race of the father. At no time have the certificates included a question on the race of the child. In 1988 and prior years, NCHS assigned a race to the child solely for statistical purposes. Births were tabulated by this assigned race of the child, which was created from information reported for the race(s) of the parents as entered on the birth certificate. When the parents were of the same race, as was the case for 95 percent of births with race reported for both mother and father in 1998, the child was assumed to be of the same race. If the parents were of different races and one parent was white, the child was assigned the race of the parent who was not white. When the parents were of different races, and neither parent was white, the child was assigned, for statistical purposes, to the father's race, with one exception: if either parent was Hawaiian, the child was assigned to Hawaiian. If race was missing for one parent, the child was assigned the race of the parent for whom race was reported. In 1989, NCHS changed its tabulation procedures and began tabulating births by the race of the mother. The most important factor influencing this decision was the 1989 revision of the birth certificate. This revision includes many more health questions that are directly associated with the mother (e.g., method of delivery, medical risk factors, tobacco and alcohol use, and maternal weight gain). Many of the other items that have been on the birth certificate since 1969 or even earlier also relate directly to the mother; for example, age, educational level, and receipt of prenatal care. In all these instances it is more appropriate to tabulate births by the mother's race.  81   A second factor influencing the decision to tabulate births by race of mother is the large proportion of births with race of father not reported, 14 percent in 1998. Although this proportion has declined slightly in the 1990's, it is still higher than in 1978, 11 percent. The high proportion of records with the father's race not reported reflects the increase in the proportion of births to unmarried women; in many such cases, no information is reported on the father. These births are already assigned the race of the mother because there is no alternative. Tabulating all births by race of mother, therefore, provides for a more uniform approach, rather than a necessarily arbitrary combination of parental races. It is important to keep in mind that the public use data files that NCHS produces and disseminates include both the mother's and father's races as reported on the birth certificate. Researchers and others may tabulate the birth data by race of the mother, by race of the father, or by race of the child as determined by the algorithm previously used by NCHS, or an alternative as they wish. For purposes of research based on data from the birth certificate itself, it is generally most appropriate to tabulate the birth data by the race of the mother. NCHS has re-tabulated all of the trend data on births by race of mother for the years beginning with the 1980 data year. To facilitate continuity and analysis of the data, trend tables showing data for years prior to 1980 show data for both race of mother and race of child. This makes it possible to distinguish the effects of this change from real changes in the data. There continues to be interest in collecting and reporting birth data according to the ""race of the child"" and this would be particularly relevant for developing population estimates. Over the last several years, this concept has been discussed by the panel charged with developing the forthcoming revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. The panel revising the certificate did not recommend that an item on the child's race be added to the birth certificate. As mentioned earlier, each state has its own certificate of live birth, and in most cases state certificates closely follow the content and format of the U.S. Standard Certificate. Individual states may choose to add an item asking for the ""race of the child,"" even though the item is not on the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. NCHS and colleagues in state vital statistics offices continue to research this issue. 6. Future Direction The process of developing a set of intercensal population estimates consistent with the 1997 standards will not be an easy one. Until data are available, making any commitments about the probable set of products is impossible. The Census Bureau realizes, however, that many data users need to know its plans in order to make their own program decisions. To begin this process, the Census Bureau is forming a technical interagency group of key data providers and key data users to address many of the major issues. Members of this group will 82   provide input on: (1) the feasibility of using one consistent set of categories on race across all geographic levels; (2) the feasibility of using population size as the only criterion for determining which categories by race will have separate population estimates; (3) the minimum cell size below which population estimates will not be produced; (4) the continued development of population estimates by mutually exclusive categories on race; and (5) the use of consistent methodologies for the different categories by race in the population estimates program. This technical group will also examine issues related to data allocation and editing -- important factors related to the data consistency issues. Detailed data on race from Census 2000 will not be available until mid 2001. In the meantime, the interagency group can address and reach consensus on most of the issues outlined above. Through these discussions with the data providers and data users, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program can begin to form some tentative plans. Although it is too soon to speculate on any outcomes, it is likely that the Intercensal Population Estimates Program will need to be flexible. During the coming decade, as more data become available using the 1997 standards, it is likely that the Census Bureau will continue the expansion of the population estimates program to include additional categories by race. C. Uniform Crime Reporting Program The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program was established by the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 1929. The UCR Program has as its primary mission the collection of uniform national crime statistics for the express purpose of assisting law enforcement across the Nation in strategic planning in the war against crime. Currently, nearly 17,000 city, county, and state law enforcement agencies voluntarily participate in the program. Even though it is often assumed that UCR statistics consist of a monolithic statistical collection effort, the UCR Program in reality comprises several programs, all with different data collection requirements. Approximately 89 percent of the crime reported to the FBI is through the Summary Reporting System. The Summary System reflects aggregate tallies of crime information from law enforcement agencies, and the collection of data on race is limited to arrest information only. UCR data are additionally collected through the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted Program, the Hate Crime Data Collection Program, and the National Incident-Based Reporting System  all of which provide for the collection of data on race. Race is usually determined by observation on the part of the responding officer or the victim of the crime, rather than self-identification. Any effort to collect information on race by self-identification is either difficult or impossible due to the reliance on third-party information or the sensitive nature of handling the response to a criminal incident.  83   The information collected in the UCR Program is a complex derivative of law enforcement operational databases. As such, the primary application of any UCR statistics, including those involving race, is by law enforcement in the examination of crime trends. The data provide law enforcement a unique means by which to conduct analyses, ranging from limited agency-specific to broadly multijurisdictional, in order to plan strategically for the maximum use of limited law enforcement resources. In concurrence with other national criminal justice operational databases managed by the FBI (e.g., National Crime Information Center and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, etc.), the UCR Program currently uses the four race categories specified by the 1977 standards. Incorporation of the 1997 standards into the UCR Program is being considered within the context of the burden such implementation would place upon law enforcement agencies in their participation in a voluntary program, and the feasibility of collecting the information in accordance with the 1997 standards within the confines of the normal law enforcement operational setting.  84   CHAPTER 5 COMPARING DATA COLLECTED UNDER THE 1997 AND THE 1977 STANDARDS This chapter is a summary of the Bridge Report: Tabulation Options for Trend Analysis, which is provided in Appendix C. A. Introduction Agencies whose data are used to display time trends in economic, social, and health characteristics by racial and ethnic groups may need to consider bridging methods to assist users in understanding the data collected under the 1997 standards. For some period of time, referred to as the bridge period, agencies may use two estimates. The first, a tabulation of the data collected under the 1997 standards (see Chapter 3, Part B), and the second, a ""bridging estimate"" or prediction of how the responses would have been collected and coded under the 1977 standards. The bridging estimate is designed only for analyzing historical trends in data series. Once the bridge period is over, the bridge estimates will no longer be needed. It should not be assumed that bridging is useful or required in every situation. Agencies should carefully consider whether they need bridging estimates. Bridging estimates may not be needed if agencies can tolerate a ""break"" in their data series or if comparison to another data series provides users with enough information about the change. If bridging estimates are not used, however, agencies should footnote the first occurrence of data collected under the 1997 standards. There are at least two purposes of bridge estimates: (1) to help users understand the relationship between the old and new data series (as noted above); and (2) to provide consistent numerators and denominators for the transition period, before all data are available in the new format. If there is a need for bridging, agencies should carefully evaluate alternative methods. The work presented in Appendix C, and summarized below, is intended to help inform agencies about the statistical characteristics of selected bridging methods. Agencies are encouraged to plan and conduct methodological research that will lead to more informed decisions concerning bridging methods and their uses. Such methodological research has long been used to quantify changes in data collection procedures. For example, when methods for coding industry, occupation, or diseases are updated, it is common practice to code data using both sets of coding rules to determine the nature and extent of the changes introduced by the change in procedures.  85   The analyses presented in Appendix C make use of survey data in which the same respondent provided racial information in response to both a question structured under the 1977 standards and to questions similar to those that might be structured under the 1997 standards. These are examples of methodological approaches that can be adopted by agencies, if necessary. In particular, since 1976, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has added a follow-up question for those reporting more than one racial identity, asking them to select the one that they feel best describes them. This information is directly used in some of the most promising bridge techniques. Some agencies may want to use such a follow-up question experimentally to provide valuable, survey-specific information for bridging to the past. As agencies conduct such experiments, the results may assist other agencies in understanding the changes associated with transitioning to the 1997 standards. The results discussed here and in Appendix C represent the work of a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from Federal statistical agencies that use and produce data on race and ethnicity. They have spent the past three years considering these tabulation issues and conducting research to develop tabulation guidelines for constructing ""bridges"" between racial data collected under the 1997 standards and racial data collected under the 1977 standards. The report sets forth criteria by which different bridging methods should be evaluated and describes the different methods that have been considered thus far. The results of the research conducted on several methods for creating bridges are also presented. This part of the report discusses different options for tabulating racial data in order to create bridges from data collected under the 1997 standards, which have five racial categories and permit the reporting of more than one race, back to the data collected under the previous standards, which identified four racial categories and asked respondents to select one. An ""Other"" category appears in much of the analysis, because it is included in the decennial census and some other surveys. All of these methods (and the research on them reported here) involve the use of individual-level records. Analysis is limited to data collected using the separate questions for race and Hispanic origin. Under the 1997 standards, when reporting is based on self-identification, the twoquestion format is to be used; even in the case of observer identification, this is the preferred format. It is expected that some users will bridge to a distribution created using the combined format for the question on race and ethnicity. Thus, bridging both to the old racial distribution arising from the use of two questions and one based on a combined, single question are analyzed. The latter analyses required the creation of a combined distribution from data collected using the two-question format. It should be clearly understood that this is a ""manufactured"" distribution and may be different from one obtained when actually using a combined question format. Based on the research, the strengths and weaknesses of each bridging method are discussed. The last two sections of this chapter discuss weighting data collected under the 86   1997 standards to 1990-based population controls and suggested bridging strategies for users of the new racial and ethnic data. B. Methods for Bridging The goal of developing bridging methodology for data on race is to identify a statistical model that will take individuals' responses to the new questions on race and classify those responses as closely as possible to the responses we hypothesize they would have given using the old single race categories. Such a task will be relatively easy or be more difficult depending on how an individual identifies himself or herself under the 1997 standards. For bridging purposes, individuals with a single racial background are likely to identify as they did before, and no statistical model is needed for bridging. However, those with a mixed racial heritage who were previously required to identify only one part of their background may, under the 1997 standards, choose to report more than one racial identity. When a person identifies with more than one racial group, some model will be necessary to translate those multiple responses into the one, single response we hypothesize that the individual most likely would have reported under the 1977 standards. 1. Framework Several different methods have been identified for creating a single race distribution from data including multiple race responses. These methods vary in both the assumptions that are made and the procedures that are followed. Before describing the particular methods examined in this report, it is useful to describe some of their major underlying characteristics. One major distinction among the methods is whether an individual's responses are assigned to a single racial category (termed whole assignment) or to multiple categories (termed fractional assignment). Whole assignment can be based on a set of deterministic rules or based on some probabilistic distribution. For example, a deterministic rule might assign all White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, while a probabilistic rule might randomly assign 60 percent of the White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, and 40 percent into the White category. In the above example, it is unlikely that all individuals identifying as White and American Indian under the 1997 standards would have previously identified as American Indian, so the deterministic rule will result in misclassifications for all those people who had previously identified as White. With a probabilistic rule, an individual's responses are randomly assigned to either the American Indian category or the White category (such as with 60 percent and 40 percent probabilities, respectively, based on previously collected data). However, even if the overall probabilities matched exactly the aggregate distribution under the 1977 standards, there is no guarantee that the 40 percent who were categorized as White would have classified themselves that way. In fact, in the worst case, 87   all 40 percent who were classified as White would actually have identified as American Indian under the 1977 standards, and a corresponding percentage of those categorized as American Indian would have identified as White. When fractional assignment is used, multiple race responses are categorized into more than one category where each category receives a fraction of a count, and the sum of the fractions equals one. In the above examples of whole assignment, a person's responses were placed into one and only one category, in an attempt to mimic the past. An alternative is to use a deterministic rule to assign some fraction of the multiple race responses to each of the racial categories identified. For example, a multiple response of White and American Indian might count as ""one-half"" in the tabulations for American Indians and ""one-half"" in the tabulations for Whites. These fractions, like the probabilities in the earlier example, could be varied for different combinations of multiple races to attempt to reflect how often people might identify with one group compared with another. 2. Bridge Tabulation Methods All of the bridge tabulation methods focus on the assignment of the responses from individuals who identify with more than one racial group. Responses from individuals who identify with a single racial group under the 1997 standards are assumed to have been the same under the 1977 standards. The response ""Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander"" is assigned to the old racial category of ""Asian or Pacific Islander."" The specific methods for assigning multiple race responses into single race categories are Deterministic Whole Assignment, Deterministic Fractional Assignment, and Probabilistic Whole Assignment. Two sets of results for each of the following tabulation methods are produced. The first set ignores the use of any auxiliary information other than that needed to carry out the particular tabulation method. The other set of results for each method uses the one piece of information that is certain to be common to all data collections done following the 1997 standards, that is, ethnicity. Thus, whether or not an individual is Hispanic is taken into account when a tabulation method is used. Deterministic whole assignment. This method uses fixed, deterministic rules for assigning multiple responses back to one and only one of the racial categories from the 1977 standards. Four alternatives are examined. The first (Smallest Group) assigns responses that include White and another group to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the fewest number of individuals identifying that group as a single race. The second alternative (Largest Group Other Than White) assigns responses that include White with some other racial group, to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the highest single-race 88   count. The third alternative (Largest Group) assigns responses with two or more racial groups into the group with the largest number of individuals as a single race. In this latter case, any combination with White is assigned to the White category, and combinations that do not include White are assigned to the group with the largest single-race count. The fourth alternative (Plurality) assigns responses based on data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS has permitted respondents to select more than one race for a number of years, with only the first two responses captured. However, respondents reporting more than one race were given a follow-up question asking them to select the one race with which they most closely identify (called Main Race here). For these respondents, the proportion choosing each of the two possibilities as their main race was calculated. All responses in a particular multiple-race category using the Plurality method are assigned to the group with the highest proportion of responses on the follow-up question about main race. Deterministic fractional assignment. This method uses fixed, deterministic rules for fractional weighting of multiple-race responses, that is, assigning a fraction to each one of the individual racial categories that are identified. These fractions must sum to 1. Two alternatives are examined. The first (Deterministic Equal Fractions) assigns each of the multiple responses in equal fractions to each racial group identified. Thus, responses with two racial groups are assigned half to each group; those with three groups are assigned one-third to each, etc. The second alternative (Deterministic NHIS Fractions) assigns responses by fractions to each racial group identified, with the fractions drawn from empirical results from the NHIS (as described above). Probabilistic whole assignment. This method uses probabilistic rules for assigning multiple race responses back to one and only one of the previous racial categories. Two alternatives are examined. These parallel the two alternatives discussed under Deterministic Fractional Assignment, except that, for a given set of fractions, the response is assigned to only one racial category. The fractions specify the probabilities used to select a particular category. The first alternative uses equal selection probabilities. The second uses the NHIS fractions where possible, and equal fractions when no information is available from NHIS. Probabilistic Whole Assignment will yield nearly, on average, the same population counts as Deterministic Fractional Assignment. Only the results from Deterministic Fractional Assignment are presented in this report. In practice, there would be a difference between Deterministic Fractional Assignment and Probabilistic Whole Assignment when computing variances for tabulated estimates, and the two methods would yield relatively small differences in distributions for respondent characteristics. In general, Probabilistic Whole Assignment would yield a higher estimated variance than the Deterministic Fractional approach, with the variances for both methods underestimating the true variance. Probabilistic methods which incorporate a ""Multiple Imputation"" statistical technique 89   would result in an unbiased estimate of variance, but at the price of being more difficult to implement (See Rubin 1987.). All Inclusive. A final tabulation method considered is termed the ""All Inclusive"" method. Under this method all responses are used. Responses are assigned to each of the categories that an individual selects. The sum of the categories totals more than 100 percent. C. Methods of Evaluation 1. Data Sources National Health Interview Survey. The NHIS is a continuing nationwide sample survey designed to measure the health status of residents of the United States (Benson and Marano, 1995; Massey et al., 1989). The analysis here uses data from an analytic file that contains three years of NHIS data (1993, 1994, and 1995). For each of these years there were about 45,000 households interviewed, resulting in slightly more than 100,000 individuals per year. The total sample for the bridge analysis is 323,080 (5237 respondents did not provide data on race). Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to choose more than one racial category. As the respondent is handed a card with numbered racial categories, the interviewer asks, ""What is the number of the group or groups that represents your race?"" If a respondent selects more than one category, the interviewer then asks, ""Which of those groups would you say best describes your race?"" Although the listed racial groups have changed over time, for 1993 to 1995, the card shown to respondents included 16 separate racial categories (White, Black, American Indian, Aleut, Eskimo, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Asian Indian, Samoan, Guamanian, and other Asian and Pacific Islander. In addition, although not on the flashcard, respondents were allowed to give an ""other"" race response.) To be consistent, the 16 groups were collapsed to the four previous racial categories: White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN), and Asian or Pacific Islander (API), plus Other. For this analysis, a variable called Detailed Race was created from responses to the first question, which allowed identification with more than one racial group. This information is not included on public use data files of the NHIS. However, on internal files, the first two race groups mentioned are recorded for each observation. Even if a respondent selected more than two groups, only two were recorded on the intermediate file. From the two recorded racial responses, Detailed Race was coded into five single race groups (White, Black, AIAN, API, Other) and 11 multiple race groups (White/Black, White/AIAN, White/API, White/Other, Black/AIAN, Black/API, Black/Other, AIAN/API, AIAN/Other, and API/Other. For most analyses, multiple race combinations that had insufficient numbers were aggregated into the 90   category ""Other Combinations."") Individuals who had two racial groups recorded for Detailed Race but a third group recorded for the ""group that best describes race"" were coded into ""Other Combinations."" The Main Race variable, used as a reference point representing the racial distribution under the 1977 standards, is primarily derived from Detailed Race and the responses to the second question, which asks the respondent for the group that best describes his/her race (Benson and Marano, 1995). For respondents who selected one Detailed Race group, Main Race is the same as Detailed Race. For respondents who selected more than one racial group, Main Race is the one group reported as best describing their race. Some respondents who had chosen more than one race for the Detailed Race question responded as ""Multiple race"" or ""Other"" for the Main Race question. For this analysis, these responses were combined into the ""Other"" category. Categories for Main Race were White, Black, AIAN, API, and Other. The combined race and ethnicity variable, referred to here as ""Combined Main Race,"" uses the respondent's answer to an Hispanic origin question to reassign the respondent to the Hispanic category. The Hispanic origin question used is the following: Are any of these groups (the respondent's) national origin or ancestry? At the same time, the interviewer hands the respondent a card listing Hispanic groups as categories: Puerto Rican, Mexican, Cuban, Mexican American, Chicano, Other Latin American, and Other Spanish. For this report, Whites, Blacks, Others, and those reporting more than one race who identified with any of the Hispanic groups were categorized as Hispanic and not according to their race. Asians, American Indians, and Alaska Natives were not reclassified. If a respondent did not answer the Hispanic origin question, he or she was assumed to be non-Hispanic. May 1995 Supplement on Race and Ethnicity to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The May 1995 CPS Supplement was one in a series of studies conducted for the Federal agencies' review of the standards for data on race and ethnicity. The Supplement was designed to address the following issues: (1) the effect of having a ""multiracial"" race category among the list of races; (2) the effect of adding ""Hispanic"" to the list of racial categories; and (3) the preferences for alternative names for racial and ethnic categories (e.g., African-American for Black, and Latino for Hispanic). The Supplement was organized into four panels representing a two-by-two experimental design for studying the first and second issues outlined above. Each panel was given to one-fourth of the sample, or about 15,000 households (30,000 individuals). All respondents in a household received the same set of questions; household members 15 years and older were asked to respond for themselves, and parents answered for children under 15. Only two of the panels in the CPS Supplement permitted respondents to report in a multiracial category (panels 2 and 4), and only one panel had separate race and Hispanic origin questions (panel 2) as ultimately recommended in the 1997 standards. Therefore, panel 2 data were used 91   to analyze the effects of the different tabulation methods for the two-question format. The new Hispanic question, preceding the race question, simply asked whether or not the respondent was Hispanic. The smaller sample (about 30,000 observations) hampers analysis and generalizations when the focus is on the small portion of the sample (about 1 percent) who identified as ""multiracial."" There are additional limitations to these data for evaluating the bridging methods. The option respondents were given to identify multiple races in the CPS Supplement was a multiracial category with a follow-up question asking respondents to indicate all the racial groups with which they identified. The 1997 standards allow people to identify directly with all the racial groups they choose and do not include a ""multiracial"" category. Furthermore, a large percentage of individuals who chose the multiracial category in panel 2 of the Supplement did not specify more than one racial group (see Tucker et al., 1996). For purposes of this evaluation, individuals were classified as belonging to the specific racial categories they identified. Those who identified as being multiracial but then did not give two or more specific racial groups were reclassified in the one racial category they gave. Thus, the distribution of the CPS Supplement data reported here differs from that which was published in earlier reports, which classified as multiracial any person who identified with the multiracial category even if they only specified one racial group. This new distribution is referred to here as the ""Edited Distribution."" This edited distribution was used with the various tabulation methods. As in NHIS, the resulting distributions were compared to a reference distribution based on the respondents' original answers (in the first CPS interview) to the race question that followed the 1977 standards. The combined race and ethnicity format, still referred to as the reference distribution in the relevant tables, uses the respondent's answer to the Hispanic origin question to reassign the respondent to the Hispanic category. For this report, Whites, Blacks, Others, and those reporting more than one race who identified with any of the Hispanic groups were categorized as Hispanic and not according to their race. Asians, American Indians, and Alaska Natives were not reclassified. If a respondent did not answer the Hispanic origin question, he or she was assumed to be non-Hispanic. 1998 Washington State Population Survey. The 1998 Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) was designed to provide information on Washington residents between decennial censuses. The survey collected data on employment, income, education, and health, along with basic demographic information. The WSPS was done by telephone and included 7,279 households with telephones. Blacks, Asians, Hispanics and American Indians were over sampled. The designated respondent was the individual with the greatest knowledge about the household. The respondent weights reflect this over sampling and, thus, results are representa-  92   tive of the Washington population as a whole. The response rate for the entire sample was between 50 and 60 percent. Information about the race of the respondent was collected twice during the course of the interview. At the beginning of the survey, the respondent was asked, ""Are you of Hispanic origin?"" Following that question, the respondent was asked, ""What is your race?"" The categories were the ones appearing under the 1977 standards, but the order was as follows: Black; American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; Asian or Pacific Islander; and White. An ""Other"" category also was allowed, and the interviewer recorded the verbatim response on a ""specify"" line. Near the end of the survey, the respondent was asked race questions conforming to the 1997 standards. Besides the same Hispanic origin question, the respondent was asked to specify country of origin. For race, the respondent was asked to select one or more categories. This time the ordering of the categories was White; Black or African American (or Haitian or Negro); American Indian or Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Asian. Again, an ""Other"" category was provided. There also was a follow-up question for Asian respondents to specify country of origin. The results from the race question at the end of the survey were used with the tabulation methods. The reference distribution came from the answers to the original race question. A combined race/ethnicity format was not created from the WSPS data because unedited information from the race question using the 1977 format was unavailable. 2. Advantages and Disadvantages of These Data Sources Only the Washington State data closely resemble the way the question on race will be asked under the 1997 standards. Yet, all three can offer insights into the relationship between how individuals will actually respond to the 1997 question on race and how they responded to the question under the 1977 standards. The NHIS and the CPS Supplement are nationally representative, and the Washington State data serve as an example for evaluating the tabulation methods at the state level. Simulations using 1990 census data also were conducted, but the results differed little from those for the other data sets. At this point, it is believed that an analysis of data from the 1998 Dress Rehearsal for Census 2000 would be of greater utility. Furthermore, the Dress Rehearsal data will provide examples of the effects of the 1997 standards at the local level. Thus, this analysis will be included in the next version of this report. 3. Description of New Analyses The analyses concentrated on the bridge tabulation methods. These analyses can be divided into three broad areas: (1) descriptions of racial distributions under the alternative bridging tabulation methods; (2) rates of racial ""misclassification"" for these alternatives; and, (3) sensitivity of outcome measures to the bridging alternatives.  93   Distribution of Race. For the first phase of the analysis (using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the data from Washington State), the distributions of race under the allocation alternatives described previously were calculated: All Inclusive, Deterministic Whole Allocation (Smallest Group, Largest Group Other Than White, Largest Group, and Plurality) and Fractional Allocation (Equal Fractions and NHIS Fractions). These new distributions were compared to the reference distribution in each data set. At this time, it is unknown what percentage of people in the United States will identify with more than one racial group when given the opportunity to do so in Census 2000 and in subsequent surveys. For purposes of illustrating the effects of a greater proportion of individuals identifying more than one racial background, analyses were conducted increasing the proportion of multiple race responses two-, four-, six- and eight-fold using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State micro data sources. The racial distributions were compared using each of the tabulation methods to see effects with increasing levels of reporting more than one race. Of necessity, these tabulations assume that the increases are the same across the different combinations of more than one race. The accuracy of this assumption cannot be tested. The purpose of these analyses is not to attempt to make accurate predictions about the extent of multiple race reporting or its composition, but rather to see more clearly possible differences among tabulation methods that may become apparent only with a greater percentage of more than one race reporting. Misclassification of Race. Besides evaluating the overall racial distributions produced by the tabulation methods, the misclassification of individuals also needs to be examined. For the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State survey, these misclassification rates were formed by comparing an individual's answer to the race question under the 1977 standards to the assigned category of the individual's response(s) to the race question under the 1997 standards using each of the tabulation methods. The misclassification rate and its standard error for each race by tabulation method were produced. Preliminary Outcomes Assessment. In the last phase of the analysis, the impact of multiplerace reporting on outcome measures was assessed. This process is important because users in many of the Federal agencies are not typically examining race distributions, but rather trends and indicators for the Nation (e.g., health outcomes, economic well-being, educational attainment) across racial groups. This is where the majority of work will need to be done within individual agencies as the 1997 standards are implemented. An initial examination of how common statistics could be affected by reporting of more than one race was conducted. Five outcome measures were examined, three from the NHIS and two from the CPS Supplement. From the NHIS, three routine health outcomes were calculated: percent of respondents in poor or fair health, percent of children living with a single mother, and percent of respondents with no health insurance. From the CPS Supplement, the proportions of respondents who were unemployed and the labor force participation rates for different racial groups were calculated. These estimates based on the bridging alternatives are not meant to be precise measures of these 94   factors, but are used to demonstrate the possible impact reporting of multiple races and the tabulation methods may have on these and similar estimates. D. Examination of the Results with Respect to the Evaluation Criteria Bridging to the past will be needed for measuring change in a variety of circumstances. Besides measuring population growth, any number of economic, social, and health outcomes must be monitored. This work will involve different population groups at different levels of geography. As a first step toward providing the information users will need to make informed decisions about the methods, the strengths and weaknesses of the bridging methods with respect to the evaluation criteria outlined at the beginning of this report are discussed, based on the results of the statistical analyses conducted. The details of these statistical analyses can be found in Appendix C. Measure Change Over Time. As indicated earlier, measuring change over time is the criterion that is of greatest importance in evaluating the bridging methods. The first and second phases of the analysis shed light on the performance of the various methods in this area. In essence, an ideal bridging method in this case is one that not only accurately recreates the population distribution under the 1977 standards such that the only difference remaining is a function of true change over time, but also assigns an individual's response to the old category that would have been chosen. The methodology used in these studies allows users, within limits, to see how well the bridging methods using racial data collected under the 1997 standards can match data from the same respondents collected (at about the same time) under the 1977 standards. To the extent that there is a match, any change that would occur from this point forward would indicate true change. If the match is poor, it is not possible to isolate the true change. When comparing the different methods to their reference distributions (whether using only the race question or the combined format), the racial categories that were most sensitive to which method is chosen were the numerically small ones, particularly the AIAN category. While different data sets were used in each study and the racial questions were not the same, the studies indicate that the Largest Group Deterministic Whole Assignment method, the Plurality method, and the two Deterministic Fractional Assignment methods produce distributions closer to the reference distributions than do the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method. Controlling for ethnicity had no effect on these results. One reason the Largest Group Assignment method results are so close is that it has little effect on the smaller racial groups, because most assignments are made to Black or White, and the percentages for these two races are so large that the relatively small increase they receive is not noticeable. The Plurality method produces a good fit, because it makes assignments at the level of specific racial combinations. The performance of the NHIS Fractional Assignment method can be discounted to a degree in the NHIS study because the analysis is somewhat circular; however, the results 95   from the CPS Supplement and the Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) show this method yields a relatively close match. The Equal Fractional Assignment method produces a reasonable match in these studies. The primary reason that the other two Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method do not perform as well is that they alter the White percentage to some extent and substantially increase the percentage in the AIAN category. In the case of misclassification rates, some contradictory results emerge, both when using the race question alone and when using the combined format. While the AIAN and ""Other"" categories have high misclassification rates across all tabulation methods in the CPS Supplement, the same is not true for the other two surveys. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment methods produce the most comparable results for the AIAN category in both surveys and for the ""Other"" category in the WSPS; however, these methods have higher overall misclassification rates. Both the CPS Supplement and the WSPS have large misclassification rates for these two categories when using many of the tabulation methods. When the distributions of the outcome variables are examined, all methods produce comparable, and relatively close matches for all health outcomes. For the AIAN unemployment rate, the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method appear to produce the least comparable results, but none of the differences is significant. There are significant differences in the AIAN labor force participation rates for several of the tabulation methods. It is likely that which method is best at matching a reference distribution for outcome measures will depend on the outcome being examined. Unfortunately, the data to assess the best tabulation method for each outcome may never be readily available. All of these conclusions should these studies. It is unclear how these responses could differ by Furthermore, most of this work samples at that. be viewed with caution. Many assumptions had to be made in people will respond to the new racial question in the future, and mode of data collection and with the subject of the survey. on developing bridging methods relied on sample data, and small  Congruence with Respondent's Choice. This criterion concerns how well the full range of the respondent's choices is represented in the racial distribution. It is more important for evaluating ongoing tabulations under the 1997 standards, but the bridging methods can be differentiated with respect to this criterion, too. None of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods takes into account the full range of the respondent's selections, but the Plurality method at least controls for the particular racial combination chosen by the respondent under the 1997 standards. The All Inclusive method accurately reflects all selections by tabulating actual responses and not people. The Equal Fraction Assignment method tabulates people, but, like the All Inclusive method, treats all responses equally. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method takes all 96   responses into account, but assignment is based on attempting to estimate in which single-race category the respondent would prefer to be counted. Range of Applicability. This criterion refers to how well the bridging method can be applied in different contexts. The All Inclusive method provides the same results in every context, because assignment does not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution. This method is not suitable for users who need a distribution that adds to 100 percent. Of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods, the Largest Group Assignment method is the least sensitive to context and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are as easy to use as the Largest Group Whole Assignment method, but the results for the small racial categories will vary to a greater extent with the context, particularly according to level of geography. The Equal Fraction Assignment method is as generalizable as the All Inclusive method, but it is not quite as easy to use. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method may be the most problematic, because they currently represent only a national preference distribution based on data from 1993 to 1995. The use of this distribution at the local level would be likely to produce inaccurate results in a number of cases. That is not to say that the other methods do not face the same problem. Meet Confidentiality and Reliability Standards. Because these methods all attempt to reproduce the racial categories under the 1977 standards, the same confidentiality problems that existed over the last 20 years will continue to exist. No increase in problems is anticipated. In the case of reliability, however, the situation is different. The All Inclusive method will not produce less reliable data than data produced under the 1977 standards. The Equal Fraction Assignment method may have reliability problems as a result of adding only fractional counts to some of the smaller categories if these categories have a high probability of being chosen as the preferred single race. The same would be true if equal fractions were used to make whole assignments. In sample surveys, the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods will have reliability problems to the extent that there is a large variance on the individual race proportions. This is likely to occur when small samples are involved. The Largest Group Whole assignment method should have the fewest problems with respect to reliability, and the Smallest Group Whole Assignment method will likely have the most. These methods have another problem, however, in that an individual's response may be assigned to different categories at different levels of geography. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method, as well as methods where fractions are used for whole assignment (i.e., the Plurality method), is based upon a sample distribution with its own variance properties. Reliability for the very small combinations will be quite bad unless many years of data are combined, and this presents its own problems. Minimize Disruptions to the Single Race Distributions. This criterion is relevant only for evaluation of bridging methods. Its purpose is to see how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the 1997 standards. To the extent 97   that a bridging method can meet the other bridging criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportions in the ongoing distribution, it will have value for looking both forward and backward in time. An evaluation of the different methods according to this criterion involves the comparison of the bridge distributions to the detailed race distribution under the 1997 standards in each case. For the CPS Supplement, the Plurality method is marginally closer than the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the Fractional methods. While the All Inclusive method and the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods match for the White category, they differ substantially from the single-race AIAN category in the detailed distribution and are marginally worse for the API category. The NHIS Fractional method is the closest in both the NHIS and WSPS. Statistically Defensible. To be statistically defensible, the bridging method must conform to acceptable statistical conventions. The All Inclusive method makes no assumption about how respondents would assign themselves in the single race situation. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method are based on an observed distribution, and, to that extent, involve less judgment than the rest of the methods that assign people and not responses. While the Equal Fractional Assignment method is based on judgment, it does not make assumptions about the relative importance of any given race. The Largest Group Whole Assignment method does assign greater importance to one of the races, but it also follows common, but different, statistical practice than the equal fraction approach. Both attempt to minimize the error in assignment. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment method and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment method do not follow statistical practice, but, instead, rely on the historical record of discrimination; even in these cases, however, the assigned category is based on an observed distribution. Ease of Use. ""Ease of use"" refers to how complicated it is to produce the bridge results. The Equal Fractional Assignment method makes assignments that do not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution at hand. It and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method do require the duplication of individual records or the creation, on every record, of a variable for each racial category under the 1977 standards in order to be able to assign fractions for any combination of categories. If the fractional methods are used to assign a respondent to a single category (whole probabilistic methods), this cumbersome process can be avoided. The All Inclusive method, like the Equal Fractional method, does not depend on the particular distribution, but it does produce proportions that add to more than 100 percent unless they are raked or recalculated to a base of 100 percent each time. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the NHIS Fractional method would require an extra step unless only national figures are used, because the relative size of the groups must be determined for each detailed distribution. Otherwise, they are as easy to use as the whole probabilistic methods. 98   Skill Required. This criterion refers to the skills required to carry out the bridge operations. The amount of computer expertise to perform the operations associated with each of these methods is fairly trivial. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods require almost no statistical knowledge. Some familiarity with the statistical adjustment literature would be useful for understanding the Deterministic Fractional Assignment procedures. If the All Inclusive method were used, users might need to understand statistical raking. Understandability and Communicability. This criterion concerns how easily the methods can be explained and understood by the average user. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are both easy to explain and easy to understand. The fractional assignment of individuals to a single category also is not difficult to follow. Assigning fractions of a person to different categories may be easy to explain, but the average user may find it difficult to accept the idea. The All Inclusive method also is easily explained, but, unless the percentages are raked to 100 percent, users may have a problem understanding how to use the results. E. Weighting When Appropriate Population Controls Are Not Available For those using the new racial categories in surveys prior to the release of new population controls from Census 2000 (expected in 2002), a method is needed to allow the use of the updated 1990 controls. The following advice is provided for researchers who find themselves in this situation: 1. 2. 3. 4. Choose a whole-allocation bridging method. Create a bridged distribution using the chosen method. Rake this bridged distribution to the 1990-based controls. Use the final weight from this process when reporting distributions for the new racial categories, including the multiple-race combinations. 5. Provide the following caveats to data users: (a) weighting was not done using controls based on the new definitions, and (b) the bridged distribution is not necessarily the same as would have been obtained using the old race question. Choosing a whole-allocation bridging method will simplify the task. Data producers should select the bridging method that they judge to be the most appropriate for their data users. Provide any available information to evaluate the likely discrepancies between the bridged distribution and the distribution that would have been obtained using the old question. Reweighting to the new controls, once they become available, is strongly recommended.  99   F. Strategies for Users This section suggests strategies for bridging that depend on the user's needs. In providing these strategies, two assumptions are made. The first is that the user is interested in the analysis of an historical data series. The second assumption follows from the first, and it is that the user will not simply be doing cross-sectional estimates of the current counts in the racial categories or the present and future characteristics of these populations. It should be noted that all of the bridging methods would require, to some extent, prior knowledge of population characteristics when working at the local level. If the user wants to examine change across the whole racial distribution, the Plurality method or one of the Fractional Allocation methods will likely provide the best approximations to the distributions from the past. They actually are based on information concerning how the respondents would have answered the question on race under the previous standards. While the new distribution should reflect only the growth in the racial categories due to population change and not methodological change, most of the other methods produce a substantial increase in the size of the American Indian and Alaska Native population not attributable to change over time. Accompanying the increase in the AIAN category is a corresponding decrease in the White category. Other distortions could occur as the size of the population identifying with more than one race grows. If the user is interested in a particular racial category, which method is chosen will depend on whether the user wants to err on the side of inclusion or exclusion, especially for the smaller racial groups. Use of the Smallest Group method or the Largest Group Other Than White method will include a substantial number of individuals that might have identified with the larger racial group in the past. The characteristics of the group might change simply as a result of their inclusion. This is particularly the case for the AIAN category, and the differences between methods with respect to inclusion or exclusion will be greatest in areas having a large AIAN population, such as the state of Washington. Analysis of the combined race/ethnicity format indicates that the choice of tabulation method has little effect on Hispanics. It should be remembered, however, that these results are based on the use of a ""manufactured"" variable and may not truly represent what would occur if an actual combined format had been used in the past. It is also the case that the AIAN category is still affected by the choice of bridging method when using the combined format. The choice of bridging method also could depend on the substantive characteristics of interest. Some characteristics may not be affected by the particular bridging method chosen. Others will show more change with one method or another. In these cases, which bridging method is used  100   will depend upon what the user is trying to discover. As noted above, health outcomes appeared not to be affected by the choice of bridging method, but economic outcomes were. Geographic characteristics also could affect the choice of bridging method. The user may have knowledge of local populations that would dictate which method should be used. For instance, the user might know that in a particular area Whites also are likely to identify as American Indian when given the opportunity, but, if forced to select a single race, they would almost certainly choose White. This knowledge might lead the user to use a bridging method that minimizes assignment to the American Indian and Alaska Native category. The fact that the Smallest Group method and the Largest Group Other Than White method give larger counts for the smaller racial groups might favor their selection in some circumstances. Reliability and confidentiality standards normally would restrict the analysis of these categories. Even though these bridging methods may produce less than ideal comparisons to the past, the larger size of the categories resulting from using these methods could increase analytical power enough to draw conclusions. Although the selection of a bridging method should be for substantive or methodological reasons, simplicity cannot be discounted altogether. Users must have both the substantive knowledge and methodological skill to use the more complicated methods. They also must be able to explain them and defend them.  101   References Benson, V. and Marano, M.

The first experiment of its kind in the United States, the Administrative Records Experiment 2000 was part of the Census 2000 Testing, Experimentation and Evaluation Program. The focus of this program was to measure the effectiveness of new techniques for decennial census enumeration. There were four evaluations: Process, Outcomes, Household, and Request for Physical Address evaluations. The first three are summarized here. Administrative Records Census definition and requirements In the Administrative Records Experiment, an administrative record census was defined as a process that relies primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, on administrative records to produce the population count and content of the decennial census short form with a strong focus on apportionment and redistricting requirements. In addition to total population counts by state, the decennial census must provide counts of the voting age (18 and over) population by race and Hispanic origin for small geographic areas, currently in the form of census blocks. Demographically, the Administrative Records Experiment provided date of birth, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Geographically, the Administrative Records Experiment operated at the level of basic street address and corresponding Census block code. Unit numbers for multi-unit dwellings were used in certain address matching operations and one of the evaluations; but generally household and family composition were not captured. The design did assume the existence of a Master Address File and geographic coding capability similar to that available for the Census 2000. The principal objectives of Administrative Records Experiment 2000 were twofold. The first objective was to develop and compare two methods for conducting an administrative records census, one that used only administrative records and a second that added some conventional support to the process in order to complete the enumeration. The second objective was to explore the potential use of administrative records data for some nonresponding or unclassified households that occur in a conventional census. Administrative Records Experiment Top-down and Bottom-up methods A two-phase process accomplished the Administrative Records Experiment 2000 enumeration. The first, or Top-down, phase involved the assembly of records from a number of national administrative record systems and unduplication of individuals within the combined systems. This was followed by computer geocoding of street addresses to the level of census block and two attempts to obtain and code physical addresses for those that would not geocode by computer. Finally, there was a selection of ""best""  ix   demographic characteristics for each individual and ""best"" street address within the experimental sites. The second phase of the Administrative Records Experiment 2000 design was an attempt to complete the administrative-records-only enumeration by the correction of errors in administrative records addresses through address verification (a coverage improvement analogue) and by adding persons missed in the administrative records (a nonresponse followup analogue). Considering the Top-down and Bottom-up processes as part of one overall design, the Administrative Records Experiment can be thought of as a prototype for a more or less conventional census with the initial mailout replaced by a Top-down administrative records enumeration. Limitations There were four principal limitations on the experiment.  The administrative records source files were limited to those used in the creation of the Statistical Administrative Records System 1999, which relied primarily on files for tax year 1998 and other files extracted early in calendar year 1999. These files neither exhausted the national-level administrative records that might have been available for Administrative Records Experiment 2000 nor were they the timeliest with respect to April 1, 2000, Census Day for Census 2000. The number of experimental sites was small. Although it would not have been reasonable or realistic to attempt to mount this first Administrative Records Experiment in a representative sample of geographic areas large enough to make national estimates, additional sites would have provided more confidence that the results were not idiosyncratic to the sites selected. There was no experimental variation in key design parameters such as the clerical and field operations and the address selection algorithm. Without some factorial or fractional factorial structure, direct estimates of operational impacts of components, individually or in combination, were not possible. The measurement of race and Hispanic origin in administrative records at the national level is deficient. Attempts were made to improve the measurement through the use of certain statistical models, but the results were not entirely satisfactory.        The limitations in the Administrative Records Experiment were largely due to resource constraints and a short planning period for what was an extremely complex and novel undertaking.  x   Experimental sites Two sites were selected that were believed to have a total of approximately one million housing units and a population of approximately two million persons. One site included Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland. The other site included Douglas, El Paso and Jefferson Counties, Colorado. The sites provided a mix of population and housing characteristics needed to assess the difficulties that might arise in conducting an administrative records census. Administrative Records Experiment Outcomes Evaluation As expected, the Bottom-up coverage is much improved compared to the Top-down, and this is largely due to the completion of the Top-down enumeration by using census data for nonmatched addresses, which simulates a followup to the administrative records enumeration. Specifically, the Bottom-up coverage of children (81 percent - 94 percent across the test sites) is substantially better than the Top-down (72 percent - 83 percent). Coverage of children is a particular weakness for administrative records used in Administrative Records Experiment 2000. Adults in the Bottom-up are more or less uniformly overcounted (102 percent - 104 percent). The overcount of adults most likely is due to unaccounted for deaths in the 12 months prior to Census Day, the lack of special populations operations in the Administrative Records Experiment (e.g., a group quarters enumeration), and failure to unduplicate persons after adding census data for nonmatched addresses. Of course, the latter means that there is some duplication of children as well. Detailed enumeration results focused mainly on a comparison of the Bottom-up enumeration with the Census 2000. The analysis did not include group quarters and, due to limitations in the administrative records sources, persons could not be reported with ""multi"" or ""other"" race. The analysis progressed from large geographic areas to small geographic areas, beginning with the five test site counties and ending with census blocks within the sites. The evaluation incorporated a variety of methods to accomplish its objectives, including univariate and multivariate statistical analyses of the Administrative Records Experiment/Census 2000 differences, and spatial/ecological maps that examined the geographic distributions of key comparison measures. The outcomes evaluation tried to disentangle the influence of demographic change and Administrative Records Experiment processing, coverage and data quality issues, while presenting basic enumeration statistics. At the county level, the Bottom-up process undercounted total population in all sites except Baltimore City. As with the total population, males and females were undercounted in all sites except Baltimore City, but the female undercounts were slightly greater than male undercounts. Age groups showed more variability with most groups undercounted. Generally the size of the undercounts increased with decreasing age, except for the 20-24 age group. These patterns did not appear to be site-specific. Overcounts for the oldest old and undercounts for the youngest persons suggest that  xi   much more timely birth and death information must be obtained. Also, the special enumeration requirements for populations such as college students, the military and persons in nursing homes must be incorporated into administrative records processes. Administrative records are not currently a good source of data for race and Hispanic origin, and the models were not sufficient to correct their deficiencies. Blacks and Hispanics were undercounted when they were a large minority group and overcounted when they were not. American Indians and Alaskan natives were not well identified and the accuracy of Asian/Pacific Islander counts was uncertain. Bottom-up tract-level total population results indicated a good correspondence between Administrative Records Experiment and the census. The population counts of 70 percent of tracts were within 5 percent points, and 95 percent of the tracts were within 25 percentage points, though a sizable number of tracts had moderate and large undercounts. At the block-level, population counts were the least accurate. For the total population 38 percent of blocks met the 5 percent criterion and about 85 percent of blocks met the 25 percent criterion. A multivariate analysis of block differences showed that large undercounts were associated with such block characteristics as high population density, high rental rates, and large proportions of persons age 20-24. Large overcounts were associated with high vacancy rates, low population density, small proportions of persons under the age of 20 and large proportions of persons age 20-24 and age 65 and over (Heimovitz, 2002). Administrative Records Experiment Household-level analysis The general goal of the household-level analysis was to assess how well households formed from administrative records matched those from Census 2000 addresses. The evaluation focused, first, on the factors associated with Administrative Records Experiment and Census 2000 addresses that were (computer) linked. Then, demographic comparisons were made between households at linked addresses. There was a special focus on Census 2000 households that required a nonresponse followup and Census 2000 unclassified (imputed) households. The evaluation used both descriptive analyses and logistic regression analysis to assess the coverage and accuracy of Administrative Records Experiment households. Descriptive analyses were performed for households in all five Administrative Records Experiment counties and for the Census 2000 nonresponse followup and imputed households in the test sites. A logistic regression model was developed to predict the probability of an accurate household match using address and Administrative Records Experiment processing characteristics as predictors. Addresses with a high probability of correct demographic match between occupants might be candidates for administrative records substitution in the case of nonresponse followup in a conventional census. In the following discussion the term ""linked"" is used to mean a matched address. The term ""matched"" is reserved for household demographic comparisons at linked addresses.  xii   Administrative Records Experiment's coverage of the census nonresponse followup universe was not as good as its coverage of the overall universe. Administrative Records Experiment housing units were linked with 70.9 percent of the census nonresponse followup housing units, compared with 88.4 percent of the census responding housing units. For occupied nonresponse followup housing units, the coverage rate was 76.7 percent. The Administrative Records Experiment housing units were linked with 63.2 percent of households that were imputed to have people in them, and 34.7 percent of those imputed to be vacant. The Administrative Records Experiment and the census counted the same number of people in the housing unit for 51.1 percent of the 889,638 linked households, and Administrative Records Experiment was within one of the census for 79.4 percent of the units. The 51.1 percent is effectively a ceiling on the percent of linked households that had exactly the same persons from Administrative Records Experiment and Census 2000. Although errors in address linkage would account for some of the mismatched households, the deficiencies in administrative records cited earlier in this report--missing children, lack of special population operations and the time gap between the administrative records extracts and Census Day--most likely account for the major part. For linked nonresponse followup housing units, Administrative Records Experiment had the same numbers of persons for 37.0 percent of the units and was within one 69.3 percent of the time. Census 2000 nonresponse followup housing units were more susceptible to the Administrative Records Experiment deficiencies than responding units. In addition, enumeration errors in Census 2000 might have been higher for these units. The regression analysis demonstrated a number of factors associated with greater probability of matched household demographics. These include: single unit address rather than multi-unit, household with only one or two members, all household occupants over the age of 65, at least one White occupant, no occupant with imputed race in the Administrative Records Experiment. The predictive power of the model was moderately strong. At a predicted probability of 0.5 or higher, the probability of a correct household match was about 72 percent. At a predicted probability of 0.8 or higher, the probability of a correct match increased to about 83 percent, but the proportion of addresses with predicted probability this high was only about 4 percent of all addresses. Evidently, the limitations in the data, particularly the administrative records cutoffs and poor race and Hispanic origin measurement, made household prediction quite difficult. Implications for 2010 Planning Substitution for 2010 nonresponse followup households should continue to be explored Although the results of the household-level analysis were not definitive due to the limitations on Administrative Records Experiment 2000, they were sufficiently strong that research into the substitution of administrative records households for nonresponse followup or unclassified households in a conventional census should continue. For  xiii   nonresponse followup households there is the potential for significant cost savings, and for unclassified households, the potential for greater accuracy than that provided by imputation. The approach piloted in the Administrative Records Experiment 2000 should be tested as part of the 2004 Census Test using models developed from a linkage of Statistical Administrative Records System 2000 data to the Census 2000 files. The timing of the administrative records in the Statistical Administrative Records System 2000 would be much closer to Census Day than the Statistical Administrative Records System 1999 data used in the Administrative Records Experiment 2000, and much more like the data that could be acquired for 2010. Other 2010 impacts should be considered There are other aspects of 2010 Census development in which administrative records might play a role. These include Master Address File improvements, development and testing of unduplication methods for 2010, subnational Demographic Analysis, and coverage measurement research. 2010 data acquisition and research agenda Arrangements should be made to acquire administrative records on a timelier basis and to obtain some data sets that might fill some of the administrative records coverage gaps. A research agenda for 2010 would include:          Additional evaluation of the impact of clerical and field operations in Administrative Records Experiment 2000. Person unduplication in the Administrative Records Experiment Bottom-up process. Repeating Administrative Records Experiment 2000 with Statistical Administrative Records System 2000 data. Repeating the Household-level analysis using Statistical Administrative Records System 2000 data. Analysis of administrative records coverage gaps, in particular gaps related to persons in group quarters. Master Address File improvements using administrative records. Improving address linkage techniques. Enhancing Numident race and Hispanic origin data using Census 2000. Contributing to subnational Demographic Analysis.  xiv   Implications for other Census Bureau programs The research that went into the development of the Statistical Administrative Records System and Administrative Records Experiment 2000 has had significant payoffs in Census programs other than the decennial census, and the development of new uses for administrative records should continue to benefit non-decennial programs in the future. There have been huge gains in knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of national administrative records systems to support various Census Bureau activities, in the capacity for large scale data processing, data standardization, record linkage, file unduplicaton, and Social Security Number search and verification that will have benefits throughout the Census Bureau. Research agenda for other Census Bureau programs A research agenda for other Census Bureau programs could include:      Testing the use of Statistical Administrative Records System as a contributor to total population and age/race/sex/Hispanic origin intercensal estimates. Testing the use of Statistical Administrative Records System data for improving noninterview weights in ongoing surveys. Testing the use of Statistical Administrative Records System as a tool to support small area income and poverty estimates. Continuing to test the use of Administrative Records databases for Social Security Number validation and search strategies. Continuing to improve our record linkage capabilities (for example, linking Current Population Survey addresses and persons to comparable Decennial Census addresses and persons), both in terms of improvements and search strategy improvements.  xv   Intentionally Blank  xvi   1. 1.1 Introduction  BACKGROUND  The Administrative Records Experiment 2000 (AREX 2000) was an experiment in two areas of the country designed to gain information regarding the feasibility of conducting an administrative records census (ARC), or the use of administrative records in support of conventional decennial census processes. The first experiment of its kind, AREX 2000 was part of the Census 2000 Testing, Experimentation, and Evaluation Program. The focus of this program was to measure the effectiveness of new techniques, methodologies, and technologies for decennial census enumeration. Interest in taking a decennial census by administrative records dates back at least as far as a proposal by Alvey and Scheuren (1982) wherein records from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) along with those of several other agencies might form the core of an administrative records census. Knott (1991) identified two basic ARC models: (1) the Top-down model that assembles administrative records from a number of sources, unduplicates them, assigns geographic codes, and counts the results; and (2) the Bottomup model that matches administrative records to a master address file, fills the addresses with individuals, resolves gaps and inconsistencies address by address, and counts the results. There have been a number of other calls for ARC research -- see for example Myrskyla 1991; Myrskyla, Taeuber and Knott 1996; Czajka, Moreno and Shirm 1997; Bye 1997. All of the proposals fit either the Top-down or Bottom-up model described here. Knott also suggested a composite Top-down/Bottom-up model that would unduplicate administrative records using the Social Security Number (SSN), then match the address file, and proceed as in the Bottom-up approach. In overall concept, AREX 2000 most closely resembles this composite approach. More recently, direct use of administrative records in support of decennial applications was cited in several proposals during the Census 2000 debates on sampling for Nonresponse Followup (NRFU). The proposals ranged from direct substitution of administrative data for non-responding households (Zanutto, 1996; Zanutto and Zaslavsky, 1996; 1997; 2001) to augmenting the Master Address File development process with U.S. Postal Service address lists (Edmonston and Schultze, 1995:103). AREX 2000 provided the opportunity to explore the possibility of NRFU support. The Administrative Records Research (ARR) staff of the Planning, Research, and Evaluation Division (PRED) performed the majority of coordination, design, file handling, and certain field operations of the experiment. Various other divisions within the Census Bureau, including Field Division, Decennial Systems and Contracts Management Office, Population Division, and Geography Division supported the ARRS staff. Throughout this report, rather than identifying individual workgroups or teams, we shall refer to the operational decisions made in support of AREX to be those of ARRS; that is,  1   we shall say that ""ARRS decided to..."" whenever a key operational decision is described, even though, of course, ARRS were not the only decision makers.  1.2 Administrative Record Census--Definition and Requirements In the AREX, an administrative record census was defined as a process that relies primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, on administrative records to produce the population counts and content of the decennial census short form with a strong focus on apportionment and redistricting requirements. Title 13, United States Code, directs the Census Bureau to provide state population counts to the President for the apportionment of Congressional seats within nine months of Census Day. In addition to total population counts by state, the decennial census must provide counts of the voting age population (18 and over) by race and Hispanic origin for small geographic areas, currently in the form of Census blocks, as prescribed by PL 94-171 (1975) and the Voting Rights Act (1964). These data are used to construct and evaluate state and local legislative districts. Demographically, the AREX provided date of birth, race, Hispanic origin, and sex, although the latter is not required for apportionment or redistricting purposes. Geographically, the AREX operated at the level of basic street address and corresponding Census block code. Unit numbers for multi-unit dwellings were used in certain address matching operations and one of the evaluations; but generally, household and family composition were not captured. In addition, the design did not provide for the collection of sample long form population or housing data, needs that will presumably be met in the future by the American Community Survey program. The design did assume the existence of a Master Address File and geographic coding capability similar to that available for Census 2000.  1.3 AREX Objectives The principal objectives of AREX 2000 were twofold. The first objective was to develop and compare two methods for conducting an administrative records census, one that used only administrative records and a second that added some conventional support to the process in order to complete the enumeration. The evaluation of the results also included a comparison to Census 2000 results in the experimental sites. The second objective was to test the potential use of administrative records data for some part of the NRFU universe, or for the unclassified universe. Addresses that fall into the unclassified status have very limited information on them--so limited, in fact, that the address occupancy status must be imputed, and, conditional on being imputed ""occupied,"" the entire household, including characteristics, must be imputed. In order to effectively use administrative records databases for substitution purposes; one must determine which kinds of administrative record households are most likely to yield similar demographic distributions to their corresponding census households. Other more general objectives of the AREX included the collection of relevant information, available only in 2000, to support ongoing research and planning for administrative records use in the 2010 Census, and the comparison of an administrative  2   records census to other potential 2010 methodologies. These evaluations and other data will provide assistance in planning major components of future decennial censuses, particularly those that have administrative records as their primary source of data.  1.4 AREX Top-down and Bottom-up Methods Top-down A two-phase process accomplished the AREX 2000 enumeration. The first phase involved the assembly and computer geocoding of records from a number of national administrative record systems, and unduplication of individuals within the combined systems. This was followed by two attempts to obtain and code physical addresses (clerical geocoding and request for physical address) for those that would not geocode by computer. Finally, there was a selection of ""best"" demographic characteristics for each individual and ""best"" street address within the experimental sites. Much of the computer processing for this phase was performed as part of the Statistical Administrative Records System (StARS) 1999 processing (Judson, 2000; Farber and Leggieri, 2002). As such, StARS 1999 was an integral part of AREX 2000 design. One can think about the results of the Top-down process in two ways. First, counting the population at this point provides, in effect, an administrative-records-only census. That is, the enumeration includes only those individuals found in the administrative records, and there is no other support for the census outside of activities related to geocoding. AREX 2000 provides population counts from the Top-down phase so that the efficacy of an administrative-records-only census can be assessed. However, one might expect an enumeration that used only administrative records to be substantially incomplete. Therefore, a second way to think about the Top-down process is as a substitute for an initial mailout in the context of a more conventional census that would include additional support for the enumeration. Bottom-up The fundamental difference between the Bottom-up method and the Top-down method is the Bottom-up method matches administrative records addresses to a separately developed ""frame"" of addresses, and based on this match, performs additional operations. In this experiment, an extract of the Census Bureau's Master Address File (MAF) served as the frame1. The second phase of the AREX 2000 design was an attempt to complete the administrative-records-only enumeration by the correction of errors in administrative records addresses through address verification (a coverage improvement analogue) and by adding persons missed in the administrative records (a NRFU analogue). This phase began by matching the addresses found in the Top-down process to the MAF in order to  1  In this report, we use the term ""MAF"" generically. Our operations were based on extracts from the Decennial Master Address File (DMAF).  3   assess their validity and to identify those MAF addresses for which no administrative records were found. A field address review (FAV) was used to verify non-matched administrative records addresses, and invalid administrative records addresses were excluded from the Bottom-up selection of best address. In design, non-matched MAF addresses would be canvassed in order to enumerate persons at addresses not found in the administrative records systems. In the AREX, such a canvassing was simulated by adding those persons found in the Census 2000 at the unmatched addresses to the adjusted administrative-records-only counts, thus completing the enumeration. Accomplishing the AREX as part of the Census 2000 obviated the need to mount a separate field operation to canvass unmatched MAF addresses. Considering the Top-down and Bottom-up processes as part of one overall design, AREX can be thought of as a prototype for a more or less conventional census with the initial mailout replaced by a Top-down administrative records enumeration. Figure 1 below, provides a conceptual overview of the experiment for enumerating the population tested during the AREX. A more detailed description of data processing flows can be found in Attachment 1. The graphical description presented here is intended to convey the concept of both AREX methods when viewed in terms of the Bottom-up method as a follow-on process to the Top-down method.  4   Figure 1.

Two sites were selected believed to have approximately one million housing units and a population of approximately two million persons. One site included Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland. The other site included Douglas, El Paso, and Jefferson Counties, Colorado. The sites provided a mix of characteristics needed to assess the difficulties that might arise in conducting an administrative records census. Approximately one half of the test housing units was selected based on criteria assumed to be easy-to-capture in an administrative records census (for example, areas having a preponderance of city style addresses, single family  5   housing units, older and less mobile populations), and the other half was selected based on criteria assumed to be hard to capture (the converse).  1.6 AREX Source Files The administrative records for AREX were drawn from the StARS 1999 database. There were six national-level source files selected for inclusion in StARS. A later section of this document describes the source files in detail. The files were chosen to provide the broadest coverage possible of the U.S. population, and to compensate for the weaknesses or lack of coverage of a given segment of the population inherent in any one-source file. See Section 2 for a description of the source file characteristics. Timing An important limitation for the AREX is the gap between the reference period for data contained in each source file and the point-in-time reference of April 1, 2000 for the Census. The time lag has an impact on both population coverage--births, deaths, immigration and emigration--and geographic location--housing extant, and geographic mobility. As an example, both IRS files include data for tax year 1998 with an expected current address as of tax filing time close to April 15, 1999. Note, however, that the IRS 1040 file only provided persons in the tax unit as of December 31, 1998. The pertinent reference dates for each of the files are provided in Section 2. State, Local and Commercial Files ARRS decided not to use state and local files2 and commercially available databases3 in the AREX 2000 experiment. Statistical evidence is limited, but various reports from ARRS indicated that state and local files come in an extremely diverse variety of forms, with equally diverse record layouts and content (for historical information, see Sweet, 1997; Buser, Huang, Kim, and Marquis, 1998; and other papers in the Administrative Records Memorandum Series). Furthermore, ARRS reported that it was quite timeconsuming and intricate to develop the interagency contractual arrangements necessary to use state and local files. Public opinion results such as Singer and Miller (1992), Aguirre International (1995), and Gellman (1997), convinced ARRS that public sensitivity to the idea of linking commercial databases with government databases (other than for address processing) would be too great, and that such a linkage would be unwise. Census Numident An additional, and critical, file used in creation of the StARS database was the Census Numident file. For the AREX, it was the source of most of the demographic characteristics and some of the death data. Detailed discussion regarding the creation and use of the Census Numident may also be found in Section 2. 2  Such as state and local tax returns, drivers license files, local utilities, assessor's records, and the like. Such as commercially available mailing lists, credit card databases, and the like.  3  6   1.7 AREX Evaluations This report is a consolidation of four evaluations of AREX 2000 that have been prepared by ARRS staff. The Process Evaluation (Berning and Cook, 2002) documents and analyzes selected components or processes of the Top-down and Bottom-up methods in order to identify errors or deficiencies. It is designed to catalogue the various processes by which raw administrative data became final AREX counts and attempts to identify the relative contributions of these various processes. The Request for Physical Address (RFPA) Evaluation (Berning, 2002) assesses the impact of noncity-style addresses. These addresses present a significant hurdle to the use of an administrative records census on either a supplemental or substitution basis. A particular problem is the determination of residential addresses and their associated geographic block level allocation for individuals whose administrative record address is a P.O. Box or Rural Route. The Outcomes Evaluation (Heimovitz, 2002) is a comparison of Top-down and Bottomup AREX counts by county, tract, and block level counts of the total population by race, Hispanic origin, age groups and gender, with comparable decennial census counts. This evaluation is outcome rather than process oriented. The Household Evaluation (Judson and Bauder, 2002) focuses on household-level comparisons between administrative records and Census 2000. It assesses the potential for NRFU substitution and unclassified imputations, and predictive capability.  1.8 Limitations of the Experiment In order to achieve a full understanding of the AREX processes and outcomes, it is important to appreciate the context within which the experiment was carried out. The AREX was the first attempt by the Census Bureau to experiment with the use of administrative records as the foundation of a short form decennial census. Planning for the experiment did not begin until the end of 1997, which was quite late in the Census 2000 development cycle for an experiment of such complexity. The resources for the experiment were limited to a part of the Administrative Records Research Staff (ARRS) in the Planning, Research, and Evaluation Division (PRED) with the help of other decennial census staff. Administrative records source files A consequence of the short planning time and limited resources was a number of design and operational decisions that made the AREX 2000 enumeration process quite different from the way such an enumeration might be carried out if administrative records were to be used in some future decennial census. Chief among these differences was the decision to use StARS 1999, the national administrative records database developed by ARRS, as  7   the source of the administrative records for the experiment. The administrative records source files for StARS 1999 neither exhausted the national-level administrative records that might have been available for AREX 2000 nor were they the timeliest. To cover the population, StARS 1999 relied primarily on tax records for 1998 received by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in calendar year 1999. While IRS tax records would have to be the core of any national administrative records database, the coverage deficiencies are well known--adults without tax documents, children of taxpayers with more than four dependents, and children of adults who did not have to file 1040 income tax returns. With additional time, more could have been done to obtain administrative records from Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that might have filled these coverage gaps. However, the acquisition of data from Federal agencies is a difficult, time consuming, and sometimes expensive process involving negotiations, interagency agreements, data extract specifications, and testing and validation of the delivered products before such data can be included in a national data base. Obtaining timelier data for the AREX 2000 would have required, in some cases, the receipt of data on a flow basis from the source agencies. Receipt of tax forms filed in calendar year 2000, would have required obtaining 1040 data from IRS on a flow basis and possibly 1099 and W-2 data from SSA as well. (See Section 2 for a discussion of the sources and timing of tax data.) Also, more timely extracts might have been obtained from other contributing agencies had there been sufficient time to make the arrangements. As will be evident in this report, the fact that the reference period for the administrative data was one or more years behind census day (April 1, 2000) was the single most important limitation to the AREX goal of testing the completeness and accuracy of an administrative records census. Using timely administrative records data in a decennial census implies large administrative records data processing operations would be done quickly as part of the decennial enumeration. One thing learned from AREX 2000 is that such processing is technically feasible and could be accomplished with the planning time and resources that would be available for actual census operations as opposed to those typically available for small experiments. Two experimental sites A second major limitation imposed by lack of planning time and resources was the restriction of the experiment to five counties in two states. Although it would not have been reasonable or realistic to attempt to mount this first AREX in a representative sample of geographic areas large enough to make national estimates, additional sites would have provided more confidence that the results could be generalized beyond the sites selected. While there is much to be learned from the AREX, it is important to keep in mind that for the AREX results, descriptive statistics are generally only representative of the test sites themselves; and the modeling results, though suggestive of the relationships between administrative records outcomes and their covariates, are not definitive.  8   Lack of experimental variation of key design parameters There were several AREX operations relating to address processing that could have been more thoroughly evaluated with some additional structure in the experimental design. These operations involved clerical and field attempts to validate addresses and obtain block-level geocodes, clerical support for addressing matching of administrative records to the Master Address File, and the ""best address"" selection algorithm for the administrative records. In all cases, the objective of the evaluation would have been to assess the impact of the particular operation or algorithm on final address selection and ultimately whether the operation contributed significantly to the accuracy of the AREX enumeration. Evaluation of the clerical and field operations, individually or in combination, would be important because they represent potential costly components were they to be implemented as part of a national administrative records census. Evaluation of the address selection algorithm would have revealed the impact of the preference of geocoded addresses over others in the algorithm. Unfortunately, the experimental design did not include factorial or fractional factorial structure permitting direct estimates of the impact of operational components, individually or in combination. Race and Hispanic origin models Population tallies by race and Hispanic origin are a crucial product of the short form census because of their use in drawing and evaluating political districts at and below the state level. Measurement of race and Hispanic origin is a major weakness of administrative records at the national level and any attempt to use administrative records to enumerate all or part of the population would have to find some way of improving the information available in administrative records. In his design proposal for an administrative record census in 2010, Bye (1997) suggested building a list of SSNs annotated by race and Hispanic origin by a series of operations that would begin by matching Census 2000 to SSA's Numident and continue during the years leading up to the 2010 Census. (See also Bye and Thompson (1999). Sections 4 and 5 of this report describe activities currently underway at the Census Bureau.) Had more planning time and resources been available to the AREX, it might have been possible to incorporate race roster building into the experiment by including one or more of the 1995 and 1996 census test sites or Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal sites in the AREX (Bye, 1997). However, such race roster building was not available to the AREX, and ARRS decided to use Numident-based national-level models to augment the race and Hispanic origin data (Bye 1998). Although using the models generally worked in aggregate counts, the use of national-level models to impute characteristics of small geographic areas has certain well-known weaknesses in that the actual findings in the smaller areas can vary substantially around the national predictions. Bye (1998) provided tabulations for states and some substate areas showing the kind of variation that could be expected when using the national models for the AREX. Bye and Thompson (1999) provided a partial solution to this problem, but an annotated Numident file is clearly a superior solution.  9   2. 2.1 Introduction  THE AREX PROCESS EVALUATION  This section describes and evaluates the AREX enumeration processes. The process description is taken largely from the process evaluation report of Berning and Cook (2002). In this report, process descriptions have been provided separately for the Topdown and Bottom-up enumerations. The actual data processing flows were often intermingled and are provided by Berning and Cook in great detail. Concerning process evaluation, Berning and Cook focused mainly on data processing and clerical operations. Administrative records AREX source files  The administrative records for AREX were drawn from the StARS 1999 database. The six national-level source files selected for StARS were chosen to provide the broadest coverage possible of the U.S. population. At a minimum, the files had to have for each record, a name, Social Security Number (SSN), and street address. The national level files that contributed to the StARS 1999 database and therefore to AREX 2000, were: Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Tax Year 1998 Individual Master File (IMF 1040), IRS Tax Year 1998 Information Returns Master File (IRMF W-2 / 1099), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 1999 Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) File, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 1999 Medicare Enrollment Database (MEDB) File, Indian Health Services (IHS) 1999 Patient Registration System File, and Selective Service System (SSS) 1999 Registration File.  The following table displays the primary reason each file was included in the StARS database and the approximate number of input records associated with each.  10   Table 1. Source File Characteristics File Targeted Population Segment Taxpayer and other members of the reporting unit with current address Persons with taxable income who might not have filed tax returns Low income housing population (possible non-taxpayers) Elderly population (possible non-taxpayers) Native American population (possible nontaxpayers) Young male population (possible nontaxpayers) Total ~ # of Address Records 120 million 598 million 3.3 million 57 million 3.1 million 14.4 million 795 million ~ # of Person Records 243 million 556 million 3.3 million 57 million 3.1 million 13.1 million 875 million  IRS 1040 IRS W2/1099 HUD TRACS Medicare File IHS File SSS File  Notes: The variance between the number of address records and person records within the input source files is a result of the following source file characteristics:  1. Each IRS 1040 input record may reflect up to six persons (primary filer, secondary, and dependents).  2. Each SSS input record may reflect two addresses - defined as current and/or permanent address. 3. The IRS W-2/1099 file undergoes a preliminary unduplication and clean-up process prior to the initial file edit process.  Timing An important limitation for the AREX was the gap between the reference period for data contained in each source file and the point-in-time reference of April 1, 2000 for the Census. The gap had an impact on both population coverage (births, deaths, immigration and emigration) and geographic location (housing extant, and geographic mobility). As an example, the IRS 1040 file included data for tax year 1998 with an expected current address as of tax filing time close to April 15, 1999, but provided only persons in the tax unit as of December 31, 1998.  11   The following table displays the reference periods of the files available. Generally, the reference periods are about one year prior to the day of Census 2000. Table 2. Reference Dates of Source Files Source File Indian Health Service Selective Service HUD TRACS Medicare IRS 1040 IRS W-2 / 1099 Notes: 1. File Cut date is for posting cycle weeks 1-39 only for IRS 1040, and weeks 1-41 for IRS 1099 files. Weeks 40-52 (and 42-52 respectively) were not included in StARS '99. This file reflects the most current address on file for the taxpayer. It could be an address that has been updated since the 1998 tax return was posted. 2. Cut-off date is same as dates used to define universe: persons born after April 2, 1972 and on (or before) April 1, 1980. 3. Universe also defined as persons with a death date of 12/31/1989 or later.

For the AREX, it was the source of most of the demographic characteristics and some of the death data. The Census Numident was created by ARRS for the primary purpose of validating Social Security Numbers (SSNs) used in the processing of administrative records and supplying demographic variables missing from source files. The Census Numident is an edited version of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Numerical Identification (Numident) File. The SSA Numident file is the numerically ordered master file of  12   assigned Social Security Numbers (SSN) that may contain up to 300 entries for each SSN record, although on average contains two records per SSN. Each entry represents an initial application for a SSN or an addition or change (referred to as a transaction) to the information pertaining to a given SSN. The SSA Numident contains all transactions (and therefore, multiple entries) ever recorded against a single SSN. The SSA Numident available for StARS 1999 reflected all transactions through December 1998. The Census Numident was designed to collapse the SSA Numident entries to reflect ""one best record"" for each SSN containing the ""best"" demographic data for each SSN on the file. Following edit, unduplication, and selection of best demographics, the SSA Numident file of nearly 677 million records was reduced to just over 396 million records that comprise the Census Numident file.  2.2 Top-down enumeration Dual stream process  The goal of the Top-down process was to use administrative records to identify individuals residing at geocoded addresses in the AREX test sites and to construct a data record for each individual that contained demographic data (age, gender, race and Hispanic origin) corresponding as closely as possible to census short form data. To achieve this goal, a ""dual-stream"" processing approach was adopted. One processing stream concerned the development of a unique record for each individual with best demographics. The second stream involved development of an unduplicated set of addresses, geocoded to the block level. In the end, persons and addresses were brought together, and a best address was selected for each person to complete the Top-down enumeration. The following sections provide a brief description of the AREX Top-down data processing steps. Much of the work was accomplished in the development of StARS 1999 itself, but there were some differences in demographic and address selection rules. More detail is given in Berning and Cook (2002). Top-down Person processing consisted of three main steps. 1. File edits for person data, 2. SSN Verification of person records, 3. Unduplication of person records, and creation of the Person Characteristics File (PCF) that contained the ""best"" demographic characteristics for each person record.  13   Models were used to generate ""best"" demographic characteristics. Details about the models can be found in Bye (1998, race/Hispanic origin)4, and Thompson (1999, gender)5. In general, a person's modeled race or gender was used only in the case where no race appeared on any administrative record, including the Numident. In the case of gender, the model was rarely used since the Numident reported gender more than 99 percent of the time. For Race, the model was used when the Numident race was shown as ""Other"" or ""Unknown"" or ""Hispanic,"" and no other administrative record provided it. The vast majority of cases with unknown race were either children whose applications for SSNs were processed via SSA's enumeration-at-birth program, which was started in the mid-1980s, or older persons who had applied for Social Security benefits prior to SSA's development of the electronic Numident in the mid-1970s. For Hispanic Origin, the model was used for all cases for which neither the Numident nor any of the other administrative records indicated Hispanic origin. Because the Numident did not capture Hispanic origin prior to 1980, the model was used for well over 90 percent of the cases. The following table shows the extent of Race and Hispanic Origin imputation for the individuals included in the Top-down AREX enumeration. Table 3. Percent of cases with imputed Race or Hispanic Origin by age and County Imputed Race County <18 18 and over Imputed Hispanic Origin <18 18 and over  Baltimore City Baltimore County Douglas, CO El Paso, CO Jefferson, CO  40.7 49.3 58.2 52.2 54.8  2.8 4.0 6.0 9.0 8.0  99.4 99.2 98.3 93.9 94.7  96.7 98.5 97.7 93.9 95.2  4 The Race and Hispanic Origin models were developed using Numident data and Spanish and Asian name lists. The principal variables in the prediction equations were: (1) race or Hispanic origin as it appeared in the Numident, (2) place of birth, (3) Spanish and Asian surname indicators for the SSN holder and parents' surnames, and (4) indicator field in the Indian Health Service file. The Race and Hispanic Origin models were originally developed to augment race and Hispanic origin information in the Numident. 5 The gender model was based on the strength of association between first and middle names and reported sex. Look-up tables created for common names, uncommon names, name-gender proportions, and gender model parameters were created and a final gender probability assigned after the four look-up tables were created and run against each input record.  14   Top-down Address Processing  Top-down Address Processing consisted of four main steps. 1. 2. 3. 4. File edits for address data. Code-1 processing and computer geocoding the address records. Manual geocoding for addresses not coded by computer. Creation of Master Housing File for administrative record addresses.  The creation of the Master Housing File for administrative record addresses was the final step in the address processing before the addresses were relinked with the person records. This step had two main objectives. First there was an attempt to identify commercial addresses in the files. Second, there was a final attempt to unduplicate the addresses prior to the application of address selection rules. Table 4. StARS 1999 and AREX Test Site Geocoding Tallies # Input Records to Geocoding StARS National Address File Maryland subset of StARS National File Colorado subset of StARS National File # of Records Geocoded Percent Geocoded 73.3  147,346,145 108,032,169  725,108  626,247  86.4  624,248  498,783  79.9  Clerical Geocoding and Request for Physical Address (RFPA)  Addresses that cannot be geocoded by computer generally fall into three categories: (1) city style addresses; (2) P.O. Box and non-city style addresses (rural route/box number); or (3) addresses that are so fragmented that they cannot be classified. Procedures for attempting to obtain geocodes for the first two classes of addresses are described below. Seriously fragmented addresses are discarded at this point. Master Address File Geocoding Office Resolution (MAFGOR) MAFGOR was an existing operational capability within the Regional Census Centers (RCC) to provide clerical geocoding for the Decennial Master Address File as part of  15   Census 2000. Addresses identified by ZIP code as being potentially in the AREX sites but not geocoded by computer were sent to the Philadelphia RCC (79,307) and the Denver RCC (83,841). These two RCCs attempted to clerically geocode these addresses using trained staff, reference materials, and maps. The clerical geocoding added about 3 percent to the total number of addresses coded. Request for Physical Address (RFPA) P.O. Box and rural route/box number addresses pose a special challenge for geocoding. The P.O. Box address does not refer to a physical location and the non-city style addresses often do not precisely identify the housing unit location. The RFPA was an attempt to collect physical addresses (house number and street name) for persons receiving mail at these potential test site addresses. Major components of the operation were to:     Create an address file from administrative records where the mailing address was a Post Office Box or noncity-style address. Design and mail a form requesting physical address information. Have the RCCs attempt to clerically geocode the physical addresses of the returned forms to state, county and block. Key addresses and geocode information to a file for further analysis.  The mailing was sent to 58,151 addresses associated with 138,653 individuals. For a number of reasons, the response rate to the mailout was only about 20 percent of which about 86 percent (9,431 physical addresses) were geocoded, 8,090 to an AREX test site county. The coded addresses were to have been added to the address lists prior to AREX address selection. However, because of the small number of persons that would have been potentially added to the enumeration or for whom addresses might have changed, these addresses were not incorporated into the AREX address file. As indicated above, the RFPA was the subject of a special evaluation. More can be found in Berning (2002). Table 5 provides a summary of Top-down address coding. Note that only about 3,000 addresses were too fragmented to be eligible for either MAFGOR or RFPA.  16   Table 5.

AREX Top-down composite person records (CPR)  At this point in the AREX ""dual stream"" process, address and person data were brought together in preparation for creation of the Composite Person record. There were two principal tasks. First, individuals potentially in the AREX test sites were identified. Then, the best address was selected for these persons. If the best address was in the test site, then the individual became part of the Top-down enumeration. The development of the AREX person universe began with the national databases of persons and addresses described in the previous sections. First, all persons ever associated with an AREX address were included in a file of potential AREX persons. Next, all of the addresses associated with these persons--addresses both in and outside of the test site--were assembled and subjected to the following selection algorithm.     Select Select Select Select geocoded addresses over non-geocoded addresses. the highest HUID category available. a non-proxy address over an address with a proxy. a non-commercial address over a commercial address.  17     Select the address based on source file priority as follows:  IRS 1040 record  Medicare record  Indian Health Service record  IRS 1099 record  Selective Service record  HUD TRACs record  Select the most recent record based on the administrative record cycle dates.  Select the first record read-in to the processing array for output to the CPR. If the best address for any person record from among the AREX person universe file was determined not to be within the AREX test site, the person record was flagged ""out of scope"" to ensure the person was not counted in the population tallies for the AREX test site.  Top-down process results  The composite person record represents the completion of the Top-down process for the AREX 2000 experiment. Prior to tabulation, a final match of the AREX addresses was made to the Decennial Master Address File (DMAF) for the purpose of transforming the collection geography to tabulation geography6. Because the AREX addresses were initially geocoded to collection geography, it was necessary to translate the collection geographic codes into the tabulation geographic codes so that the comparisons to Census 2000 tabulations could be made. The tallies for the top down method are shown in the following table.  6 The taking of the census spans approximately a two year period, including the address list building phase. The geographic framework going into the census is called collection geography. Prior to tabulation of the final Census counts, changes must be incorporated to reflect boundaries in effect on January 1, 1999. This final geographic framework is called ""tabulation"" geography.  18   Table 6.

Generally, administrative records undercounted the population; but coverage of adults (89 percent - 96 percent) was much better than children (72 percent - 83 percent). There is an evaluation of the administrative records data sources and Top-down processing tasks in Bye 2002.  2.3 Bottom-up enumeration The weaknesses of the Top-down process as exhibited above were not unexpected. In fact, most historical proposals for an administrative records census recognized that  19   additional operations, beyond tallies of administrative records, would have to be performed for a complete enumeration to be obtained. The Bottom-up phase of the AREX 2000 design was an attempt to complete the administrative-records-only enumeration by adding persons missed in the administrative records, a process analogous to a conventional nonresponse followup (NRFU). There was also an attempt to correct Top-down enumeration errors by removal of invalid administrative records addresses prior to best address selection. A valid address was defined as one that matched the DMAF or was deemed valid after a field address review. There was no provision for correcting enumerations at households with valid administrative records addresses. Non-matched DMAF addresses were canvassed in order to enumerate persons at addresses not found among the validated administrative records addresses. In the AREX, the canvassing was simulated by adding those persons found in Census 2000 at the unmatched addresses to the adjusted administrative-recordsonly counts, thus completing the enumeration. This phase of the AREX was designated as Bottom-up because it started with a known list of residential addresses (in this case the DMAF), matched the administrative records addresses to such a list, and reconciled any non-matched cases. The Bottom-up operational components of AREX were conducted on records contained within the five test site counties. These operations consisted of:       Computer matching AREX addresses to the DMAF. Clerical review of unmatched administrative records addresses. Field Address Verification of unmatched administrative record addresses Address re-selection. Census Pull, the simulated NRFU. Bottom-up enumeration.  Matching AREX records to the DMAF The DMAF Computer Match  The objective of the computer match operation was to determine the extent and nature of agreement between addresses from administrative records source files and eligible addresses from the Census Bureau's Decennial Master Address File (DMAF). To most accurately match the addresses, the AREX addresses were limited to those, which were geocoded, or with a standardized street name, a standardized property description or both. Excluded from the matching process were non-standardized addresses, standardized post office or box addresses, standardized post office and rural route addresses and undefined addresses. Table 7 shows the administrative records addresses and the DMAF addresses eligible for the computer match.  20   Table 7.

The final results were divided into matches; possible matches; non-matches and matches to duplicate DMAF addresses.

When this occurred, addresses were flagged as having duplicate matches. The duplicates were resolved later in the AREX operation where the best address was determined based on pre-defined criteria. Clerical Review of Unmatched Administrative Records Addresses  Following the computer match, the staff at the National Processing Center conducted a clerical review. The results of the clerical review are shown in Table 9.  21   Table 9.

The purposes of the FAV were to:    Verify the physical existence or nonexistence of non-matched AREX 2000 Test Site addresses. Correct erroneous address field values. Identify addresses meeting unique conditions such as being a duplicate of another address.  The original plan called for a review of 100 percent of the unmatched addresses by census field staff, but the plan was changed to have only a sample of addresses reviewed by Census Bureau Headquarters volunteers. The results from the sample were used to estimate a regression equation giving the probability of a valid address. The equation was then used to impute validity or lack thereof to the non-sample addresses. Sample design  After the computer phase of address matching, the universe of addresses eligible for Field Address Verification was first restricted to geocoded, city-style addresses within the AREX 2000 test site counties. The universe was further restricted to exclude some AREX 2000 test site ZIP codes that belonged to three colleges, a medical center, and an Air Force base in the belief that few or no residential addresses existed in those areas. With the redesign of the FAV operation, the addresses to be verified were based on a stratified cluster (Census block) sample of unmatched, city style addresses. The sample consisted of 112 blocks per AREX county and resulted in 6,644 addresses being flagged as part of the FAV sample (table 10).  22   Table 10. Selection of FAV Addresses Test Site State Maryland Colorado Total Number of FAV Eligible Addresses 96,202 57,333 153,535 Number of Addresses Selected for FAV Sample 2,914 3,730 6,644  After the fieldwork was completed and the results keyed, PRED staff then reviewed each of the listing pages and annotated a 5-digit status code on the page. The code categorized the type of activity about the address that was shown on the listing page and the validity of the address. In some instances, addresses were determined to be valid as listed (without changes). In other cases, corrections were made to the address to make the address valid. Table 11 provides the FAV sample results. Table 11. FAV Sample Results Test Site Maryland Colorado Total Number of Addresses Sampled 2,914 3,730 6,644 Percent Valid Percent Valid as Listed 13% 7% 10% Percent Valid After Lister Corrections 25% 34% 30%  38% 41% 40%  Of particular interest in this table are the percentages of addresses determined to be valid as listed. Because these addresses did not match the DMAF even after clerical review, it is possible that the DMAF was incomplete. However, this may also reflect residual difficulties in the matching process. Imputing validity to non-sample addresses  The FAV sample cases were used to estimate a logistic regression model, logit(P(y=1|x))= x. In this equation, the outcome measure y = 1 if the address was valid, y = 0 otherwise. The predictor variables, x, represented (1) characteristics of the administrative record addresses as possibly modified by the FAV review, (2) DMAF block size of the DMAF address to which the administrative record partially match, and  23   (3) the nature of the partial match. Generally, administrative records addresses were found more likely to be valid if they were not commercial, were found in multiple administrative record source files, had no unit identifier, and matched a DMAF address or addresses (by state, county, zip, street name, and street name suffix) for which there were no unit identifiers (i.e., it or they appeared to be a single-family dwelling or dwellings), and were located in blocks in which the DMAF indicated a fairly large number of addresses. The overall probability of misclassification--the probability that an address was not valid times the probability of a false positive plus the probability that an address was valid times the probability of false negative-- was estimated to be 0.32. (A detailed discussion of the model and regression results can be found in Bye, 2002.) Validity or lack thereof was imputed for all FAV eligible addresses that were not part of the sample by using the regression equation to calculate the probability that the address was valid, and comparing this value to a random number drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. If the random number was less than or equal to the predicted probability, the address was deemed to be valid for AREX Bottom-up address selection purposes. The net results of the Bottom-up administrative records addresses processing -- match of AREX addresses to the DMAF and the subsequent FAV -- are given in the following table. Table 12. Bottom-up Administrative Records Address Processing Addresses sent to DMAF Computer Match NonMatched Addresses after matched Addresses DMAF Computer Match and Clerical Review 543,881 459,753 1,003,634 112,392 71,629 184,021 FAV Eligible Addresses Number of valid Addresses of those eligible for FAV (FAV sample or imputed) 96,202 57,333 153,535 36,661 23,310 59,971  Test Site  Maryland Colorado Total  656,273 531,382 1,187,655  As a result of the FAV operations, 93,382 (153,535 - 59,971) of the FAV-eligible administrative records addresses were found to be invalid, and were not eligible for the Bottom-up address selection. Note, however, that unmatched addresses not eligible for the FAV remained in the Bottom-up address pool as a possible Bottom-up address.  24   Second DMAF match A second match of the AREX addresses was made to the DMAF for the purpose of transforming the collection geography to tabulation geography. Because the AREX addresses were initially geocoded to collection geography, it was necessary to translate the collection geographic codes into the tabulation geographic codes so that the comparisons to Census 2000 tabulations could be made. In general, the difference between collection blocks and tabulation blocks was that some collection blocks were split in final decennial census tallies. The contents of the DMAF were not stationary between the first and second match. There were a number of problems with duplicate MAFIDs for different addresses and multiple MAFIDs for the same address in both DMAF matches. Sometimes administrative records that matched the first time did not match the second. In these cases, if the original collection block was split into more than one tabulation block, then the address was statistically allocated to a tabulation block. (The second DMAF match also had an impact on Top-down block assignments.) Bottom-up address selection and composite person records For an address to be considered eligible for Bottom-up selection, the following conditions had to be met after the rematch to the DMAF: 1. The address had to have a Census tabulation block code. 2. The address could not have been identified as a commercial address during the FAV. 3. The address had to be either non-FAV eligible, a FAV sample address that was found to be valid during field review, deemed valid based on FAV imputation, or valid based on matching during the rematch to the DMAF. Once the pool of eligible addresses was identified and linked to the unduplicated list of AREX persons, the address selection operations were similar to the top down selection and identification of persons in administrative records who were eligible for the Bottomup enumeration were similar to those procedures used for Top-down selection. Generally, all the addresses associated with an individual were assembled and subjected to the address selection rules to obtain the ""best"" address for each individual in the administrative record source files. A possible outcome of the address selection process was that no persons remained at valid addresses in the AREX test sites. That is, although one or more persons were originally associated with the administrative record address, best address selection resulted in all persons at the address being assigned to another test site address or to an address outside the test site. These addresses were designated as AREX vacant addresses; there were 179,523 such addresses.  25   Simulated NRFU -- the Census Pull A principle feature of the Bottom-up process was to complete the enumeration by adding persons at test site addresses not found in administrative records. Presumably this would have been accomplished by some sort of mailout/mailback procedure or face-to-face interviews or both. This can be considered as an analogue to a conventional nonresponse followup; albeit in this case, the ""nonresponse"" is to the initial administrative records enumeration. For the AREX, the NRFU analogue was simulated by including persons found in the Census 2000 Hundred Percent Detail File (HDF) at addresses that were not found among the administrative records addresses, occupied or vacant. These were persons enumerated in Census 2000, and the assumption was that they would have been counted in the AREX had some sort of followup been instituted. The process of including persons from the Census 2000 HDF was referred to as the Census Pull. Table 13 shows the number of Census Pull addresses and persons included in the Bottomup enumeration. Table 13. Census Pull Results Census State Maryland Colorado Total 2000 Addresses 615,323 478,701 1,094,204 Census Pull Addresses 97,460 55,319 152,779 Census Pull Persons 185,868 126,558 312,426  Of the Census Pull addresses, 35,591 were vacant Census 2000 addresses. Revised race imputation for children under 18 Instead of using the race model to impute race for children under age 18 with unknown race in administrative records as was done in the Top-down process, an alternative imputation method was used. The source of most children in the AREX was the IRS 1040 file, which generally provided primary and secondary tax payers and up to four dependents in each tax unit. Children under 18 with unknown race, who could be associated with a tax unit, were assigned the race of the primary taxpayer.  26   Bottom-up results Overall enumeration  The AREX Bottom-up enumeration results are shown in Table 14. As expected, the coverage is much improved compared to the Top-down counts, and is largely due to the completion of the Top-down enumeration by the Census Pull. Specifically, the Bottomup coverage of children (81 percent - 94 percent across the test sites) is substantially better than the Top-down (72 percent - 83 percent). Adults in the Bottom-up are more or less uniformly overcounted (102 percent - 104 percent). The overcount of adults most likely is due to unaccounted for deaths in the previous 12 months, handling of special populations, and failure to unduplicate persons after the Census Pull (discussed later in the report). Of course, the latter means that there is some duplication for the children as well.  27   Table 14.

The impact of these operations on the administrative records part of the Bottom-up enumeration was threefold. First, administrative records addresses were removed from consideration if 7 The second match to the DMAF had an impact on address selection for both the Top-down and Bottomup and should not be considered solely a Bottom-up operation.  28   they did not match the DMAF, were FAV eligible but were not found or deemed to be valid by the FAV. Second, addresses that were not geocoded in the TIGER match or MAFGOR might have been coded through one or the other of these operations. Third, some of the addresses that were geocoded prior to the initial DMAF match might have received code changes. The impact of these operations on the addresses has been discussed in the relevant sections. Table 15 provides some information on the net impact of these operations on Bottom-up person tallies from administrative records, and provides a comparison of the Top-down and Bottom-up administrative records person tallies. Of the 2.3 million persons tallied in the Top-down enumeration, 70,031 (about 3 percent) were excluded from the Bottom-up administrative record counts. These exclusions occurred either because the only address that the persons had was rejected by the Bottomup processes or because the only remaining addresses were outside of the AREX test sites. For administrative records persons enumerated in both the Top-down and the Bottom-up, Table 15 provides information on the change in geographic location due to Bottom-up processes. Here, there seems to have been very little impact; over 99 percent of these persons were at the same address in both enumerations. Table 15. Geographic Differences for Persons in both the Top-down and Bottom-up methods Top-down in... Bottom-up total 2,275,456 100.0% Same Address 2,258,441 99.3% Different Address 17,015 0.8% Different Block 15,129 0.7% Different Tract 11,847 0.5% Different County 2,363 0.1%  Overall, the net effect of the Bottom-up operations on the administrative record tallies was quite modest. Bottom-up evaluation The Bottom-up evaluation focused on both operations and the goals of a decennial short form census.  29   AREX Bottom -up processing operations  DMAF computer match The computer match rate between eligible AREX addresses and the DMAF was only about 80 percent. A number of factors may have contributed to the match rate level. First, there is the vintage of the administrative record addresses. Most of the AREX addresses were of 1999 vintage, one year or older than the DMAF. Destruction of housing units and changes in official address components could account for some of the non-matches. Second, although a number of adjustments were made to the AutoMatch parameters to try to ensure optimum match rates, the clerical review following the computer match resulted in a substantial number of additional matches suggesting that there is still room for improvement in the use of matching software. The fact that most of the unmatched addresses were geocoded by TIGER or MAFGOR suggests just how difficult address matching can be. Third, a more consistent method of address standardization should improve the overall match rate. Throughout the course of creating the StARS database and subsequent iterations of the AREX address file, the Geography Division's address standardizer was employed. The dynamic nature of the standardizer software program and the flexibility of operator control during its application most likely contributed to inconsistencies and variances that led to erroneous non-matches (and matches as well). Although difficult to quantify, the application of a fixed version of the standardizer along with prescribed operator control methodologies should improve the overall match rate during the computer matching operations. Improving the computer match rate would, in turn, reduce the number of address records requiring clerical review. Finally, multiple MAFIDs assigned to a single address and duplicate MAFIDs assigned to multiple addresses contributed to the difficulty in classifying an address as matched, non-matched, or possibly matched. These difficulties may be due to the Census Bureau's methodology and audit trail for identification and retention of ""surviving MAFIDs"" on the DMAF as the DMAF changes over time. Further research needs to be done on the best formulation of DMAF extracts for administrative record matching. Second DMAF match Prior to the AREX enumeration, a second match to the DMAF was required to pick up ""tabulation"" block codes. The block codes obtained from the original TIGER match and MAFGOR operation were ""collection"" block codes. The difference between the codes is that some collection blocks were split as part of a final decennial census-coding scheme. The AREX needed to use the final block codes in order to facilitate comparisons between AREX and Census 2000 results. Addresses that did not match the second time and were  30   in collection blocks that had been split by one or more tabulation blocks were statistically allocated to one of the split blocks. Clerical review of non-matched AREX addresses The original AREX plan called for PRED staff to do the clerical review of the unmatched and possible-matched records after the initial match of the administrative records addresses to the DMAF. However, resource constraints due to changes in FAV plans required that the review be shifted to the National Processing Center (NPC). Accordingly, PRED trained approximately 25 reviewers to evaluate the possible matches of AREX addresses against the DMAF and make a match/non match determination for the address. Field Address Verification To minimize the impact of the lack of experience, the listers were not used in the traditional role of assigning action codes but rather to collect information about the address for later analysis and assignment of the action code. The listers answered 11 questions about the property from which the action code (called status code in this operation) was later assigned. This modification worked well in minimizing the mistakes made by inexperienced staff and created a collateral benefit of collecting detailed information about the addresses for further research and analysis. One way to improve the list of addresses eligible for FAV is to improve the identification and removal of commercial addresses from the AREX address files. The product used was the American Business Information (ABI), Inc. database file of commercial addresses (more than 10 million) based on national telephone directories (both yellow and white pages). Budgetary constraints precluded purchase of the ABI residential file. The use of both files (commercial and residential) would have improved the accuracy of commercial address identification and reduced the size of the FAV eligible address list as well. It is difficult to gauge the impact of the FAV because the actual review was carried out on a small sample and because of the classification error associated with the imputation based on the regression equation. But there are some things that can be learned from the FAV sample. The sample addresses were drawn from a list that did not match any address in the initial DMAF match. About 25 percent of the sample addresses found to be valid upon field review were found to be valid as listed. They represent about 10 percent of all FAV eligible addresses. The remaining 75 percent of valid sample addresses (30 percent of all eligible addresses) were found to be valid after lister corrections. It turned out that none of this group matched a Census 2000 address in the second match to the DMAF nor, of course, did the uncorrected valid group. It is not known whether any of these addresses  31   truly represent addresses not in the DMAF or are unmatched as a result of inaccuracies in the address matching process. Table 16 shows Bottom-up ""best"" administrative records addresses by FAV status. Table 16. Bottom-up ""best"" address by FAV Status. FAV Valid Imputed Valid Not FAV Eligible Valid in Second DMAF Match, Only AREX Occupied 1,084 43% AREX Vacant 1,420 57% Total 2,504 100% 24,703 47% 28,242 53% 52,945 100% 855,946 86% 142,253 14% 998,199 100% 3,775 33% 7,608 67% 11,383 100% 885,508 83% 179,523 17% 1,065,031 100% Total  It is interesting to note that FAV sample addresses selected as best addresses were much more likely to be vacant than addresses that were not FAV eligible. The FAV imputed addresses had occupancy rates that were similar to the sample. The number of persons counted at FAV sample addresses was 2,162 and at FAV imputed addresses, 44,912 for a total of 47,074. Inflating the FAV sample persons by the reciprocal of the average selection probability (i.e. 2,162(1/. 0433)) yields 49,931, much of the difference presumably due to address misclassification as a result of the imputation. However, the closeness of the numbers suggests that a 100 percent FAV would have yielded results similar to the combined sample and imputation scheme. Including AREX vacant housing in the Census Pull The AREX address selection rules resulted in almost 180,000 vacant addresses thought to be valid for the AREX test sites. Such addresses that are actually found in the AREX sites through a match to the Census 2000 HDF would appear to be conceptually similar to the addresses included in the Census Pull. Both kinds of addresses represent housing units in the AREX sites for which no administrative records persons were found to be resident. In both cases, it might have been that some addresses were truly vacant on census day and others truly occupied. For the latter, deficiencies in the administrative records or administrative records processing resulted in the persons not being counted or counted at the wrong address.  32   A match of the AREX vacant addresses to the Census 2000 HDF, in fact, found about 76,000 matched addresses, and almost 67,000 were occupied in Census 2000. (Refer to the analysis in Section 3 of this report.) Of course, some of these persons may be the same as persons counted at other administrative records addresses; but the same could be said for the persons found at the Census Pull addresses. Therefore, in a Bottom-up process, both types of addresses should have been canvassed; and the AREX vacant addresses that matched addresses in the Census 2000 HDF should have been included in the Census Pull. Unduplication after the Census Pull There should have been an unduplication of individuals after the Census Pull by matching persons obtained in the Pull with those from the administrative records lists. The presence of duplicate individuals is suggested not only by the overcounts of adults shown in various tables, but also by a comparison of the total number of Bottom-up addresses with the number of Census 2000 addresses in the test sites. The total number of addresses in the Bottom-up was 1,217,810 -- 1,065,031 administrative record addresses and 152,779 from the Census Pull. The number of Census 2000 address in the test sites was 1,094,204. Thus, there were 123,606 more addresses in the Bottom-up enumeration than in Census 2000. One way to accomplish the unduplication would be to search and verify the SSNs for the individuals in the Census Pull and compare them with the SSNs of the individuals in the administrative records lists. This might not be completely effective because being part of the Census Pull suggests that blocking on address will not facilitate the SSN search. Alternatively, the Census Pull individuals could be matched directly with the administrative record list blocking variously on such variables as surname and date of birth. When duplicate individuals were found, the Census Pull could be taken as more accurate and the individuals would be removed from the administrative records address. This approach could result in some additional vacant addresses, so that the process might have to be repeated several times in order to identify the ""best"" address for all persons. In the end, there could be vacant administrative record addresses that should have been filled by persons erroneously located outside of the AREX sites in the administrative records systems. This would imply that a national unduplication would be part of a full Bottomup census. Such an unduplication was out of scope for the experiment.  33   3.  AREX OUTCOMES AND HOUSEHOLD EVALUATIONS  3.1 Introduction The evaluation of the numerical findings of the AREX was twofold. First there was a comparison of the results of the Top-down and Bottom-up enumerations with the Census 2000 enumeration in the experimental test sites (Heimovitz 2002). This analysis progressed from large geographic areas to small geographic areas, beginning with the five test site counties and ending with Census 2000 blocks within the sites. The outcomes evaluation tried to disentangle the influence of demographic change and AREX processing, coverage and data quality issues, while presenting basic enumeration statistics. Below the county level, the analysis focused on the Bottom-up enumeration because the county-level analysis was sufficient to show the evident weaknesses of the Top-down process. Section 3.2 provides some of the highlights of portions of Heimovitz's report; there was also a regression analysis that is omitted here. The primary goal of the second evaluation was to assess the accuracy of households assembled from administrative records by comparing them to Census 2000 enumeration results at the same addresses (Judson and Bauder, 2002). This was a particularly important analysis for the type of design that the AREX mounted because the completion of an administrative records enumeration by canvassing addresses not found in the records provides little opportunity to correct enumeration errors in the administrative records themselves. Thus, it was important to learn as much as possible about the strengths and weaknesses in the administrative records households with an eye toward future improvements. In the course of the household-level analysis, some preliminary information about a possible use of administrative records in a conventional census was obtained. The question of interest was: Under what conditions can administrative records households be substituted for conventional Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) households, or households for which occupancy status and household demographics were wholly imputed (""unclassified"" households)? This assessment was carried out by matching the demographic composition of AREX households to Census 2000 households which were difficult to enumerate in Census 2000. In addition to a descriptive analysis, there was a prediction-based approach to assess the ability to predict when an AREX household is likely to demographically match a census household. Section 3.3 provides a summary of the results in the report by Judson and Bauder.  34   3.2 AREX enumeration outcomes Methodology Concept  The enumeration outcomes analysis provides measures of how well AREX replicates Census 2000 results at county and subcounty levels focusing on key demographic characteristics that are important for decennial census requirements but also relate to the possible use of administrative records for intercensal and small-area estimation. A series of research questions provides a conceptual outline of the basic elements of the evaluation. General questions at larger geographies are posed first:   How well does AREX measure total census population at the county level, and how do the results differ by whether the Top-down or Bottom-up approaches were used? How do county-level differences between AREX and census differ by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin, as well as between the Top-down or Bottom-up approaches?  A related question, how well does AREX measure the voting age population (age 18+) of state legislative districts, is discussed in Heimovitz, 2002. In a decennial census, total population counts are needed for congressional apportionment. The voting age (18+) population by race and Hispanic origin potentially meets the data requirements for legislative redistricting. Population counts of persons under age 18 are needed by states for planning purposes and estimating child poverty rates. Greater differences between AREX and census counts are more likely at smaller geographies. But focusing on smaller geographies allows more detailed analyses of neighborhood characteristics and whether these attributes are linked with AREX-Census 2000 differences: In particular, how does the accuracy of tract and block counts compare to county results? Outcome measures  The terms `undercount' and `overcount' describe how well AREX counts match Census 2000 results and have no further connotation. That is, undercounts and overcounts reflect any of several problems, including coverage issues, coding, and processing errors. Outcome and predictor constructs are distinguished and used to highlight AREX-Census 2000 Bottom-up and Top-down differences. The outcome measures used in this consolidated report are limited to the simple count differences between AREX and Census 2000 counts and to the algebraic percent error (ALPE). The full outcomes analysis (Heimovitz 2002) provides additional measures.  35   Difference  The simple difference between AREX and Census 2000 gauges the county-level over and under-counts: DIFF(Ai,Ci) = Ai -Ci where: Ai = AREX tallies in county Ci = Decennial census tallies in county  Algebraic percent error (ALPE)  AREX and Census 2000 counts are the inputs for calculating the algebraic percent error for the ith county, tract, or block:  ALPE(A i , C i ) =  Ai - C Ci  i  Where: Ai = AREX tallies in the ith county, tract, or block; and Ci = Decennial census tallies in the ith county, tract, or block Two problems can occur when computing ALPEs: zero blocks and inflated ALPEs. Zero blocks occur when AREX reports in a particular block at least one person having a particular characteristic but census does not. Because Census 2000 is being used as the standard and is the denominator, ALPEs for zero blocks are undefined. For the purpose of block comparisons, zero blocks are omitted from the analyses. However, county and tract-level counts and comparisons include these blocks because they are aggregated at larger geographies. Inflated ALPEs can sometimes occur when Census 2000 blocks have very small counts and tend to produce large, positive ALPEs, despite small differences between AREX and Census 2000 counts. For example, C=1 and A=3 yields an ALPE=2. Such a large ALPE is quite unlikely when the size of C--the number of persons enumerated in the census area--is large. Small census counts are not unlikely, for example, for racial minorities in sparsely populated areas. To reduce the impact of unusually large ALPEs, ALPEs were trimmed (topcoded) by setting all values greater than the 95th percentile of the ALPEs across the areas in the analysis to the value of the 95th percentile. Still, care should be taken in interpreting results for those analyses where the population is sparsely populated within the geographic units of interest.  36   There is an additional problem when computing differences or ALPEs for racial subpopulations. The problem stems from the differences between AREX and Census 2000 classifications. Both AREX and Census 2000 have the four traditional categories: White, Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander8. But Census 2000 permits respondents two additional options: ""multiple race,"" and ""Other race."" These additional groups were quite small for Maryland. For Colorado, the multi and other race groups were much larger, encompassing more than 8 percent of the Census 2000 population for El Paso County. In the following outcomes analysis, no attempt was made to distribute either additional race category across the four common categories. Excluding Census 2000 respondents with multi or other race could result in positive differences and ALPEs for race subgroups, especially for minority groups, that might not have occurred had the AREX and census classifications been the same. Descriptive analyses This section is intended to be a top-level, descriptive summary of AREX-Census 2000 differences, by county, tract, and block. County-level counts and proportions are compared and display the raw, untransformed numbers not shown in the multivariate analyses. The count differences describe the aggregate under- and over-counts of age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin categories, while the ALPEs show the contribution these categories have on the under- and overcounts. One important aspect of the bivariate analyses is the ecological variation within the AREX counties. Thematic maps profile the heterogeneous AREX-Census 2000 differences in block-level total population counts. AREX Top-down counts include persons later identified in Bottom-up as group quarters residents; Bottom-up and Census 2000 counts exclude group quarters residents and differ somewhat from counts in earlier tables for which there were no exclusions. County-level count results  Total population Total population results for the two Maryland counties and three Colorado counties are reported in Table 17.  8  Multiple Census 2000 categories were combined for Asian/Pacific Islander.  37   Table 17.

The greatest Top-down differences were in Baltimore City and Jefferson County. Bottom-up undercounts are much smaller than Top-down undercounts in all five counties for total population and demographic characteristics.  38   Figure 2. Net Population Difference by Sex, County, and Collection Method--CO.  Sex  39   Figure 3. Net Population Difference by Sex, County, and Collection Method--MD.  Males and females are undercounted by the Top-down method in all five counties. Bottom-up undercounts are much smaller for all counties, and males are overcounted in Baltimore City. (Baltimore CTY is Baltimore County.)  40   Age  Figure 4. Net Population Difference by Age, County and Collection Method--MD.  41   Figure 5. Net Population Difference by Age, County and Collection Method--CO.  In the Maryland counties, Top-down overcounts the 75+ population and undercounts other age groups; Bottom-up overcounts the 20-44, and 65+ age groups and undercounts all other age groups. In both Maryland and Colorado, Top-down undercounts are greatest for the 0-19 age groups and show the greatest improvements for Bottom-up counts relative to Top-down. In the Colorado counties, generally, age 20-24 and 65+ age groups are overcounted and other age groups are undercounted for both Top-down and Bottomup methods.  42   Race In the Maryland counties, Hispanics were overcounted and other minority race groups were generally undercounted in Top-down and Bottom-up. In the Bottom-up method, Whites and Blacks were overcounted in Baltimore City where Blacks are a majority. In the Colorado counties, Blacks and APIs were generally overcounted while other race categories and Hispanics were undercounted in Top-down and Bottom-up methods. Figure 6. Net Population Difference by Race, County and Collection Method--MD.  43   Figure 7. Net Population Difference by Race, County and Collection Method--CO.  One general pattern from tables and figures above is the relationship between population shares and AREX under- and overcount. Race and Hispanic origin groups with smaller shares tend to be overcounted, and groups with larger shares tend to be undercounted. Examples of overcounts are Hispanics in the Maryland counties, Whites in Baltimore City, and Blacks and APIs in the CO counties. The very large Top-down undercount of Blacks in Baltimore City is due largely to the inappropriate use of the race model for children in the Top-down process. The Black count changes dramatically in the Bottom-up in which children with unknown race are generally assigned the race of the primary taxpayer. County-level ALPE results  The county-level analysis builds on the AREX-Census 2000 count results by the algebraic percent error (ALPE). The ALPE measure provides a different county-level results because the calculation method uses census group totals provides a standardized gauge for comparing differences between Top-down up, as well as between counties.  examining view of the as bases and and Bottom-  44   Total Population All county Bottom-up ALPEs were smaller than Top-down ALPEs; Bottom-up ALPE improvements were variable: both Douglas County and Baltimore City had Top-down ALPEs of -8.8 percent, but Bottom-up for Douglas County was -3.2 percent compared to +1.8 percent for Baltimore City. The smallest total population Bottom-up ALPE was in Baltimore County (-1.1 percent); the largest Bottom-up ALPE was in Douglas County (-3.2 percent).  45   Sex  Figure 8. Sex ALPE by County and Collection Method--MD.  Male and female Bottom-up ALPEs were relatively small in all five counties and ranged from  4.8 to + 4.2 percent. Sex proportions were undercounted in all counties (except Baltimore City males) and generally are unbiased, reflecting the magnitude of total county-level proportions. Female undercounts were slightly worse than male undercounts and generally had a marginal difference of less than 2 percent in Bottom-up. Some women may be less active within the administrative records systems. For example, some studies indicate that lifetime participation in the labor force varies by a woman's child raising and care giving experiences, health status, and race/ethnicity (Flippen and Tienda, 2000). However, lower mortality rates for women might offset lower labor force participation with respect to AREX/Census 2000 comparisons.  46   Figure 9. Sex ALPE by County and Collection Method--CO.  Age Generally, younger age groups (especially the 0-4 age group) had the largest negative ALPEs in all five counties. Bottom-up ALPEs for the 0-4 age group ranged from 33.9 percent in Jefferson County to 23.4 percent in Baltimore City. Older age groups (65-74, 75-84, and 85+) tended to have positive ALPEs that increased by age. Bottom-up ALPEs were generally smaller due to the Census-pull households that replaced unmatched Census 2000 addresses.  47   Figure 10. Age ALPE by County and Collection Method--MD.  Figure 11. Age ALPE by County and Collection Method--CO.  48   The large negative ALPEs for children and the large positive ALPES for older groups are due mostly to the weaknesses in the administrative records discussed in Section 2: missing births and deaths and migration as a result of the cutoff dates of the administrative record files used in the AREX, missing dependents on IRS 1040s, and missing children of parents who did not have to file 1040s or were otherwise not found in the administrative records. Persons aged 65+ were generally overcounted in all five counties, and persons age 85+ displayed Bottom-up overcounts ranging from about 2 percent to 36 percent--77 percent in less-populated Douglas County. Because the 85+ population is relatively small, the denominators of the ALPE calculations are likely to be small and potentially inflate ALPE measures. The 20-24 year age group also has large positive ALPEs in some of the AREX counties. This might be due to the handling of special populations to which this age group belongs: college and university population, and the military. College-age persons whose residence may have been reported at a parent's IRS tax address may actually reside on a campus in a different area. Removing group quarters from the Census 2000 counts but not from the Top-down counts would bias Top-down ALPEs in the positive direction. Removing group quarters from the Bottom-up counts would still leave dependents claimed on IRS 1040 at the wrong location with respect to decennial residency rules. Douglas County appears to be a special case. The Census 2000 population age 20-24 is 3.1 percent, less than half that of Colorado (7.1 percent) and the national average (6.7 percent). But the Air Force Academy and several other schools are located in Douglas County. The large Top-down ALPE may be due to the fact that group quarters were not removed from the administrative records. Although there was an attempt to remove group quarters from Bottom-up enumeration, the large Bottom-up ALPE for age 20-24 suggests this may not have been fully successful. Race It is difficult to interpret Top-down race ALPEs because of the confounding effects of general undercounts, especially for children, and the use of the race model for children under 15 with ""other"" or unknown race in the administrative records. The following discussion will focus on the Bottom-up results. There are a number of reasons for the patterns of Bottom-up race and Hispanic origin ALPEs. First is the use of the race model. As discussed earlier, the race model was a national-level model and variation about its predictions can be expected. The use of the model in small geographic areas would tend to overstate the number of persons in those race groups that are less than the national average and understate the number of persons in groups that are above the national average. When modeled race was assigned to children from an adult in the same household, the result would be reinforced.  49   Figure 12. Race ALPE by County and Collection Method--MD.  Figure 13. Race ALPE by County and Collection Method--CO.  It is important to keep in mind that the race model was used for only those adults whose administrative records did not provide a race other than ""other"" or unknown. Table 3 in Section 2.2 shows the proportion of adults and children with imputed race in each of the  50   test sites. The number of adults with was substantially lower in Maryland was used well over 90 percent of the records provide no direct measure of  imputed race ranged from about 3 to 9 percent and than Colorado. For Hispanic origin, the imputation time because, for the most part, administrative ethnicity.  Other factors possibly affecting Bottom-up ALPE race patterns were: The possible correlation between weaknesses in AREX population coverage and race or Hispanic origin, unaccounted for migration and demographic changes due to the age of the administrative records files, the possible duplication of persons due to the Census Pull, the problem of comparing AREX and Census 2000 race groups because the latter allows ""multi"" and ""other"" and the former does not, and the positive ALPE bias for cells with small denominators. Examining several of the race ALPE results shows the complexity of the possible explanations. For the Bottom-up, Black ALPEs were positive in all three Colorado counties and Baltimore City and negative in Baltimore County (where blacks are a large minority race group). The overcount of Blacks in Colorado was most likely due to the race model because the proportion of Blacks in Colorado was much smaller than the national average; and at the same time, the proportion of adults in Colorado with imputed race was relatively high, ranging from 6 to 9 percent. The undercount of Blacks in Baltimore County might be due in part to the use of the race model; but it might also be due in part to the migration of Blacks from Baltimore City to the County in the period between the administrative records cutoffs and April 1, 2000. The reasons for the overcount of Blacks in Baltimore City are less clear but might also be due to unaccounted for migration of Blacks from the city. An overcount is the reverse of what would be expected if the race model were the main cause, and the proportion of adults with modeled race was under 3 percent. The ALPEs for APIs were positive in all three Colorado counties and Baltimore City and negative in Baltimore County. This would appear again to be a race model effect, except for Baltimore County, because nationally, all five counties have API proportions below the national average. Evidently, the net effect of these differences increased the size of the Census 2000 API counts enough so that API ALPEs for all of the AREX sites would have been negative had they been calculated from these distributions. In any case, it is simply a matter that ALPE is sensitive for small population subgroups. Concerning APIs, the substantial negative ALPEs in all counties were not unexpected. Identifying AIAN race is weak in the administrative records, except, in areas around reservations, and AIAN prediction was the weakest part of the race model as well. Hispanic ALPEs were positive in both MD counties where they are a small minority group and negative in all three CO counties where Hispanics are the largest minority group. The model for Hispanic origin was applied to about 97 percent of adults in Maryland and is most likely the reasons for the substantial overcounts there. Again, one might have also expected small overcounts in Colorado were model use the main factor. (See the discussion of Hispanics in Section 2) But the substantial undercounts suggest  51   that other factors may be at work such as high birth rates and net in-migration of Hispanics in the period missed by the administrative records used in the AREX. Tract ALPE distributions  Error! Reference source not found. shows the ALPE distributions for the five AREX counties. In all sites other than Baltimore City, more than 70 percent of tracts had AREX total population counts within +/-5 percent of census results, and more than 95 percent of tracts had counts within 25 percent of census results. Baltimore City had less accurate results with about 50 percent of tracts exceeding +/-5 percent of census results. A larger proportion of tracts had moderate and large ALPE undercounts (less than 5 percent) compared to overcounts. Figure 14. Distribution of Tracts with Under- and Overcounts of Total Population.  Though the tract-level ALPEs for the total population resemble county-level results, the distributions indicate more Baltimore City tracts were overcounted. It is unclear whether these overcounts are related to persons who were actually uncounted in the census, or more likely, weaknesses in AREX processing. Households may have been added through the Census Pull process that replaced unmatched addresses that existed in other tracts or addresses.  52   Block ALPE distributions  The block-level ALPE results describe the accuracy of counts at the smallest geographic level and relative to counties and tracts. The main problem with this type of comparison is the ALPE denominator potentially inflates block-level ALPEs for small population subgroups and especially minorities. This inflation is likely to be greater than found in the tract-county comparisons. A second issue affecting comparisons is the exclusion of blocks where Census 2000 did not identify persons with a particular attribute (zero blocks). County and tract ALPEs include blocks with zero counts because these blocks were accumulated into larger geographies. However, the block-level ALPEs used the reduced set of blocks and the results may be quite different when comparing the ALPEs at various geographies. Figure 15. Distribution of Blocks with Under- and Overcounts of Total Population.  AREX was less accurate in estimating blocks than tracts in all counties. Population totals for 18 to 39 percent of blocks were within 5 percent of Census 2000, and about 85 percent were within 25 percent of the census. Douglas County had the best results at the 5 percent criterion and Baltimore County was best at the 25 percent criterion. In the Maryland counties, slightly more blocks had moderate or large overcounts (ALPEs exceeding 5 percent), compared to the Colorado counties where more blocks had moderate undercounts (-5 to -24 percent).  53   The AREX counts were less accurate at the block-level. Population counts are likely to be less accurate in smaller areas due to incorrect assignment of households at tracts and blocks that average out for county-level counts. This is demonstrated by the greater number of moderate and large ALPEs and indicates how smaller denominators and AREX processing weaknesses influenced the comparisons. Though zero blocks were excluded and fewer blocks met the 5 percent criterion, a large proportion of blocks met the 25 percent criterion in all five counties.  Geospatial Tract-Level Heterogeneity  Error! Reference source not found. and Error! Reference source not found. exhibit the geographic distribution of AREX-Census 2000 tract ALPEs for total population counts. Baltimore City is the nucleus of the MD AREX site and the most urban of all the sites. It has numerous tracts with large under and overcounts. The tract-level total population was clearly measured better in Baltimore County. There is also evidence of tracts clustering by size of under and overcounts. Downtown Baltimore and Towson include islands of moderate and large undercounts, while clustered moderate overcounts are more frequent in other parts of the City and County. Denver, in the north, and Colorado Springs are metropolitan centers in the CO site (Map 2). Generally, the tractlevel CO population was counted more accurately in the suburbs of each city, while urban and rural tracts tended to have moderate undercounts.  54   Figure 16.

As expected, the Bottom-up method performed better than the Top-down method because of the simulated canvassing of households (the Census Pull) at addresses not found in the administrative records. The Bottom-up process undercounted total population in all sites except Baltimore City. Algebraic percent errors for county-level population totals were less than 5 percent though the results were not as good for subcounty and demographic subgroups. If the Bottom-up process were unbiased and counted all demographic groups in the same way, ALPEs for all demographic categories would have had the same relative size. As with the total population, males and females were undercounted in all sites except Baltimore City, but the female undercounts were slightly greater than male undercounts. Age group ALPEs show more variability with most groups undercounted except the 2024 group and the oldest age groups. Generally the size of the undercounts increased with decreasing age. These patterns did not appear to be site-specific and are the result of the weaknesses of the administrative records and certain AREX processing decisions as discussed in Section 2. Overcounts for the oldest old and undercounts for the youngest persons suggest that much more timely birth and death information must be obtained. And the special enumeration requirements for populations such as college students, the military and persons in nursing homes must be incorporated into administrative records processes. Bottom-up tract-level total population ALPE results indicated a good correspondence between AREX and Census 2000 (70 percent of tracts met the 5 percent criterion; and 95 percent met the 25 percent criterion), though a sizable number of tracts had moderate and large ALPE undercounts. The block-level ALPE results provided the least accurate measure of total population (38 percent of blocks met the 5 percent criterion; and about 85 percent met the 25 percent criterion), compared to tract and county results9. The regression results confirm some of the key findings from the univariate and bivariate analyses. Among the mobility variables, both vacancy rate and rental rate were associated with under and overcounts. Generally, rental rate had a greater association with undercounts and vacancy rates had a greater association with overcounts in both AREX sites. As observed in the bivariate analyses, large proportions of persons under 9  From data not shown in this report (but available from Heimovitz, 2002) ALPE results for sex and age were similar for tract and county analyses. Baltimore City had the worst results for total and demographic ALPE measures but the most accurate results for blacks. However, Baltimore City also had the largest proportion of census pull records and smallest proportion of imputed black race codes. For the race/Hispanic minority groups, the relative size of the minority population in the tract was associated with how well AREX simulated Census results. Tracts with small minority proportions were more likely to have moderate or large positive ALPEs than other tracts.  57   age 5 and 20-24 were associated with undercounts in both sites. And in CO, large proportions of persons age 65+ were associated with overcounts, other factors held constant (Heimovitz, 2002).  3.3 Household-level analysis Methodology Concept  The general goal of the household-level analysis (Judson and Bauder, 2002) was to assess how well households formed from administrative records matched those from Census 2000 at the same addresses in the Hundred Percent Detail (HDF) file. The analysis did not include group quarters or the households found at addresses not in the administrative records files. An assessment of group quarters was beyond the scope of this analysis because AREX did not mount the operations that would have been needed to enumerate special populations in an administrative records census context. And, the Bottom-up ""NRFU"" households could not be evaluated because the canvassing was simulated by simply including the Census 2000 households at the relevant addresses. The household-level analysis assessed the ability of AREX administrative records households to match the demographic composition of all households, but there was a special focus on Census 2000 households that required a nonresponse followup and Census 2000 unclassified households. In Census 2000, addresses that did not respond to the mailout had to be enumerated by nonresponse followup procedures. NRFU addresses are the most expensive to enumerate and may represent the most vulnerable segment of Americans. The household-level analysis provided a preliminary look at the conditions under which households formed from administrative records could be used for conventional NRFU households, obviating the need for fieldwork in those cases. Addresses that had the status ""unclassified"" in Census 2000 were those for which so little information was available that occupancy status had to be imputed, and, conditional on being imputed ""occupied,"" the entire household, including characteristics, had to be imputed as well. This treatment of unclassified households was the subject of a lawsuit reaching the U.S. Supreme Court (Utah v. Evans), in which the plaintiffs objected to the imputation substituting for enumeration. Although the census methodology prevailed, the possibility of enumerating these types of addresses by administrative records might provide a useful alternative to traditional imputation. This section provides some information comparing administrative records enumeration and Census 2000 imputations for the Census 2000 unclassified households in the AREX test sites.  58   Special terminology  For this section, the term ""census household"" refers to the persons enumerated at an address in Census 2000. The term ""AREX household"" refers to persons at an administrative records address. ""Household size"" refers to the number of people in the housing unit. For convenience, these definitions are applied to vacant housing units, so that when a Census or AREX address contains no people, the housing unit is assigned a household size of zero. We use the term ""imputed household"" for unclassified addresses whose occupancy status and household characteristics have been imputed. Pairs of addresses (AREX and Census) that were matched by computer or clerical processes are referred to as ""linked"" housing units. The term ""linked households"" is used when comparing the properties of people within linked housing units. The term ""demographic match"" is used when two households have the same age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin distribution. Finally, the term ""AREX data"" is used for administrative data obtained from the Bottomup operations (i.e., including DMAF linkage, clerical review and FAV). The term ""Census data"" is used for data obtained from the Census 2000 HDF file. Descriptive analysis  The household-level evaluation used both descriptive analyses and multiple regression analysis to assess the coverage and accuracy of AREX households. Descriptive analyses were performed for linked households in all five AREX counties and for the Census 2000 NRFU and imputed households in the test sites. These analyses provided the following evaluations:     Coverage by AREX of its intended universe by determining the number and proportion of Census 2000 addresses that were matched by AREX addresses; Characteristics of Census 2000 households associated with AREX/Census matched addresses; Comparison of AREX and Census 2000 distributions of household size and household demographic characteristics; Characteristics of AREX households associated household-to-household comparisons, including a person in the household of a particular race or person with a characteristic that was imputed in with AREX/Census 2000 such properties as the presence of ethnicity, and the presence of a AREX.  59   Prediction model  To learn more about the characteristics of administrative records households that match the census and to take a first look at the potential uses of administrative records data to substitute for some part of the nonresponse followup or unclassified households in a conventional census, a logistic regression model was developed with the AREX/Census 2000 linked households as the units of analysis. The functional form of the model is Logit (Match=1|x) = x where Match is a dichotomous dependent variable, x is a vector of regressors, and  is a vector of constants to be estimated. For each linked address, the dependent variable was defined as follows:  if the fully crossed age  race  sex  Hispanic origin distributions in the 1 Match =  linked Census household match the AREX household; 0 otherwise.   This measure was based on the distribution of personal characteristics within an address and not on matches of individual persons. An address in AREX and in the census that had exactly the same distributional characteristics but were composed of entirely different persons would still receive a match score of 1. The simpler dependent variable-1 if all persons were the same, 0 otherwise--was not used because the AREX operations did not provide for matching individuals from AREX and census enumerations. Considering that the age distribution is in 5-year groups, the match definition used would appear to provide a result very close to an exact person match. The regressors include characteristics of AREX households and characteristics of the linked addresses, representing the kind of information that would be available were data from administrative records to be used in support of a conventional census. Limitations  The principal limitations on the ability to link addresses and demographically match households stemmed from the same deficiencies of the AREX administrative records files discussed in previous sections. First, the administrative data extracts were taken a year or more before census day. This means that movers, births, deaths, immigration and emigration, new housing, abandoned and demolished housing were unaccounted for a period of 12 or more months prior to census day. Second, many children are unaccounted for in administrative records at the national level; and therefore, AREX 2000 had difficulty enumerating children, generally, and, specifically, by virtue of the time lag problem and the limited demographics available for children on the Numident file (Miller, Judson, and Sater, 2000). Third, the race measurement and reporting deficiencies of the administrative records and differences in race measurement between AREX and the census presented serious challenges to comparisons matching race and Hispanic origin between members of AREX and census households. Finally, virtually all  60   persons identified as having Hispanic origin in the AREX were imputed as such thus weakened the comparisons. The AREX FAV had little impact on the household-level analysis; and a 100 percent FAV, if actually carried out, would have had little impact as well. Persons at administrative records addresses that would have been completely lost to the AREX as a result of the FAV would have had no impact on the household-level analysis since none of their addresses match the DMAF. And, as discussed in Section 2, there were would have been very few persons who remained in the enumeration but at different addresses as a result of the FAV. Finally, deficiencies in administrative records and HDF addresses (for example, address duplication) and address matching technology resulted in a number of cases in which more than one administrative record address matched the same HDF address and vice versa. All of the administrative records addresses that matched the HDF but not on a one-to-one basis were excluded from the analyses. Descriptive Analysis AREX and Census address linkage  In the five counties covered by the experiment, the Census 2000 HDF contained 1,092,460 housing units (HUs) and 1744 group quarters (GQs), the latter excluded from this analysis. 24,584 (2.3 percent) of census households were ""imputed households,"" and 360,914 (33.0 percent) were in the Census 2000 NRFU universe. Of the 1,065,031 AREX addresses 992,865 were linked with addresses that existed in Census HDF; but 103,227 of the AREX addresses did not have a one-to-one link and were also excluded. This left 889,638 linked AREX addresses available for the household-level analysis. They represented 81.4 percent of census addresses. Table 18 provides data on overall address linkage. AREX housing units (i.e. addresses) were linked with 84.0 percent of the 1,017,273 occupied census housing units. AREX housing units were linked with 46.4 percent of the 75,187 vacant census housing units. About 88 percent of AREX vacant units were found to be occupied by the census10. This confirms the discussion in Section 2 in which it was suggested that the AREX vacant addresses should have been canvassed as part of the Bottom-up process.  10  Recall that AREX vacant housing units are those with an address that was linked to the HDF but for which no persons remained after best address selection.  61   Table 18.

This may be due to several factors: (1) components of addresses from NRFU and/or imputed housing units might be generally of lower quality, and thus harder to match; (2) addresses of these housing units may be of types that are harder to match, e.g., those in apartment buildings, those on Rural Routes, or at P.O. boxes; and (3) people in these housing units may be more likely not to show up on any of the administrative records used for AREX. AREX and Census household size  All occupied households Table 21 shows the distributions of household size for linked and non-linked occupied households in AREX and for Census. The AREX distribution of household size was quite similar to the census distribution. Table 21. Distributions of household size for Census and AREX for all five AREX counties.

One possible explanation of this fact is that a much higher percentage of one-person households were at basic street addresses at which there are multiple housing units, and addresses at such basic street addresses (BSAs) were harder to link.  64   Linked occupied and non-occupied households AREX and Census 2000 counted the same number of people in the housing unit for 51.1 percent of the 889,638 linked households, and AREX was within one of the census for 79.4 percent of the units. The 51.1 percent is effectively a ceiling on the percent of linked households that had exactly the same persons from AREX and Census 2000. Although errors in address linkage would account for some of the mismatched households, the deficiencies in administrative records cited earlier in this report--missing children, lack of special population operations and the time gap between the administrative records extracts and census day--most likely account for the major part. For linked NRFU housing units, AREX had the same numbers of persons for 37.0 percent of the units and was within one 69.3 percent of the time. Evidently, Census 2000 NRFU housing units are more susceptible to AREX deficiencies than non-NRFU units. In addition, enumeration errors (such as ""curbstoning"") in Census 2000 may be higher for these units than for units that responded to the initial mailout. For the 15,043 linked imputed occupied households, AREX had the same count for 31.8 percent, and was within one for 66.8 percent of these addresses. The low percentage of household-by-household agreement between AREX and the census for imputed households should be expected from the error introduced by the imputation.  65   Table 22.

Because comparisons within households of different sizes are difficult to interpret, only linked occupied housing units in which AREX and Census 2000 have the same number of people are considered. There are 454,437 of these housing units representing 42.6 percent of all census housing units, 42.7 percent of all AREX housing units, and 51.2 percent of all linked housing units. Tables 23-25 contain data only for linked households for which AREX and the census had the same total count. The tables show the frequencies with which AREX and the census agree for each: Sex category; Race category: White, Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Pacific Islander; Hispanic origin category, i.e. Hispanic/non-Hispanic; Five-year age category: 0-4, 5-9, ..., 80-84, 85 and up; Of the age categories: 0-17, 18-64, and 65 and up. As expected, the agreements for racial composition and Hispanic origin composition were good -- in general, well above 90 percent. Generally household members tend to be all of one race and Hispanic origin. Also as expected, agreement rates did decline with household size because the likelihood of missing or AREX imputed race and different Hispanic origin imputations increases with number of persons in the household. Agreement between AREX and the census across 5-year age groups provides an estimate of the proportion of households with exactly the same persons because it is improbable that two different households would agree in age distributions in 5-year categories. About 81 percent of the 445,426 households had the same 5-year category distribution. This is about 41 percent of all linked households. The agreement rate for linked households of the same size is substantially higher for the age group distribution with only three categories, 0-17, 18-64 and 65 and up due to the increased tolerance for reporting errors and the greater probability of chance agreement.  67   Table 23.

Based on the 5-year age group match for Census NRFU households, only about 19 percent of AREX households linked with Census 2000 NRFU households seemed to have exactly the same persons. As expected there is even less agreement in household characteristics between AREX and Census imputed households (Table 25).  69   Table 24.

For all census household sizes, AREX addresses were less likely to link with census multi-unit addresses than with single-unit addresses. For linked households of equal size, AREX differed from census in all demographic groups more often for households at multi-unit addresses. The difference in percentage of demographic agreement is about 12 percent for households of size 1 and in the neighborhood of 20 percent for households of sizes greater than 1. Deficiencies in administrative records coverage and timing of the extracts most likely explain the differences in demographic agreement.  71   Table 26.

It is possible that households containing only older people are less likely to move, and may yield better AREX to the census  72   comparisons. Table 27 provides address linkage rates by whether the housing unit is at multi-unit BSA, and by whether it has only people 50 and over. Table 28 provides comparisons of linkage rates, size, and demographics for housing units containing only people 50 and over, and others. (Tables B.16 and B.17A-B in Judson and Bauder (2002) contain similar comparisons for ages 18 and over, and for 65 and over.) The coverage by AREX of census households with everyone over 50 was slightly, but consistently, higher. This was true whether controlling for multi-units or controlling for size. The comparison for household size and demographics were much better for one and two person households with all members 50 and over. The demographic comparison was worse for households of size 3 or more, but there were few of those where all members were 50 and over. Table 27.

On the other hand, the household size comparisons and the racial composition comparisons display more disagreement for households with at least one person other than White. To some extent, this may be a consequence of race imputation that would have affected comparison of households with one or more persons other than White more often than all White households.  75   Table 29.

However, households with one or more Hispanics in the census were much less likely to match corresponding AREX households in size and Hispanic/non-Hispanic composition. Differences in household sizes were most likely due to deficiencies in administrative records coverage of Hispanics and the age of the  76   records vis--vis the Census. Differences in Hispanic composition within households of equal size were most likely due to the fact that Hispanic origin was model-based for virtually all AREX persons. Table 30.

The comparison was done with regard to the racial composition of the household. As expected, households with imputed race were less likely to agree on household race composition. Although the overall agreement rate of 86 percent was quite high when one or more members had imputed race, the agreement rate may have been much smaller when a member was imputed to be of an other race.

This would also provide a first look at the potential uses of administrative records data to substitute for some part of the nonresponse followup or unclassified households in a conventional census. Model Specification  For this initial model-building attempt, the units of analysis were all 889,638 one-to-one linked households. Separate equations for Census 2000 NRFU and unclassified households were not estimated, but dummy variables were included in the equation for these two types of decennial census household outcomes to see whether other predictor variables had accounted for differences in AREX/Census 2000 household similarity noticed in the descriptive analyses. This approach assumed that the regression hyperplanes for the three types of census households were parallel, an assumption that will be tested in future analyses. Also, the analysis reported here attempted to account for household size agreement and demographic composition simultaneously, providing in some sense, the net association between predictors and outcomes. However, it is possible that associations between predictors and household size agreement are different from associations with demographic similarity given agreement in size. This possibility will also be explored in future work. The functional form of the model is  y = ln  P(Match = 1 | x) = Logit(P(Match = 1 | x) = x P(Match = 0 | x)  where Match is a dichotomous dependent variable, x is a vector of regressors, and  is a vector of constants to be estimated. For each linked address, the dependent variable was defined as follows:  if the fully crossed age  race  sex  Hispanic origin distributions in the 1 Match =  linked Census household match the AREX household; 0 otherwise.   79   Predictor variables  The regressors, x, include characteristics of AREX addresses and households that would be available were data from administrative records to be used in support of a conventional census. The variable is dichotomous, taking on the value 1 if the characteristic is present and 0, otherwise. The interaction terms are products of the individual predictors. The predictors are numbered with the ""Row num"" in Table 34. The predictors were chosen after examination of an extensive set of bivariate crosstabulations with the dependent variable. The tabulations and associated discussion can be found in Judson and Bauder (2002). Address administrative records source files  Generally, it was assumed that addresses appearing in more than one administrative record source file would be less likely to represent a moving household than addresses found in only one file. Additionally households with addresses in Medicare files would largely represent older persons and represent stable households. The following variables pertain to the source of the ""best"" administrative records address. [10] In IRS file -- In the IRS 1040 file. [11] In IRMF file -- In the IRS Information Returns Master File (i.e. the 1099 file). [12] In Medicare file -- In the Medicare eligibility file [13] In IRS & IRMF --[10]*[11] [14] In IRS & MED -- [10]*[12] [15] In MED and IRMF -- [11]*[12] AREX Household characteristics  The following are characteristics of AREX households thought to be associated with same size and demographic similarity with the linked census households. To a certain extent, these variable are suggested by the descriptive analysis of the previous section, keeping in mind that the descriptive analysis often used census household characteristics rather than AREX household characteristics. [5] One or two persons -- Household contains only 1 or 2 persons. [6] No imputed race -- No household member has imputed race. [7] Hhold has children -- Household has one or more children under the age of 18.  80   [8] Hhold has 1+ White -- Household has one or more White members. [9] Hhold all age 65+ -- All members of the household are age 65 or over. [16] Age 65+ & One/two -- [5]*[9] [17] Age 65+ & 1+ White -- [8]*[9] [18] One/two & 1+ White -- [5]*[8] [19] 65+ & 1 or 2 & 1+ White -- [5]*[8]*[9] [21] 65+ and no imputed race -- [6]*[9] AREX/ DMAF address characteristics  Single unit addresses are assumed to be more predictable than multi-unit addresses. [4] Not multi unit  AREX indicates that the address is single unit. [20] 65+ and Not multiunit -- [4]*[9] [22] No imputed Race and not multi -- [4]*[6] [23] 65+ & No imp. & not multi -- [4]*[6]*[9] [1] Colorado effect -- AREX address is in Colorado Census 2000 response type  Including variables representing Census 2000 response type provides a first indication of whether separate models might be needed for each type. (The reference group is mailback respondents.) [2] Enumerator return -- NRFU respondent household [3] Imputed return -- Census 2000 whole house imputation Regression results  Although the regression results are useful in obtaining an initial understanding the relationships between AREX address and household characteristics and AREX/Census Match status, it is important to keep in mind that these matched households are not a nationally representative sample, that the analysis is exploratory in nature, and that  81   improvements in administrative records processing in the future will be substantial. Therefore, these results should be considered illustrative in nature. Table 32. Overall Response Profile for the ""Match"" Variable Response Profile and Overall Model Fit Statistics Match Status Demographics Match Demographics Do Not Match Total Frequency 342294 (38.5%) 547344 (61.5%)  About 38.5 percent of all linked addresses also matched on demographics.

The Likelihood Ratio test tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients except the intercept are zero in the population; Pr>ChiSq is the (nominal) probability of obtaining that Chi-Square value by chance; Because observations may not be I.I.D., standard errors may be understated and significance levels overstated. (Note is also applicable to Table 34 ).  All of the variables taken together significantly improved the prediction of Match status. The Pseudo R-Square value indicates that the model results in a 19 percent improvement in the log-likelihood over the null model of an intercept only. Coefficient estimates  Table 34 provides maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficients for the full model. The rightmost column indicates exponentiated coefficients, and can be interpreted as the (multiplicative) change in the odds of being a match given the corresponding characteristic, holding all other variables constant. An exponentiated coefficient of ""1""  82   indicates no effect, greater than 1 indicates positive effect, and less than 1 indicates negative effect. The presence of interaction terms makes the interpretation of individual coefficients somewhat difficult. Still, the results for AREX address and household characteristics seem generally as expected. AREX households that are smaller (one or two members), have only members aged 65+, have one or more Whites, and have no members with imputed race tend to be more likely to match the corresponding Census 2000 household. AREX households at single-unit addresses are more likely to match the census than those at multi-unit addresses. The negative coefficients on the Enumerator Return and Imputed Return indicate that these households remain less predictable other factors held constant. Separate equations for Census NRFU households might be required. Households where the census return was imputed are very unlikely to have the same demographics as their AREX counterparts and have added some noise to the coefficient estimates.  83   Table 34.

For example, the total effect of being captured in IRS, IRMF, and Medicare however, is effectively that the household is about 1.6 times more likely to demographically match. The effect of having all persons 65 or older, at least one White person, and consisting only of a one or two person household (given that the household is multi-unit and has at least one member with imputed race) is dramatically positive, 14.92. Similarly, a household having all persons 65 or older, not being a multiunit address, and having no imputation from the administrative records (but also other than white and more than two persons) is about four times more likely to match census demographics, holding other effects constant. Goodness of Fit  One way to evaluate the ability of the model to correctly predict household match status is to establish a decision rule that first chooses a probability level, c, and then deems an observation to be demographically matched if the probability that Match = 1 for that observation, calculated from the model, is greater than c. More succinctly, for a given level of c, 0  c  1, if P(Match=1|x)c, predict ""AREX household is demographically matched."" Otherwise predict that the household is not demographically matched. For a given probability level, there are several measures that can be used to evaluate the decision rule. Accuracy: Proportion of all cases correctly classified. False positive: Proportion of cases where the true match status is 0 given that the prediction is 1. False negative: Proportion of cases where the true match status is 1 given that the prediction is 0. Sensitivity: Proportion of cases where the prediction is 1 given that the true match status is 1. Specificity: Proportion of cases where the prediction is 0 given that the true match status is 0.  Table 35 shows the estimates of these quantities for decision rule probability levels between .5 and .9.  85   Table 35. Classification Results for Predicted Probabilities.

Dividing the sum of the correct predictions by the total number of cases above the 0.5 cutoff (about 889,000) gives 72.2 percent correct predictions (accuracy). Similarly, 54 percent of the matches were correctly predicted to be matches (sensitivity); 83.7 percent of the nonmatches were correctly predicted to be nonmatches (specificity); there was a 32.7 percent false positive rate and a 25.7 percent false negative rate. As the cutoff level, c, increases (i.e., becomes more stringent), the probability of making an error in deeming a match status of 1 above the cutoff (probability of a false positive) declines. For example at c=0.8, the number of correct predictions is 32,373 and the number of incorrect predictions is 6,546 for a total of 38,919. Thus the probability of a false positive is 6,546/38,919 = 0.168. As shown in the table, as c increases, the sensitivity and overall correctness decline, and specificity and the probability of a false negative increase. In order to evaluate cutoffs and their implications for goodness of fit, sensitivity and specificity, we present the following evaluative figures. Error! Reference source not found. provides an assessment of the goodness of fit of the obtained logit function against ""jittered"" outcomes. In this figure, the ordinate is the value of the logit function ln(p/1-p). A 10 percent sample of the 889,638 observations are plotted here. Each individual observation (a linked pair of addresses) is plotted as a point near zero or one. The points have been ""jittered"" slightly to simulate density and avoid overplotting. The abscissa is the predicted probability that an observation will be a match. If we choose 0.5 as our cutoff (so that we declare an observation a predicted match is P[match|XB]>0.5), then this corresponds to a logit value of zero, and the vertical line. The horizontal line at 0.5 is for reference. Points in the upper right hand quadrant are ""hits""--correct predictions that the demographics of the households match. Points in the lower left hand quadrant are also ""hits""--correct predictions that the demographics of the households will not match.  86   Points in the upper left hand and lower right hand quadrants are misses--incorrect predictions. Comparing the predicted logit function to the density of the obtained match outcomes assesses goodness of fit. (For more on the development and interpretation of this graph, see Judson, 1992. For more goodness of fit measures and graphics, see Judson and Bauder, 2002.)  Figure 18. Goodness of Fit Diagnostic Plot.  In thinking about using a regression model approach in deciding when to substitute an administrative records household for a nonresponse household in a conventional census, the probability of false match would have to be small, providing confidence that the household substitution was accurate and obviating the need for further enumeration. But the proportion of households in scope for substitution, that is, the proportion of households above the decision cutoff level would have to be large enough to provide substantial savings over face-to-face enumerations. For example, from Table 35, a cutoff of 0.8 would provide a relatively low probability of false negative, 0.168; but the  87   proportion of households in scope for substitution at that cutoff would be about 4 percent (38,919/889,638). Summary and conclusions General similarity between AREX data and Census data  A summary of the AREX to Census 2000 comparisons is given in Table 36. The overall coverage of occupied census housing units by AREX was about 84 percent (81 percent of occupied and vacant units). The coverage of census addresses by administrative records addresses could be raised substantially by resolving matches that were not one-to-one, by filling coverage gaps in administrative records, and by obtaining administrative records extracts at points in time closer to census day. Proposals for accomplishing all of these tasks are provided in Section 5 of this report. Similarity in size and demographic composition of linked AREX and census households was rather low. Of the occupied census linked households, AREX and the census had the same number of people in 52.1 percent of the cases (51.4 percent of all linked households). In 41.9 percent of occupied linked households, AREX and the census had the same number of people, and the same demographic distributions using the three broad age categories. About 81 percent of households had the same 5-year age distribution and about 93 percent had the same age distribution in the three broad groups. This suggests that the proportion of households of the same size that had exactly the same persons was somewhere in between. The relatively low percentage of households (80.5 percent) with similarity along all demographic dimensions was due in large part to race and Hispanic origin imputation and the difference in race categories between AREX and the census. It is unlikely that even improved race and Hispanic origin models will be sufficient, in themselves, for decennial census enumeration. Another approach is currently being developed. (See the discussion in Sections 4 and 5.) In summary, the key deficiency of the AREX administrative records processing was the failure to get the right number of people (and, therefore, the right people) at many of the addresses. Dissimilarity of households is of special concern for an AREX-type of design because of the limited opportunities to correct that part of the enumeration obtained from the administrative records. This will be the biggest challenge for future administrative records development.  88   Table 36. Summary of match rates and household comparisons between AREX and Census.

The address linkage rate for Census NRFU households was about 77 percent compared to 84 percent for non-NRFU households. For NRFU households, AREX and census agreement on the household size was 39 percent (57 percent for non-NRFU), and agreement on all demographic groups given agreement on size was 63 percent (85 percent for non-NRFU). These results suggest that substituting AREX households for NRFU households in a conventional census will be more difficult than matching households in general. It may be that households for which administrative records are weak overlap disproportionately with the Census NRFU population. However, it may also be the case that the characteristics of Census NRFU were more likely to be affected by AREX source file cutoffs and other AREX processing decisions than non-NRFU households. Also the Census 2000 enumeration of NRFU households may be less reliable. Similarity between AREX administrative records households and Census 2000 unclassified households was substantially weaker than with the NRFU households. This is not surprising since the census was least sure of the status of these addresses and the persons placed at them were imputed by the Census. AREX 2000 did not provide the information needed to assess whether using administrative records to enumerate census unclassified households would be more accurate than the imputation. Predicting household similarity  The logistic regression model predicted modestly well when AREX and census households matched demographically. Factors that predicted demographic matches included: one or two person households, households with exclusively older persons, households where members are captured by more than one administrative record system, households with no race imputation, and households that were at single-unit addresses. A decision rule that deemed matches resulted in correct match status in 72 about 33 percent. The most stringent to 16.8 percent, entailed only about 4 if predicted probability was above 50 percent percent of the cases but with a false positive rate of cutoff of 80 percent reduced the false positive rate percent of the household population.  90   4. DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 2010 PLANNING AND OTHER CENSUS BUREAU PROGRAMS  4.1 Additional AREX 2000 evaluations Assess the net impact of clerical and field Processes on the Bottom-up enumeration  There were originally four operations in AREX 2000 that were designed to improve administrative records addresses. MAFGOR was used to geocode city-style addresses that were not coded by computer. The RFPA was designed to obtain physical addresses for persons whose mailing addresses were non-city style or P.O. Box and geocode them. The clerical reviews following the initial match to the MAF and the FAV were designed to validate administrative record addresses that did not match the MAF. All of these operations were complex and labor intensive. It is not possible to evaluate each of the clerical and field operations separately because the AREX design did not vary these factors experimentally, and the RFPA results were not included in the AREX. Still it may be possible to gauge the net effect of the three operations on the Bottom-up results by stepping through the Bottom-up process excluding address information from any of the clerical or field operations and comparing the results to the Bottom-up enumeration. The impact of eliminating the MAFGOR, clerical review of the first DMAF match, and the FAV would be threefold. First, the effect of eliminating the three operations would be to decrease the number of persons enumerated from administrative records. Those persons at addresses that did not computer geocode, did not match the MAF through computer operations, or were found to be valid only by the FAV would be eliminated if their addresses were all of these types. Second, selected addresses for some individuals enumerated from administrative records would change because their current Bottom-up address would be eliminated leaving some other address still acceptable to the Bottom-up process. Finally, because the total number of acceptable administrative record addresses would be smaller, there would be more non-matched DMAF records to canvass in order to complete the enumeration. That is, the number of addresses brought in by the Census Pull, simulating the canvassing, would be larger. In broad terms, eliminating the results of the three address improvement operations would require the following steps:  Recreate the address lists available to the Bottom-up by removing all addresses that were in the original list due to any of the three operations. (Because the new address list is a subset of the original list, an additional match to the DMAF for tabulation block codes should not be required. This ignores the possibility that a MAFGOR coded address might have picked up a block code from the DMAF); Recreate the Bottom-up composite person records by matching the smaller set of addresses to the individuals and reapplying the address selection rules; and,    91     Rematch to the Census 2000 HDF in the AREX sites and include persons at unmatched HDF addresses.  There are a number of ways that this alternative process could be evaluated. First, the alternative Bottom-up counts could be compared with the Census 2000 using methodology similar to that of Section 3. The purpose would be to test if basic enumeration results were different from those of the original Bottom-up process. Matching the two sets of Bottom-up results person by person could make a more extensive analysis. This would permit an analysis of (1) persons lost completely to the Bottom-up as a result of dropping the address operations, (2) persons whose address changed within the site, (3) persons omitted from administrative records counts who were picked up at additional Census Pull addresses, and (4) new Census Pull persons not in the first AREX Bottom-up results. Of course, a person-to-person match would require substantial work. The methodology used by Wagner (2002) in matching the Numident to the Census 2000 HCUF may provide a useful approach. Finally, there could be analyses that focus on the addresses rather than the persons. Address analyses could address the administrative records sources of rejected addresses, the impact of rejected addresses on address selection, and a comparison of addresses for persons omitted from the administrative records counts but who showed up in the Census Pull. In the latter, it might be important to understand why the Census Pull address was not obtained from administrative records address selection. Adding AREX vacants and unduplicating Bottom-up results  In addition to comparing the two Bottom-up processes described above, consideration should be given to creating two additional Bottom-up enumerations based on proposals offered in the Bottom-up evaluation in Section 3: (1) adding the vacant AREX addresses to the Census Pull if they matched the HDF, and (2) unduplicating individuals between the Census Pull and the administrative records. This pair of Bottom-up enumerations would appear to be more correct than the corresponding pair without these additional operations. Repeating AREX 2000 with StARS 2000 without clerical or field operations  If eliminating the clerical address operations, as discussed in Section 2, turns out to be relatively inconsequential, then there would be great value in ""repeating"" the AREX Bottom-up process (without the clerical address operations) and the statistical evaluations with StARS 2000. The reason is that the administrative records data sets used in StARS 2000 are much closer to those that might be available in an actual administrative records census than those of StARS 1999 (putting aside the possibility of additional administrative records sources). Having the results from this administrative records  92   baseline will be important in planning for AREX 2010 because the test items will not be confounded with the timing problems due to the administrative records extract dates in StARS 1999. Since the purpose of redoing the Bottom-up would not be primarily to compare with the StARS 1999 results, operational improvements, such as improved SSN validation for IRS files that have been incorporated into StARS 2000 would be appropriate. The StARS 2000 AREX should include DMAF matched AREX vacant addresses in the Census Pull, and there should be unduplication after it. Also, the more timely administrative records would provide an opportunity to take a new look at the address selection algorithm, redirecting the emphasis to choosing the address that best reflects residence as of Census Day and away from the somewhat artificial focus on the presence of block codes. Using the StARS 2000 files does not resolve two of the major limitations on the AREX: the handling of special populations, and race and Hispanic origin measurement. For the latter, consideration should be given to using Wagner's race and Hispanic origin data (2002). Although this is somewhat circular; again, it might provide results that are much closer to what would have been achieved in an actual census. Correct handling of special populations may need to await future experiments. Analysis of administrative records coverage gaps 11  In this report, a number of coverage gaps in administrative records for both adults and children have been identified; but the population sizes and characteristics of the missing persons is not known precisely. A linkage of StARS to a Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) or Current Population Survey (CPS) sample for a corresponding time period would provide some information about the characteristics of persons in the survey who were not found in the administrative records. The linkage could be easily accomplished using the SSNs developed for those surveys, and using probabilistic methods for those without SSNs. The subsequent analysis would not provide a complete look at the non-covered population because of coverage deficiencies in the survey, itself, both in terms of segments of the population underrepresented and persons in the survey sample for whom SSNs are not available. Still, much could be learned about the adults and children not found in the administrative record systems. A SIPP linkage might be particularly useful for missing adults because it would identify the government programs in which they are participating and provide details about social and economic circumstances. For households in which adults have been matched but not all of the children, a key focus might be to identify the administrative records characteristics of the adults who then might become an additional special population for administrative records census purposes. That is, these households might receive a special mailing in order to obtain a more complete enumeration of the household in AREX 2010.  11  Suggestions for additional administrative records acquisitions are given in Bye, 2002, section 5.  93   4.2  Race and Hispanic Origin enhanced Numident  Improved modeling of race and Hispanic origin for administrative records will not provide a general solution to decennial census measurement for two reasons. First, it is unlikely that the models can provide adequate fit for the most difficult to measure groups such as American Indians and Alaskan Natives, Hawaii Islanders, and persons classifying themselves as multi-race. Second, even the best models will always suffer from a lack of fit in small geographic areas due to variation in local responses about model predicted averages. Looking ahead to 2010, it is important to continue to annotate the Numident with survey reported race and Hispanic origin in order to make the annotated Numident as complete as possible. The American Community Survey (ACS) would be a major source of ongoing updates, under full implementation. Because there will always be a residual subset of the Numident for which survey responses to race and Hispanic origin are not available, there will continue to be a need for race and Hispanic origin models. The methods proposed here make that subset smaller and smaller. The initial task of annotating the Census Numident with race and Hispanic origin from Census 2000 was described briefly in Section 4, and an ongoing process to fill in the remaining gaps in the Numident was proposed. There are some research activities that should be considered in connection with this process. Evaluation of the initial match  First, the accuracy of the Numident/Census match should be evaluated, perhaps by manual examination of a sample of matched cases. Bye (1999) estimated very high accuracy for a similar matching process between the SSA Numident and a pair of ACS test sites. His results suggest that an evaluation sample need not be large and should be stratified by strong and weak stages of the matching operation with the largest part of the sample coming disproportionately from the weakest areas. Second, the extent to which the initial match covers a typical administrative records population should be explored. Finally, the possibility of augmenting the initial match between the Numident and the Census should be explored.  94   Analysis of response variance over time in reported race and Hispanic origin  One purpose of continuing to annotate the Numident with race and Hispanic origin after the initial match to Census 2000 is to make the annotated Numident as complete as possible and to have race reports as current as possible for use in 2010 and the intervening years. A second purpose would be to study the response variation in self reports over time comparing the Census 2000 measures to those obtained in later years from other surveys. Although the reason for observed changes would be confounded somewhat by differences in mode of administration of the questions (hopefully the categories would remain unchanged), an analysis of the frequency and nature of reported differences would permit an assessment of the efficacy of using reported race or Hispanic origin reported at previous times. It would also be useful to be able to compare change over time with simple response variance if the latter measurement is available from reinterviews in past censuses or surveys. New race and Hispanic origin models  However the enhancement of the Numident is carried out, there will always be a need for models to impute race and Hispanic origin to the residual of persons enumerated from administrative records whose Numident record was not enhanced. In such cases, the models developed by Bye (1998), and Bye and Thompson (1999) should be discarded, and new models should be estimated from the enhanced Numident itself. The enhanced Numident would provide very large samples with race measurement in the correct format, a situation nonexistent prior to its creation.  4.3 Household substitution for NRFU/Unclassified households in 2010 Although the results were not convincingly strong, due largely to the limitations on AREX 2000, the idea of substituting administrative records households for NRFU or unclassified households in a conventional census merits further consideration. For NRFU households there is the potential for significant cost savings, and for unclassified households, the potential for greater accuracy than that provided by imputation. The general methodology of household substitution reported in Section 3 was a two-step approach: Address linkage followed by household substitution in cases with a high probability of correct household membership. This approach should be tested as part of the 2004 Census Test using models developed from a linkage of StARS 2000 data to the Census 2000 HDF. The timing of the administrative records in StARS 2000 would be much closer to Census Day than the StARS 1999 data used in AREX 2000, and much more like the data that would be available in 2010. Of course, similar administrative data would have to be available in 2004, the year of the Census Test.  95   Household level research  The immediate focus of household-level research would be in connection of the AREX Bottom-up using StARS 2000. For this test enumeration, it important to assess the accuracy of the households formed from the more administrative records using the same kinds of descriptive and regression were applied to the original AREX data set.  with the repeat will be current analyses that  Redoing the household-level analysis using AREX results based on StARS 2000 would give a more accurate assessment of the ability of administrative records to recreate Census households without the handicap of the time lag resulting from the use of StARS 1999. With these more current data, it would be more reasonable to focus the analysis on exact person matches between households and not demographic matches. There are several advantages to using exact person matches. First, it is the most simple in concept: How often and under what circumstances can households be obtained from administrative records that are the same as those in the census? Simply put, when do we get the same people? Second, the person match would remove the emphasis on race and Hispanic origin and the problems that imputation introduced into the previous analysis. Although determining when two groups of persons are matched is more difficult than matching demographic patterns, exact person matching would rely primarily on name and date of birth; and race and Hispanic origin would be minor match keys if used at all. ARRS now has much experience in person matching. Third, with exact person matching, analyses can be done of ""true"" near misses by the administrative records. For example, for households with different numbers of persons, dependent variables could be constructed that indicate that all of the AREX persons were contained in the Census household except for 1 (or 2) and vice versa. Not only might these kinds of misses be acceptable in certain future applications, but also studying the characteristics of the missing persons may suggest improvements for administrative records sources or processing.  NRFU and/or imputed households substitution  The possibility of substituting administrative records households for NRFU households should be explored using StARS 2000 data matched to Census 2000. The data would come naturally from a StARS 2000 AREX as discussed above or could be developed separately if the StARS 2000 AREX is not done. The StARS 2000 dual process would  96   supply the unduplicated individuals and a set of addresses for each individual to which an address selection rule would be applied. Administrative record persons assembled by final addresses would then be matched to Census 2000 in more or less the same way as it was done in the AREX to produce a data set for analysis. The one major difference between a data processing operation focused on substitution and a full enumeration is that block tabulations would not be required in the substitution approach. The sample could be limited to the AREX test sites; but if resources permit, representative samples of the full population of administrative records should be used. The dependent variable could be analogous to that used above--a dichotomous variable indicating an exact household match or not. But other more lenient variables such as those suggested above (e.g., all persons are the same except one) might be used if they represent alternatives that might be used in 2010. If an adequate model for NRFU or imputed household substitution can be obtained from the StARS 2000 records, the results could be used in a 2010 Census test, scheduled for 2004 and 2006. Assuming that the 2004 test is successful, it raises the question of what data would be used to construct the model that would actually be used in 2010.  4.4 Person unduplication in the 2010 Census It is known that developing unduplication techniques that have a solid operational and statistical foundation is no small task. There are two difficult parts of person unduplication, in particular long-range unduplication. The first is determining that in fact the two enumeration records are a duplicate. The second is determining which duplicate record should be ""preferred"" with respect to geographical location (and, implicitly, which is an erroneous enumeration). For the first problem (duplicate detection), methods have been developed by the Census Bureau for finding candidate duplicate pairs. By adding the administrative records data from the NUMIDENT file onto the source data files, we gain a powerful field (the Protected Identification Key, or PIK) for confirming that the candidate duplicate pairs are indeed duplicates. This confirmation function has the direct effect of reducing followup workload. Results from Bean and Bauder (2002) clearly demonstrate this effect: 86.7 percent of the duplicates proposed by an enhanced ""Further Study of Person Duplication"" operation were confirmed using administrative records data. The second difficult problem (geographical location) continues to be a challenge. While we expect only a modest benefit in using administrative records data to make the geographic placement decision, we really do not have any hard data to address the question. Research should determine just how big this ""modest"" benefit is, and its costsaving implications.  97   4.5 MAF improvement Many of the administrative records obtained by the Census Bureau include addresses for the people on those records. One result of building the Statistical Administrative Records System (StARS) database each year is a MAF-like list of these addresses, many of which are geocoded to census blocks. This list, the StARS Master Housing File (MHF), is, except for geocoding, constructed independently of the MAF and can thus help to evaluate and improve the MAF by:    Providing small area tallies to compute MAF quality metrics Providing a comprehensive, accurate and timely source of data for change detection Assisting with targeting of counties or other areas for updating purposes  Other administrative records could also be useful to identify newly constructed housing units or areas where new construction is occurring but not yet complete. The national scope of StARS combined with its precise geography make it very flexible in assisting with the completion of the objectives of the MAF/TIGER Enhancement program and meeting the needs of other programs. Duplicate and multiple MAF IDs  Multiple MAFIDs assigned to a single address and duplicate MAFIDs assigned to multiple addresses contributed substantially to the difficulty in matching administrative records addresses to the DMAF and in classifying addresses as matched, non-matched, or possibly matched for subsequent address operations. These problems were compounded in the experiment because of the need for a second match to the DMAF to transform ""collection"" geographic codes to ""tabulation"" geographic codes. Address record linkage techniques  The 81 percent link rate between administrative records addresses and the Census 2000 HDF, reported in the Household-level analysis, was somewhat lower than expected. In particular, as many as 10 percent of administrative records addresses that matched the HDF did not match on a one-to-one basis. Improvements in address editing and standardization and in developing tools for address record linkage across databases have the potential to yield significant benefits in increasing linkage rates. At the same time, the AREX did not provide an assessment of falsely linked addresses and their characteristics. Thus research needs to be done on both sides of the linkage issue in order to insure improved linkage of administrative records addresses in the future.  98   4.6 Other Census Bureau programs SSN verification and search  The successful development of SSN verification and search methodology by ARRS is one of the most valuable results of administrative record research. Unduplication of persons in administrative records is a crucial step in the development of StARS/AREX enumerations. The unduplication is based largely on the SSN; and therefore, availability and correctness of the SSNs in administrative records is crucial to the process. Bye (1997) provided a discussion of SSN verification approaches in the context of an administrative records census. In addition to decennial census applications, there are a variety of applications in connection with administrative records linkage with Census surveys. These include SSN verification and search for surveys that collect SSNs from respondents such as the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Current Population Survey. Additionally, the applications include SSN search for respondents in surveys in which the SSN is not requested, such as the American Community Survey. SSN verification and search methodology consists of direct searches of the Census Numident matching name and date of birth and indirect searches that use address information in administrative records to identify possible SSNs for persons at survey addresses. Probabilistic record linkage software is used to associate data reported in surveys with Numident data in order to establish ownership of the SSNs. More information about these methods and applications can be found in Bye (1999). Intercensal estimates program  In demographic applications, early evaluations of the StARS 1999 and 2000 files versus Census 2000 and existing estimates strongly suggest that StARS data have the potential to be a useful ""check"" on existing cohort-component, ratio, and the so-called ""administrative records"" estimation method (not to be confused with StARS itself). Because StARS has the potential to be updated on a year-by-year basis, this ""check"" is likely to be particularly important in the later years of the decade. Two lines of research appear promising: StARS contributing to total population estimates at the county level, and contributing to Age/Race/Sex/Hispanic Origin Estimates at the county level: Age/Race/Sex/Hispanic origin estimates are particularly important component of the total estimates program, because they serve as important control totals to ongoing surveys.  99   As the decade past a decennial census proceeds, population estimates based on the decennial census and proceeding forward begin to degrade in quality as local population changes deviate from that expected. The administrative records databases, however, provide an annual ""snapshot"" for county and possibly incorporated city level estimates. While this snapshot might be slightly inaccurate in level, the year over year change in the snapshot could provide an important ""check"" on existing population estimates. One significant strength of the StARS system is that many of its addresses have been geocoded to Census Blocks, even specific Master Address File (MAF) identifiers. Using StARS data in a synthetic fashion, and using the explosion in techniques for small area estimation, we can consider generating total population estimates at tract, block group or even block levels. These estimates can then feed back into survey frames, ACS controls, and the like.  Improving Current Surveys  A related use is to use administrative records data to improve noninterview weighting for nonresponse in surveys; this also requires matching and substitution or modeling. Currently, for ongoing survey noninterviews, noninterview adjustment ""cells"" are constructed by identifying limited aspects of the noninterview household. For these cells, a noninterview adjustment factor is calculated. However, with the administrative records data bases (StARS) covering the entire country, perhaps improvements can be made. Two different approaches should be tested: Noninterview adjustment cell construction, and direct imputation modeling, each using administrative records data.  100   REFERENCES Aguirre International (1995).

StARS Process Steps  Outline The process steps outline that follows is a synthesized extract from pertinent StARS 1999 programming specifications. The outline is presented here to assist in understanding the complex nature (at a high level) of the operations required to build the StARS database. For a more detailed description of the processes, refer to the StARS specifications available from the Administrative Records Research Staff. In outline format, the ""dualstream"" processing steps in the creation of the StARS 1999 database are as follows: 1. Edit and standardize address data from the national-level source files. a. Combine all records and split resulting file into 1000 ZIP Code cuts in preparation for the Code-1 process. b. Pass records through Code-1 to standardize and ""clean"" the address data. c. Unduplicate the address records and create the GEO Extract File. 1) Unduplicate on exact match of all address fields (full 9-digit ZIP Code). 2) Extract file contains minimum number of data fields for TIGER coding. 2. Edit and standardize person demographic data from national-level files. a. Name edits and standardization designed to enable record matching, linking, and unduplication within the database once SSNs are verified. b. Split and sort records into Census Numident segments by Social Security Number (SSN) in preparation for SSN Search and Verification (S&V) phase of StARS. 3. Verify and validate SSNs by matching and comparing name data, date-of-birth data, and gender information against the Census Numident using AutoMatch. a. Pass unverified SSNs through ""name/date-of birth search"" phase using AutoMatch. b. Differing match cut-off scores and weights established for each source file. c. Use Census Numident data to fill missing demographic input data. Demographic data (other than name fields) for all IRS records derived from Census Numident. d. Person records now ready for re-link to the geocoded address records. 4. Create the Master Housing File (MHF) as follows: a. Pass the ABI commercial file through Code-1 and the address standardizer to format and ""clean"" commercial addresses. b. Unduplicate ABI file (exact match of parsed fields), and assign address type. c. Pass Geocoded files through the address standardizer to obtain parsed address fields in preparation for record unduplication. 1) Assign address type based on standardized return fields. 2) Unduplicate GEO files based on exact match of parsed fields within type. d. Merge unduplicated Geocoded file with unduplicated ABI file to identify and flag commercial addresses within each 3-digit ZIP Code file.  105   1) Assign a Housing Unit Identification Number (HUID). 2) HUID provides a numeric variable indicator to assist in selection of the best address for output to the final StARS database (the CPR). e. Update the Master Pointer File (MPF) to enable address linkage back to original source files. MPF also reflects number of duplicate addresses associated with each address selected for retention on the MHF. f. Merge the MHF and MPF and split resulting file back to original source cuts. 1) Select only the ""current"" address from Selective Service Records 2) Merge split files with source Proxy Files to append proxy addresses and create Enhanced Master Pointer File. 5. Create Linked Person Files a. Use ""direct access"" method to link person records with Enhanced Master Pointer File. b. UID variable identifies the correct EMPF source file to access for selecting required geographic data for inclusion on Linked Person File. c. Link unverified SSN records in the same fashion. 6. Create the Composite Person Record (CPR) by selecting the ""best record"" from the Linked Person Files as follows: a. Invoke address selection rules to determine the best address for the person records.

GX252-37-15673032	"Report of the Executive Steering Committee for Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Policy on Adjustment for Non-Redistricting Uses  October 17, 2001   Recommendation The Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) recommended on March 1, 2001 that unadjusted census data be used for redistricting. After assessing considerable new evidence, ESCAP now recommends that unadjusted Census 2000 data also be used for nonredistricting purposes. The effect of this new evidence is that the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) overstated the net undercount by at least 3 million persons. The cause of this error was that the A.C.E. failed to measure a significant number of census erroneous enumerations, many of which were duplicates. This level of error in the A.C.E. measurement of net coverage is such that the A.C.E. results cannot be used in their current form. This finding of substantial error, in conjunction with remaining uncertainties, necessitates that revisions, based on additional review and analysis, be made to the A.C.E. estimates before any potential uses of these data can be considered. The Census Bureau will release the remaining Census 2000 data products, post-censal estimates, and survey controls using unadjusted data. It is, however, reasonable to expect that further research and analysis may lead to revised A.C.E. estimates that can be used to improve future post-censal estimates. The ESCAP review confirmed the finding in the first ESCAP Report that most Census 2000 and A.C.E. operations were of high quality. The evaluations continue to demonstrate that improvements were achieved over both the 1990 census and the 1990 coverage measurement survey. Important new information and methods are now available for assessing the A.C.E. and Census 2000. As will be discussed in more detail below, final analysis of this new information is still in progress. However, the Census Bureau believes that this analysis will confirm that Census 2000 made substantial gains in reducing the total net undercount, as well as reducing net differential undercount. Most of the A.C.E. operations were also seen to be well conducted, producing valuable information that, when combined with the other evaluation findings, provides important new research data. The ESCAP feels confident that its research program will enhance the evaluations of Census 2000, contribute to planning for the 2010 census, and, with further analysis, potentially improve future the post-censal estimates. The ESCAP's primary concern in its March decision was that fundamental differences between the Demographic Analysis (DA) estimates and the A.C.E. estimates could not be explained. The estimates differed widely, both for the total national population and for important population groups. The Committee investigated this inconsistency extensively but could not adequately explain it in the time available for the March decision. The Committee concluded in March that the inconsistency must have resulted from one or more of three possible scenarios. The first scenario was that all available 1990 census data, including the census results, the coverage measurement survey, and the demographic analysis estimates, significantly understated the Nation's population, but that Census 2000 found this previously un-enumerated population. The second scenario was that demographic analysis underestimated population growth between 1990 and 2000. The third scenario was that the A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's population, raising the possibility of an undiscovered problem in the A.C.E. or census methodology. The Census Bureau's extensive research over the past eight months has been directed at examining demographic analysis, the A.C.E., and Census 2000. Demographic analysis research examined historic levels of the components of population change to address the possibility that 1   the 1990 demographic analysis estimates understated the national population (the first scenario). This analysis did not reveal any significant problems. The Census Bureau investigated the second scenario by revising the preliminary estimates of international migration, and hence the foreign-born population, using actual Census 2000 long form data. The Census Bureau also consulted with outside experts on this work. These studies resulted in revisions to the ""Base DA"" that was initially examined as part of the March 2001 decision. The revisions reflected a larger growth in the foreign-born population during the last decade. The current revised demographic analysis estimates are much closer to the Alternative DA considered during the March deliberations. The A.C.E. and demographic analysis evaluations, when analyzed together, explain many of the inconsistencies. With regard to the third scenario, the ESCAP's review of the accuracy of the A.C.E. and Census 2000 was based on a number of evaluation studies, including reinterview studies, re-processing studies, and computer searches for duplicate enumerations. This research found that the A.C.E. did not account for a large number of Census 2000 duplicates, leading to an overstatement of the Census 2000 net undercount. As described previously, this finding, in conjunction with the revisions to demographic analysis, explains to a large degree the discrepancies between the A.C.E. and demographic analysis. The significance of the error in the A.C.E. treatment of duplicates compels the recommendation that the current A.C.E. estimates cannot be used to adjust the Census 2000 data. The ESCAP notes that its extensive evaluation program has provided information that was unavailable for previous decennial censuses. This important new information was the result of outstanding and innovative work on the part of many Census Bureau employees. Additionally, the Committee notes that some of the information resulted from new methodologies not available in prior censuses. Census 2000 was the first census to capture name information in a way that permits nationwide computer matching. The evaluation results, including the new tool of name matching, will be extremely valuable for evaluating the accuracy of Census 2000, planning for the 2010 census, and potentially for improving future post-censal estimates. Both census taking and coverage measurement are processes that evolve and improve with each census. The Census 2000 experience will help refine both census and coverage measurement processes for future censuses. While the ESCAP has recommended against use of the adjusted data, the A.C.E.'s original objective of addressing the differential undercount must still be pursued. The totality of the evidence considered by the Committee leads it to believe that while Census 2000 successfully lowered the historical pattern of the differential undercount, it did not eliminate it. The Census Bureau believes that the net undercount remains disproportionately distributed among renters and minority populations. With further research, it is reasonable to expect that new information can be used to produce revised A.C.E. estimates. These revised estimates may then be employed to improve post-censal population estimates by reducing remaining differential coverage error. It is also expected that planning for the 2010 census will greatly benefit from these findings, with improved operations to identify and remove duplicates and refined methods to improve the accuracy of all census operations. The Census Bureau will continue research to design improved operations, including coverage measurement studies, for future censuses and surveys.  2   Executive Summary After assessing considerable new evidence, the second ESCAP Committee (ESCAP II) has recommended that unadjusted Census 2000 data also be used for non-redistricting purposes. New evidence indicates that the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) overstated the net undercount by at least 3 million persons, and that the cause of this error was the A.C.E.'s failure to measure a significant number of census erroneous enumerations, many of which were duplicates. This level of error in the A.C.E. measurement of net coverage is such that the A.C.E. results cannot be used in their current form. This finding of substantial error, in conjunction with remaining uncertainties, necessitates that revisions, based on additional review and analysis, be made to the A.C.E. estimates before any potential uses of these data can be considered. The Census Bureau will release the remaining Census 2000 data products, post-censal estimates, and survey controls using unadjusted data. It is, however, reasonable to expect that further research and analysis may lead to revised A.C.E. estimates that can be used to improve future post-censal estimates. ESCAP II has also confirmed the finding in the first ESCAP Report that most Census 2000 and A.C.E. operations were of high quality. More recent evaluations continue to demonstrate that improvements were achieved over both the 1990 census and the 1990 coverage measurement survey. Important new information and methods are now available for assessing the A.C.E. and Census 2000. As will be discussed in more detail below, final analysis of the effects of this new information is still in progress. However, the Census Bureau believes that this analysis will confirm that Census 2000 made substantial gains in reducing the total net undercount, as well as the net differential undercount. Most of the A.C.E. operations were also seen to be well conducted, producing valuable information that, when combined with the other evaluation findings, provides important new research data. The ESCAP feels confident that the Census Bureau's continuing research program will enhance the evaluations of Census 2000, contribute to planning for the 2010 census, and, with further analysis, potentially improve the post-censal estimates. The ESCAP's primary concern in its March decision was that demographic analysis and the A.C.E. estimates differed widely, both for the total national population and for important population groups. The Committee concluded in March that the inconsistency must have derived from one or more of three possible scenarios. The first scenario was that all available 1990 census data, including the 1990 census, the 1990 coverage measurement survey, and the 1990 demographic analysis estimates significantly understated the Nation's population, while Census 2000 included portions of this previously un-enumerated population. The second scenario was that demographic analysis estimates underestimated population growth between 1990 and 2000. The third scenario was that the A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's population, raising the possibility of an undiscovered problem with the A.C.E. or census methodology. The ESCAP also identified additional technical concerns that are documented in the previous report.  Areas of Research In the months since the ESCAP I Report, the Committee embarked on a second round of deliberations to address the concerns identified in the report and to enable the Census Bureau to i   recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for future uses. The future uses in consideration included the post-censal population estimates, demographic survey controls, and the production of Census 2000 long form data products. The ESCAP I Committee did not have current results for certain measures of A.C.E. accuracy, and was forced to use 1990 data on potential A.C.E. errors. The ESCAP therefore directed and documented that a number of evaluations be conducted to inform the deliberations. Some of the evaluations were designed to provide current measures of accuracy for the various components of error. These evaluations involved additional technical research, field work, and data processing, as well as new computer matching and simulation research. The evaluations include:  Demographic Analysis (DA) Research The DA research program examined historical levels of the components of population change to address the possibility that the 1990 DA estimates understated the Nation's population and that demographic analysis did not capture the full population growth in the last decade. The Census Bureau consulted with outside demographic experts to plan and conduct its research program, focusing on the methodologies and underlying estimates of the components of population change. The research activities concentrated on two major areas  international migration and the robustness of the DA estimates.  Measurement of Erroneous Enumerations, Including Duplication Erroneous enumerations refer to individuals who should not be included in the census counts because they are duplicated, fictitious, or live someplace other than where they were enumerated. While the ESCAP I Report did not identify erroneous enumerations as an area of concern, Census Bureau researchers quickly noted that Census 2000 erroneous enumerations differed substantially from 1990 measures in ways that were not readily understood. Studies included the Measurement Error Reinterview/ Evaluation Followup (hereinafter called the EFU) and the Person Duplication Studies. EFU results were used to determine how well the A.C.E identified erroneous enumerations. The EFU was based on a reinterview of a sample drawn from the A.C.E. clusters. The Person Duplication Studies used computer matching techniques to identify Census 2000 duplicate enumerations throughout the United States, and to determine whether the A.C.E. estimates had correctly accounted for these duplications. These studies used computer matching methods not available in earlier censuses.  Measurement of Census Omissions Census omissions refer to individuals who should have been counted in the census but were not. The A.C.E. methodology must accurately account for both erroneous enumerations, as described above, and census omissions. The A.C.E. identifies omissions by matching an independent sample to the census. The accuracy of this measurement of omissions thus depends on the accuracy of the matching, as well as the accuracy of the information collected by the independent sample. Census omissions were evaluated in the Matching Error Study, in which expert matchers re-matched a sample of the A.C.E. to determine the accuracy of the A.C.E. matching process. Omissions were also evaluated in the EFU described above to measure the accuracy of the A.C.E. information on Census Day residence, including whether persons had moved since Census Day. ii   Missing Data Studies Missing data occurs in the A.C.E. if, after all attempts, there remain persons for whom complete data are not available, including demographic characteristics such as age or race. Missing data also includes the status of whether a person matched, was a resident on Census Day, or was correctly enumerated. The latter types of missing data can seriously affect the accuracy of coverage measurement surveys such as the A.C.E. The A.C.E. used a statistical model to account for the effects of missing data. The ESCAP directed the development of alternative missing data models to assess the effect on the estimates of using different assumptions to predict the effects of missing data.  Balancing Error The previous ESCAP report indicated concerns with balancing error. Balancing error occurs when the method used to determine the number of omissions is different from the method used to determine which records are correctly included in the census. The specific concern was that the area for matching to find omissions was different from the area used to determine erroneous enumerations. The ESCAP posited various scenarios that could explain the concerns with balancing error, ranging from small to very serious effects on the A.C.E. estimates. In order to investigate these concerns, additional field operations were conducted.  Synthetic Error Study The A.C.E. estimation methodology produced estimated coverage correction factors which were carried down within the post-strata in a process referred to as synthetic estimation. The key assumption underlying synthetic estimation is that net census coverage is relatively uniform within the post-strata. Failure of this assumption leads to synthetic error. The Census Bureau is concerned with synthetic error since it may affect the accuracy of small area estimates and cannot be directly estimated. ESCAP I examined the effects of synthetic error by studying ""artificial populations,"" populations created with surrogate variables that are known for the entire population, and are developed to reflect the distribution of net coverage error. ESCAP II directed the preparation of additional artificial populations.  Evaluation Results Demographic analysis research examined historical levels of the components of population change to address the possibility that the 1990 demographic analysis estimates understated the national population (the first scenario). This analysis did not reveal any significant problems. The Census Bureau investigated the second scenario by revising the estimates of international migration using preliminary Census 2000 long form data, and estimates of the numbers of births, using more current assumptions about birth registration. The Census Bureau also consulted with outside experts on this work. This analysis resulted in revisions to the Base DA that was initially examined as part of the ESCAP I decision. The revisions reflected a larger growth in the foreign-born population during the last decade. The current Revised DA estimates considered by ESCAP II are much closer to the Alternative DA considered during the ESCAP I deliberations. Many of the inconsistencies previously noted are removed when the Revised DA estimates are iii   viewed in light of the A.C.E. evaluations. The Revised DA national estimate of 281.8 million for the U.S. resident population is 2.2 million higher than the Base DA and about 0.6 million lower than the Alternative DA. The Revised DA net undercount rate of 0.12 percent compares to a net overcount of 0.65 percent implied by the Base DA, and a net undercount of 0.32 percent using the Alternative DA.  Erroneous Enumerations The studies examining the accuracy of the measurement of erroneous enumerations initially found serious errors that would have resulted in a large overstatement of the population by the A.C.E. The seriousness of these findings prompted the Committee to direct further work to make sure that the findings were correct. This additional review indicated that a significant problem existed with the measurement of erroneous enumerations, but also indicated that the study findings were subject to uncertainties resulting from a large number of cases left unresolved or conflicting. The Person Duplication Studies added additional information underscoring the seriousness of the errors in measuring erroneous enumerations. These duplication studies found that the A.C.E. had seriously understated the level of erroneous enumerations because of incompletely measuring census duplications, and that the EFU had not accounted for a significant part of this understatement. They also helped to explain some of the uncertainty that arose from the rework of the EFU. The net effect of these studies was the conclusion that the A.C.E. overstated the level of undercount by at least 3 million persons. The level of this error is such that the ESCAP determined that the unadjusted data should be used.  Census Omissions With regard to studies of census omissions, the Matching Error Study indicated that the A.C.E. overstated the net undercount due to P-sample matching error by about 385,000. The EFU indicated that a substantial number of movers were changed to nonmovers and vice versa. The net effect of these mover status changes suggests an overestimate of the match rate and therefore an understatement in the A.C.E. estimates of about 450,000. At the national level there is therefore a small net effect of about 65,000 on the accuracy of the measurement of census omissions. However, more research must be conducted to further study these effects.  Missing Data The Committee examined a variety of alternative models to account for the effects of missing data. These models gave a wide range of results, implying widely varying effects on the A.C.E. estimates. The data examined by the Committee make clear that alternative missing data models both understated and overstated the effects of missing data on the A.C.E. estimates, depending on the choice of model. The Committee ultimately viewed the choice of model as an increase in the uncertainty associated with the A.C.E. results, but did not find evidence of bias resulting from this choice of model. This uncertainty should be considered in further analysis of the A.C.E. estimates.  iv   Balancing Error ESCAP I's concern with balancing error has for the most part been resolved, as further research indicated that the previously observed discrepancy did not appreciably influence the A.C.E. estimates.  Total Error Model ESCAP I used a total error model to consolidate its research and to produce an overall assessment of A.C.E. accuracy. ESCAP II directed that an updated model be prepared to account for information from the new evaluation studies. The timing of some of the new evaluations, along with the complexities of both the studies and the A.C.E. design, did not allow preparation of an updated model that would incorporate all errors that impact the A.C.E. estimates. As discussed more fully in the body of the report, the ESCAP could not develop or verify a new total error model that would take into account all of the errors discovered in the EFU, Matching Error Study, and Person Duplication Studies. Even without the information from an updated total error model, however, it was clear to the Committee that the magnitude of the discovered errors precluded a recommendation in favor of the adjusted data.  Synthetic Error Consideration of the synthetic error studies requires the completion of the total error model and will be included in the continued research.  Other Concerns Additional studies allayed other concerns about the A.C.E. and the census. Studies revealed no evidence of significant contamination bias. The Committee concluded that the effect of excluding reinstated census people from the A.C.E. was minimal. The Committee further concluded that the kind, level and pattern of whole person imputation in Census 2000 did not call the A.C.E. results into question.  Next Steps While the ESCAP has recommended against use of the adjusted data, the A.C.E.'s original objective of addressing the differential undercount must still be pursued. The totality of the evidence considered by the Committee leads it to believe that while Census 2000 successfully lowered the historical pattern of the differential undercount, it did not eliminate it. The net undercount remains disproportionately distributed among renters and minority populations. With further research, it is reasonable to expect that new information can be used to produce revised A.C.E. estimates. The evaluation results, including the new measurement tool of name matching, will be extremely valuable for evaluating the accuracy of Census 2000, planning for the 2010 census, and potentially for improving the post-censal estimates. Both census taking and coverage measurement are processes that evolve and improve with each census. The Census 2000 experience will help refine both census and coverage measurement processes for future censuses. v   Table of Contents Executive Summary .................................................... i Areas of Research .................................................... . i Evaluation Results .................................................... iii Next Steps .............................................................v ...................................................... vi .......................................................1  Table of Contents ESCAP II Report Introduction  ...............................................................1 Background ..............................................................1 ESCAP II Proceedings ....................................................1 Non-redistricting uses of the data ..........................................2 .......................................................4 Demographic Analysis ....................................................4 International Migration ................................................... 4 Measurement of Vital Events ..............................................5 Results of Revised DA ....................................................6 Research to Evaluate the A.C.E. and Census 2000 ..........................8 Matching Error Study ...... ..............................................9 Evaluation Followup .....................................................9 Person Duplication Studies ................................................9 Measurement of Erroneous Enumerations, Including Duplicates ............10 Measurement of Census Omissions ....................................... 11 Correlation Bias .........................................................12 A.C.E.

This recommendation was in accord with the recommendation of the Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP). The ESCAP1 was unable to conclude, based on information available at the time, that adjusted Census 2000 data were more accurate for redistricting. The ESCAP I Report is available on the Census Bureau's website, along with a voluminous Administrative Record supporting this recommendation. The primary issue that precluded ESCAP I from recommending use of the adjusted data was the unexplained difference between the A.C.E. and Demographic Analysis estimates of the population. Demographic analysis (DA) initially estimated the national total population to be below the census count, while the A.C.E. estimated the population to be above the census count. This discrepancy raised the significant possibility of an undetected problem with the A.C.E. or the census. ESCAP I also identified concerns with balancing and synthetic estimation error as potential problems in the adjusted data. The Committee directed the preparation of an extensive evaluation program to inform its deliberations relating to the proposed use of adjusted data for nonredistricting purposes.  ESCAP II Proceedings In the months since the ESCAP I Report, the Committee has embarked on a second round of deliberations to address the concerns identified in the report and to enable the Census Bureau to recommend whether the adjusted Census 2000 data should be used for nonredistricting purposes. These evaluations, the ESCAP II report series, set forth the underlying data that support the Committee's findings. The future uses in consideration include post-censal population estimates, demographic survey controls, and the census long form data products. Some of the required evaluations involved additional research, including additional field work and matching work. ESCAP II considered a wide variety of research and analyses, and heard presentations of the reports on the attached list (Attachment 1). Some of these presentations provided background information to help the Committee interpret the results of other studies, while others bore directly on the adjustment recommendation. While the Committee considered and deliberated on all of the listed reports, this discussion will focus on those most directly relevant to the  For clarity, the Committee that produced the March 1, 2001, ESCAP Report is sometimes referred to herein as ""ESCAP I"" and the March 1 report as the ""ESCAP I Report."" The Committee that has been meeting since March 1, 2001, is referred to as ""ESCAP II."" Page 1 of 18  1   comparative accuracy of the adjusted and unadjusted data. This research was conducted over many months and represents diligent and thorough statistical and demographic analysis.2 The Associate Director for Decennial Census originally chartered the ESCAP on November 26, 1999, and charged the Committee to ""advise the Director in determining policy for the A.C.E. and the integration of the A.C.E. results into the census for all purposes except Congressional reapportionment."" Although there was a change in the Associate Director for the Decennial Census position in June 2001, ESCAP II continued to be chaired by John Thompson to maintain continuity. The ESCAP resumed meeting on March 7, 2001, and met a total of 32 times, sometimes with more than one meeting per day. The ESCAP represents a body of senior career Census Bureau professionals, with advanced degrees in relevant technical fields and/or decades of experience in the federal statistical system. All are highly competent to evaluate the relative merits of the A.C.E. data versus the census data and are recognized for their extensive contributions to the professional community. As in the ESCAP I process, the early sessions were primarily educational, designed to inform Committee members of the research operations and to present general information about nonredistricting uses of the data. The second phase involved presentation by knowledgeable employees of the new data and analyses as they became available. The Committee reviewed the data and analyses, sometimes asking staff to provide additional and new information. The third phase was deliberation, where the Committee members met privately. The final and briefest stage was review, where Committee members commented on the draft report. Again, as in the ESCAP I process, minutes were prepared for all sessions, except for the final ones, which were private deliberations. During the education and evidence presentation phases, the Chair generally arranged presentations on major issues, issues that he identified on his own initiative or on the suggestion of Committee members. During the evidence presentation stage, authors of the analysis reports presented their data and conclusions to the Committee. The deliberation and review phases were less structured with various members raising topics for discussion and asking for evidence. No formal vote was held; this Report reflects a consensus of the ESCAP.  Non-redistricting uses of the data The ESCAP's recommendation covers the three non-redistricting uses of census data: postcensal estimates, demographic survey controls, and Census 2000 long form products. Certain Census Bureau data products have already been issued using only the unadjusted data, including the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Summary File, Demographic Profiles, Congressional District Demographic Profiles, Summary File 1 Data, and reports in the Census 2000 Brief Series.3 The ESCAP II Report Series does not represent the entirety of the Census Bureau's evaluation of Census 2000. The Census Bureau's formal Census 2000 Evaluation Program provides a comprehensive evaluation of all Census operations and programs. The reports in the ESCAP II series are only those necessary to inform the ESCAP's recommendation. 3 2  These models can be found at http://factfinder.census.gov. Page 2 of 18   Post-censal estimates are made by updating the most recent census base with estimates of population change (births, deaths, and net migration). As directed by the Census Act, the Census Bureau prepares post-censal estimates at the national, state, and county level every year, and at the functioning governmental unit level every other year.4 These estimates have a variety of uses, most notably in funding allocations, as the basis for sample survey controls, and as denominators for many important statistics. The accuracy of the post-censal estimates for funding allocations is critical, as about $200 billion are allocated based on these data each year. Medicaid (Title XIX) is the largest program to distribute federal funding based on population estimates, distributing over $100 billion each year based on the post-censal estimates. Community Development Block Grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Title I Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants from the Department of Education are two additional federal programs that use postcensal estimates as factors in their funding formulas to distribute federal monies. The individual states also have within-state fund allocation programs, many of which use post-censal estimates to allocate funds to sub-state areas. Many federal agencies use post-censal estimates as denominators to produce per capita statistics. Examples are per capita income, crime statistics, incidence of certain health conditions, birth rates, and mortality rates. The numerators of these statistics can be obtained at various points in time throughout the decade. In the absence of updated information, calculating these kinds of statistics on a static 2000 denominator would be misleading; therefore, many federal agencies use post-censal estimates of population. Demographic survey controls are used by many national sample surveys to transform the data they collect into nationally representative estimates. The most notable is the Current Population Survey, or CPS, which is used to calculate the monthly unemployment rate. Sample surveys generally have poorer coverage than a census; therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of estimates from a sample survey, the survey estimates are controlled to independent measures of the number of people in certain age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin groups, such as the post-censal estimates. The ESCAP Committee also considered whether adjusted or unadjusted Census 2000 data should be used for the controls for estimates based on data from the Census 2000 long form. The long form collects more extensive characteristic data from a sample of about seventeen percent of the population. Long form data are used to provide local communities with data on education, employment, housing, and various other social and demographic characteristics essential to efficient planning. Additionally, the long form provides the detailed local demographic and social characteristics used in some federal formula allocation programs. In order to produce estimates for the country as a whole from this sample, Census 2000 data from the short form items are used as controls.  4  13 U.S.C.  181.

ESCAP II, therefore, directed the preparation of a number of evaluation studies, as described in detail in Attachment 2. Research centered around four areas, demographic analysis, the A.C.E., Census 2000, and synthetic error. The results of this research are set forth below.  Demographic Analysis ESCAP I's primary concern was that DA estimates were inconsistent with A.C.E. estimates. The Census Bureau expected, based on past experience, that demographic analysis would posit a higher estimate of the total population than the A.C.E. because of the presence of correlation bias, and that the two estimates would agree generally on the coverage of certain populations. Instead, the Base DA estimates were lower than both the Census 2000 population counts and the A.C.E. estimates. In response, the Census Bureau developed its Alternative DA estimates by doubling the unauthorized immigration assumed to have occurred during the 1990's. Doing so yielded a number of foreign born for 2000 that was roughly consistent with that reported by the March 2000 Current Population Survey.5 The Alternative DA estimates were, however, still significantly lower than the A.C.E. estimates. The Alternative DA indicated that Census 2000 undercounted the population by 0.32 percent, while the A.C.E. produced a net undercount estimate of 1.15 percent.6 ESCAP I concluded that the inconsistency in the estimates of the total national population must have derived from one or more of three possible explanations. The first explanation was that all available 1990 census data, including the census results, the 1990 coverage measurement survey, and the 1990 DA estimates, significantly understated the Nation's population, but that Census 2000 found this previously un-enumerated population. The second explanation was that DA underestimated population growth between 1990 and 2000. The third explanation was that the A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's population. ESCAP II directed that further research on demographic analysis be conducted. It focused on two main topics: international migration and measurement of vital events like births and deaths. International Migration Assumptions regarding international migration were the most uncertain component in the demographic analysis estimates completed by March 1, 2001. Although the research agenda for  The March Current Population Survey was reweighted using the Census 2000 counts by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin for this comparison. This figure differs from the 1.18 percent usually quoted for the A.C.E. because the A.C.E. and DA estimate different populations. DA estimates the total population, while the A.C.E. estimates the household population, which excludes group quarters. Page 4 of 18 6  5   the March through October period focused primarily on those components of international migration that are less well measured (e.g., emigration, temporary migration, and unauthorized migration), the work also included research into legal immigration and the demographic characteristics of migrants used in the March 2001 DA estimates. Part of the analysis involved discussions with independent experts on demographic analysis and international migration. The purpose of a March 20, 2001, was to explain how the DA estimates differed from the A.C.E. estimates, and to discuss how to prioritize short-term and long-term research activities. Attendees included experts from the statistical community, academia, state agencies, the Census Bureau's advisory committees, professional organizations, and international organizations. A nearly unanimous recommendation from these experts was to focus on assumptions and estimates of the components of international migration, as these numbers were subject to the most uncertainty. Because of scheduling conflicts, two smaller meetings with other migration experts were held at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America on March 29-30, 2001. Expert advice was sought again, on September 24, 2001, after completion of the original research activities (validation of the 1990 estimates and updated 2000 estimates) that produced the revised DA estimates. Although these experts generally agreed with the methodology used to calculate components of international migration, they had concerns about the assumptions regarding the undercount of international migrants. Specifically, they believed the undercount assumption of 15 percent for unauthorized migrants, which was incorporated in the Revised DA, was probably too high, especially given the A.C.E. undercounts for other hard-to-enumerate groups. In addition, they urged renaming the residual migrant category as the residual foreignborn, or separating the residual foreign born into known components (""quasi-legal"" migrants) and the implied unauthorized migrant population. Both of these suggestions were incorporated into a subsequent sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis of assumptions about coverage of various components of the foreignborn population showed that the total number of foreign born did not vary enough to have much effect on the DA estimate of the total population. For example, the lower bound assumption of 3.3 percent net undercount of the foreign-born equated to a population of 281.3 million, or more than 3 million people lower than the A.C.E. total population. The upper bound assumption of 6.7 percent was consistent with a population of 282.5 million -- still more than 2 million lower than the A.C.E. total population. These results led the Census Bureau to conclude that the Revised DA was an appropriate benchmark for assessing Census 2000 and the A.C.E. estimates. Measurement of Vital Events Other research examined the remaining assumptions underlying the DA components of change, including the birth, death, and Medicare components. Although estimates of deaths and the size of the elderly population did not change much, the estimates of historical births changed because of this research. The principal outcome was a revision in the assumptions about registration completeness of births since 1968. The previous DA estimates assumed that all births in years since 1968 (the last year of testing birth registration completeness) were registered at the same percent (99.2 percent). For the Revised DA estimates, registration completeness gradually reached 100 percent by 1985 (the first year natality statistics were Page 5 of 18   reported electronically from all the States), and remained at 100 percent through 2000. This revision lowered the estimated number of births for 1968-2000 by 715,000 (which lowered the Revised DA estimate of the total population in 2000 by the same amount).7 Results of Revised DA The research undertaken between March and October allayed two fundamental concerns: first, the possibility that the Alternative DA did not capture the full growth of the population between 1990 and 2000, and second, the possibility that the 1990 DA was lower than the true population. In fact, the cumulative effect of the research on immigration, births, and deaths led to Revised DA estimates that were only slightly different from the Alternative DA. In other words, the inconsistency between the Alternative DA and the A.C.E. estimates was not the result of unexplained problems in DA. These results, in combination with other evidence, led the ESCAP to conclude that the A.C.E. overestimated the Nation's total population. More specifically, the Revised DA lowered the net undercount rates from 1.85 to 1.65 percent in 1990, and from 0.32 to 0.12 percent in 2000, but did not alter the DA finding that the net undercount rate in 2000 was substantially lower than in 1990.8 The Revised DA continued to measure a lower net undercount than the A.C.E., and in fact was very close to the Alternative DA estimate used by ESCAP I in March. The Revised DA estimated a net undercount of 0.3 million, or 0.12 percent, compared with the A.C.E. estimate of a net undercount of 3.3 million, or 1.15 percent. Population totals from the Base DA, Alternative DA, and Revised DA, along with the Census 2000 counts and the A.C.E. estimates, are shown in Table A. The corresponding numerical and percentage undercounts are shown in Figure 1.

Under the revised DA, the net undercount rate was reduced by 1.53 percentage points, from 1.65 percent in 1990 to 0.12 percent in 2000. In contrast, the A.C.E. estimate of 1.15 percent net undercount in 2000 was 0.43 percentage points lower than the 1.58 percent in 1990. Additionally, both DA and the A.C.E. measured a reduction in the net undercount rates of Black and nonBlack children compared with 1990. Both methods also measured a reduction in the net undercount rates of adult Black men and women. The revised DA and A.C.E. estimates continued to disagree in that DA found a reduction in the net undercount rates of nonBlack men and women in Census 2000 compared with the rates of previous censuses. The A.C.E. indicated no change or a slight increase in undercount rates for nonBlack adults as a group. Demographic analysis also provided evidence that correlation bias was not reduced between 1990 and 2000. Comparisons of the DA and A.C.E. sex ratios (men per 100 women) showed that correlation bias in the survey estimates was not reduced for Black men between 1990 and 2000. The A.C.E. sex ratios for Black adults were much lower than the expected sex ratios based on DA, implying that the A.C.E. did not capture the high undercount rate of Black men relative to Black women. The size of this bias was about the same as in the 1990 coverage measurement survey.

Research to Evaluate the A.C.E. and Census 2000 A number of the studies described more fully in Attachment 2 evaluate the accuracy of the A.C.E. and Census 2000. The A.C.E. is composed of two samples, the E-sample, which measures erroneous enumerations, and the P-sample, which measures census omissions. The E-sample is also used to estimate the number of census persons who do not have sufficient information to be used in A.C.E. matching and followup operations. The Dual System Estimates (DSEs) are computed by combining E-sample estimates of erroneous enumerations and insufficient information with P-sample estimates of omission. Therefore it is critical that the E-sample correctly account for erroneous enumerations and that the P-Sample correctly account for omissions. The evaluations were designed to measure the accuracy of both the P- and E-Samples. Three studies in particular produced substantial new information for ESCAP II: the Matching Error Study, the Evaluation Followup (EFU), and the Person Duplication Studies. Page 8 of 18   Matching Error Study  9  The Matching Error Study provided the P-sample matching error rate and the E-sample processing error rate. Expert matchers clerically rematched all of the people in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. clusters to determine the best match code. This information was compared to match codes assigned in production of the actual A.C.E. estimates. Evaluation Followup10 The EFU consisted of a reinterview of households in the same one-fifth subsample of A.C.E. clusters used in the Matching Error Study, with additional subsampling. EFU results helped determine the accuracy of the production data processed and collected in the P- and E-Samples. The EFU interview results were used to measure the accuracy of the classification of correct and erroneous census enumerations as determined by the E-Sample. The results were also used to measure the accuracy of the P-Sample data regarding mover status and Census Day residence. Person Duplication Studies 11  The Person Duplication Studies took advantage of the fact that Census 2000 was the first census to record name information in the data capture system in a way that permits computer matching. This new methodology permitted the Census Bureau to direct a nationwide computer matching operation to measure the level of duplication in the census. These studies also examined how well the A.C.E. accounted for these duplicates. While the A.C.E. matched respondents in the same block and surrounding blocks, this new tool permitted the Census Bureau to search for duplicates throughout the country. The Person Duplication Studies involved only computer matching, as the Census Bureau lacked the resources and time to match to the entire country using both computer and clerical matching. The computer matching thus understated the actual level of duplication. These studies also compared the results of the EFU with the Person Duplication Studies to determine whether the EFU correctly measured these duplications. Some of the error components produced in these studies suggest that the A.C.E. overestimated the net undercount while others suggest the net undercount was underestimated. 9  ESCAP II Report No. 7, ""Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Matching Error.""

Page 9 of 18 11  10   The results of these studies are discussed below, and are the basis for the recommendation that the adjusted data not be used due to a significant problem in the measurement of erroneous enumerations resulting in an overstatement of the net undercount by at least 3 million people.  Measurement of Erroneous Enumerations, Including Duplicates The evaluations of the accuracy of the A.C.E. indicated that the A.C.E. did not measure a significant portion of the Census 2000 erroneous enumerations. The measurement of erroneous enumerations is critical to both the national net undercount and to sub-national estimates. The effect of this error resulted in the A.C.E. significantly overstating the net Census 2000 undercount by at least 3 million people, with an approximate range of 3 to 4 million. The significance of this error was such that the ESCAP recommended that the unadjusted data be used for Census 2000 non-redistricting purposes. The EFU and the Person Duplication Studies described above provided the most significant information regarding the measurement of erroneous enumerations. The initial EFU results gave evidence of a significant understatement in the A.C.E. measurement of erroneous enumerations. Because of the significance of the understatement, the EFU was extensively reviewed. The revised EFU again also indicated a significant problem with understating the level of erroneous enumerations, and resulted in a high level of cases left unresolved or conflicting. The Person Duplication Studies found that a significant number of duplicate enumerations were not measured by the A.C.E., and that the EFU did not pick up significant portions of this error. The Person Duplication Studies also resolved a portion of the cases left unresolved or conflicting by the EFU Review. The EFU initially found a 3.5 percent change in enumeration status from that measured by A.C.E. production. A total of about 2,800,000 production ""correct enumerations"" (SE 223,000) were re-coded as ""erroneous enumerations,"" while about 900,000 production ""erroneous enumerations,"" (SE 99,000) were re-coded as ""correct enumerations.""12 The net difference found by the EFU was 1,900,000. The EFU also included about 4,500,000 cases (SE 353,000) that could not be resolved. This study indicted that, at a minimum, the A.C.E. overstated the level of net undercount by about 2 million people. Because of the EFU's potentially significant implications for the A.C.E. estimates, ESCAP decided that further EFU analysis was needed. Accordingly, more highly trained matching analysts from the National Processing Center (NPC) directly reviewed a subsample of the EFU and production cases. Matching analysts are employees at NPC with many years of training in matching, some with over 20 years of experience, who supervise and perform quality assurance for all the A.C.E. matching operations. This additional review confirmed that there were errors in the A.C.E.'s identification of erroneous enumerations. A total of about 1,800,000 enumerations (SE 189,000) that were coded as correct in production were subsequently coded erroneous in the evaluation, while the number 12  ESCAP II Report No. 3, ""Evaluation Results for Changes in A.C.E. Enumeration Page 10 of 18  Status.""   of enumerations coded as erroneous in production that were then coded as correct in the review was about 361,000 (SE 46,000).13 Consequently, the net difference in the ""correct enumeration"" to ""erroneous enumeration"" and ""erroneous enumeration"" to ""correct enumeration"" cells was estimated at 1,450,000, rather than the initial level of 1,900,000. However, the review identified over 15 million cases which could not be resolved or for which conflicting results were observed. Depending on assumptions that could be made regarding the enumeration status of these cases, the overstatement of the net undercount could range from about 1.45 million to up to 5.9 million people.14 The Person Duplication Studies found that a significant number of duplicate enumerations were not correctly measured by the A.C.E. or by the EFU. Furthermore, when the Person Duplication Studies results are combined with the EFU results, some of the unresolved and conflicting cases can be explained. Based on this work, more refined ranges for the level of the A.C.E. overstatement were developed. Direct estimates were produced from the Person Duplication Studies that indicated that the level of A.C.E. error not measured was about 3 million persons. In addition, it is also expected that further refinements to the treatment of the unresolved and conflicting cases would lead to about an additional 800,000 errors. Thus, the approximate range of the potential overstatement of the net undercount was reduced to between 3 and 4 million persons. Finally, the EFU provided information regarding whether the A.C.E. accurately measured Census 2000 discrepant enumerations.15 This study showed that the net effect of erroneously identifying discrepant persons as correct enumerations in production and vice versa is an overstatement of about 6,000 correct enumerations in production, with a standard error of about 30,000.16 This difference is statistically insignificant.  Measurement of Census Omissions Measurement of census omissions is based on the P-Sample. Therefore, accurate matching of the P-sample to the census, and the correct classification of mover status and Census Day residence, are important components of the P-Sample. Information about the accuracy of the  ESCAP II Report No. 24, ""Results of the Person Followup and Evaluation Followup Forms Review."" ESCAP II Report No. 24, ""Results of the Person Followup and Evaluation Followup Forms Review."" Discrepant results include falsification (the amount is uncertain), but do not include honest mistakes made by the interviewers or respondents. A person is classified as discrepant during the matching operation if three knowledgeable respondents indicate not knowing him or her in either the EFU or production interview. ESCAP II Report No. 4, ""A.C.E. Erroneous Enumerations Errors: Analysis of Census Discrepant Persons."" Page 11 of 18 16 15 14  13   matching was produced by the Matching Error Study. Information about the accuracy of the classification of movers and Census Day residence was derived from the EFU. The Matching Error Study indicated that the level of matching error from the P-Sample would result in about a 385,000 overstatement of the net undercount.17 The EFU demonstrated that misclassification of movers in the A.C.E. may have resulted in an understatement of about 450,000 in the net undercount.18 It should be noted that this final effect was the result of significant changes in mover status. These changes involved a large number of movers becoming nonmovers and vice versa. The EFU indicated that about 4.5 million people classified as ""movers"" in production became ""nonmovers,"" and that about 2.4 million people classified as ""nonmovers"" in production became ""movers."" At the national level there is therefore a small net effect of about 65,000 on the accuracy of the measurement of census omissions. However, more research must be conducted to further study these effects. The ESCAP was concerned about the EFU measurement of movers who became nonmovers, specifically about whether the EFU measured too few movers, due to its questionnaire design. To be classified a nonmover, the EFU required less detailed information than needed to be classified a mover. An examination of the bias caused by mover status changes indicates that the effect of mover-to-nonmover changes was greater in absolute value then the effect of nonmoverto-mover changes. Therefore, if there was an over reporting of nonmovers in the EFU, the effect would be to lower the measured net bias described above. Additional work must clearly be conducted to clarify this information. Furthermore, even though the net effects of these errors cancel at the national level, assessment of the subnational effects also requires further research.  Correlation Bias Correlation bias refers to the tendency for people enumerated in the census to be more likely to be included in the A.C.E. than those missed in the census. Correlation bias usually results in a downward bias in the DSE. This type of bias can result from causal dependence, that is, the tendency of some people to be more likely to be included in the A.C.E. because they had been included in the census, or vice versa, or from heterogeneity. Heterogeneity bias can arise because different people within poststrata both have different chances of being counted in the census and different chances of being included in the A.C.E. To cause a bias, these chances must be correlated, for example, those likely to be missed by the census are also most likely to be missed by the A.C.E. ESCAP I assessed possible correlation bias in the A.C.E. estimates by comparing the A.C.E. and DA results. Correlation bias estimates available for the March ESCAP recommendation used DA estimates as of February 26, 2001. ESCAP II directed that the correlation bias estimates be recomputed to use the Revised DA estimates and other newly available data. Revised correlation bias estimates were computed and discussed by the Committee. 17  ESCAP II Report No. 7, ""Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Matching Error.""  ESCAP II Report No. 16, ""Evaluation Results for changes in Mover and Residence Status in the A.C.E."" Page 12 of 18  18   Like ESCAP I, ESCAP II was faced with the fact that while correlation bias exists, it is difficult to quantify. Correlation bias is an important component of assessing the A.C.E.'s accuracy because assumptions regarding correlation bias have a large effect. ESCAP II considered several models of correlation bias, including whether correlation bias should be assumed only for the Black population, whether the Hispanic population should be assumed to have the same degree of correlation bias as the Black population, and whether correlation bias should be assumed to be the same for owners and renters. Correlation bias would mean that the A.C.E. estimates of total population were too low by about 750,000 to 1.3 million, depending on which model for correlation bias is assumed.19 Currently the Census Bureau has no means of incorporating these net biases in the production DSEs.  A.C.E. Missing Data Missing data occurs in the A.C.E. if, after all followup attempts, there remain households that were not interviewed, or households with some portions of the person data missing, such as age or race. Sometimes the missing item involves the status of whether a person matched, was a resident on Census Day, or was correctly enumerated. Statistical models are used to account for missing data. ESCAP I viewed the rates of occurrence of unresolved A.C.E. cases for match status, correct enumeration status, and mover status as low enough to preclude serious biases in the A.C.E. results. ESCAP II directed development of additional missing data models to assess the effect on the estimates of using alternative models. The treatment of missing data can have a large effect on the A.C.E. estimates under certain assumptions. ESCAP II examined a variety of models to predict the effects of missing data. Seven basic methods for addressing the components of missing data in the A.C.E. estimates were considered in various combinations. Each resulting alternative model was used to compute new DSE. The alternatives considered indicated that the choice of missing data model can have a significant effect on the resulting estimates of coverage error, causing the DSEs to be over- or under-stated. The Census Bureau chose to represent the effects of these alternative models in the form of increased uncertainty in the A.C.E. estimates. The DSEs that resulted from the alternative models were used to calculate a measure of variation similar to a sampling error. This research found that non-sampling variability from the use of alternative missing data models was considerable. At the national level, the overall magnitude of the variation resulting from all combinations of the alternative missing data models (about 530,000) was higher than the DSE sampling error (about 380,000).20 When some alternative models were excluded, the standard deviation was of approximately the same magnitude as the DSE sampling error, but there is no evidence to suggest that the measure of variation based on all methods is unreasonable. In fact, arguments could be made that this measure understates the actual levels of variation due to missing data because it assumes that the  ESCAP II Report No. 10, ""Estimation of Correlation Bias in 2000 A.C.E. Estimates Using Revised Demographic Analysis Results."" 20  19  ESCAP II Report No. 12, ""Analysis of Missing Data Alternatives."" Page 13 of 18   alternatives considered were randomly distributed around an average, that is, each alternative was equally likely. ESCAP II also examined information describing the level and distribution of A.C.E. missing data compared to the 1990 coverage measurement survey. The purpose of this review was to put the levels of missing data in context with 1990, and to add to the understanding of the alternative missing data model analysis previously described. The 2000 unresolved rates were slightly higher than those in 1990, but were not initially viewed as high enough to cause major concern. The alternative model analysis indicated that missing data had a more significant effect than anticipated, possibly due to changes in the methods for incorporating movers into the DSE, or to a more diverse set of alternative models.  Balancing Error The ESCAP I Report had identified balancing error as a potential problem, noting that the A.C.E. found 3 million more matches in surrounding blocks than correct enumerations, a result which could have affected the accuracy of the estimates. The A.C.E. matching is carried out in a defined search area consisting of the A.C.E. sample blocks (clusters) and a targeted area of blocks surrounding or bordering the A.C.E blocks. Significant differences were discovered between the number of matches and correct enumerations found in the surrounding blocks. Various scenarios were identified that could explain the difference, and ESCAP II directed that evaluations be conducted to investigate the source of this difference, identify the scale of any error, and assess whether its magnitude could significantly affect the accuracy of the adjusted data. This analysis necessitated additional field work. The evaluations indicated that the causes of the discrepancies were for the most part related to a scenario that does not significantly affect the resulting DSEs. That is, most of the 3 million difference was attributable to the A.C.E. listing housing units in the blocks surrounding the sample blocks, which had little, if any, effect on the DSE. The evaluations did, however, detect about 246,000 A.C.E people (SE 82,000) located out of the surrounding blocks.21 The evaluations also estimated that an additional 195,000 people (SE 56,000) were incorrectly identified as having been correctly enumerated, but although they were found to have been out of the search area. The effect of these errors is an approximate overstatement of the net undercount by about 450,000 persons. It appeared that a portion of these errors were also included in the results of the EFU and Matching Error Study. While some additional work is required to completely resolve the potential effects of balancing error, the ESCAP believes that most of the previous concerns regarding balancing error have been addressed.  Conditioning Conditioning, or contamination bias, refers to the situation where the A.C.E. influenced the census. ESCAP I assumed in its deliberations that any effects of conditioning or contamination bias were minimal, and could be ignored. This assumption was based on previous experiences in ESCAP II Report No. 2, ""Evaluation of Lack of Balance and Geographic Errors Affecting Person Estimates."" Page 14 of 18 21   the 1990 census. Evidence presented to ESCAP II confirmed that contamination bias was not a problem in Census 2000, as research did not identify any evidence of its presence.22  Reinstated Late Additions While ESCAP I did not identify Census 2000 late additions as a source of error, levels of these additions were significantly higher than in the 1990 census. Late additions refers to persons included in the final census count who were excluded from A.C.E. matching and dual system estimation because of their late inclusion. For Census 2000, the late additions consisted exclusively of housing units that were temporarily removed from the census because they were suspected to duplicate other housing units, but which were later (after the A.C.E. matching process started) reinstated into the final census after further research. ESCAP I determined that if the reinstated people were a small percentage of the correct enumerations in the census, or if their A.C.E. coverage rate was similar to the A.C.E. coverage rate for census people included in A.C.E., then there would be a minimal effect on the DSEs.23 To validate this assumption, additional research was conducted. Based on this additional work, ESCAP II concluded that the effect of excluding reinstated census people from the A.C.E. was minimal. The A.C.E. coverage rate may have been overestimated by 0.034 to 0.082 percentage points.24 This result confirmed the assumption, previously made in the ESCAP I Report, that the effect of the reinstated people on the DSEs would be small.  Census 2000 Imputations Census 2000 experienced a higher rate of whole person imputations than in the 1990 census. Whole person imputations were excluded from A.C.E. matching activities, but reflected in the census coverage error as measured by the A.C.E. ESCAP I was concerned that information was not available at the time to validate that the whole person imputations were explainable by Census 2000 design features (and thus should have no discernible impact on the A.C.E.). ESCAP II concluded that the kind, level, and pattern of whole person imputations in Census 2000 raised no additional issues relative to the accuracy of the A.C.E. adjustment. Approximately 5.77 million persons had all their characteristics (short form data items) imputed in Census 2000, compared to 1.97 million persons in the 1990 census. Approximately 1.2 million of these persons were added to the census count through a count imputation process. The remaining 4.6 million persons were counted directly through the census enumeration ESCAP II Report No. 14, ""Conditioning of Census 2000 Data Collected in Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Block Clusters.""

Page 15 of 18   process, but had all their person characteristics imputed because information about them was substantially missing from the census records.25 Research into the sources of the whole person imputations identified that changes in the census design contributed to the level of housing units requiring imputation. Furthermore, the count imputation rate was comparable to the rate experienced in the 1970 and 1980 censuses. Characteristics of the imputed persons were also examined. The age, race and sex characteristics of the population requiring some form of imputation was similar to the datadefined population with the exception of the age category under 18. The relatively higher percent of the population under age 18 in the imputed population was due to the high proportion of younger people in the ""within household"" category and reflected the fact that large households (greater than 6) were likely to have children not able to be accommodated by the 6-person mailreturn form, and thus require imputation.26  Total Error Model and Loss Function Analysis The total error model is designed to incorporate the results of the evaluations to produce a composite estimate of the bias and variability (both sampling and non-sampling) in the A.C.E. These measures are used to correct the A.C.E., thus producing measures of the ""true"" population that can be used to assess the accuracy of the adjusted and unadjusted census data. The total error model produces measures of this ""true"" population in the form of target populations which are based on various assumptions because the truth is not known.27 The total error model used by ESCAP I relied in part on 1990 data, as complete Census 2000 evaluations of the A.C.E were not then available. This preliminary model adapted the 1990 total error model to the Census 2000 environment. For the current deliberations, the ESCAP II wanted to base recommendations on current data. Therefore, development of a new total error model was undertaken to incorporate the results of the Census 2000 evaluations. The complexities of the revised EFU study and the A.C.E. design did not allow for the development and validation of a new total error model. Therefore, the ESCAP has had to rely on the individual evaluations described above. It is also apparent that a significant amount of additional research and development will be necessary before a complete total error model is available. ESCAP II believes that the information currently available is strong enough to preclude the use of adjusted data for any further Census 2000 purposes, but that future research may lead to improved A.C.E. estimates, that could, in turn, be used to improve the post-censal estimates.  25  ESCAP II Report No. 21, ""Analysis of Census Imputations.""

Page 16 of 18  27   Synthetic Estimation The A.C.E. estimation methodology produces estimated coverage correction factors for each post-stratum. These factors were carried down within the post-strata in a process referred to as synthetic estimation. The key assumption underlying synthetic estimation is that net census coverage is relatively uniform within the post-strata. Failure of this assumption leads to synthetic error. Synthetic error affects both the adjusted and unadjusted census results. ESCAP I analyzed the effects of synthetic error by using artificial populations, which are populations created with surrogate variables to reflect the distribution of net coverage error. Additional synthetic estimation analysis for ESCAP II focused on expanding the scope of the earlier artificial population work. ESCAP II continues to be concerned with synthetic error because it is not included directly in the total error model. However, as the synthetic error analysis must be considered in conjunction with loss function analysis based on the total error model, there is no need to consider the effects of synthetic error at this point.  Conclusion ESCAP II recommends that unadjusted Census 2000 data be used for non-redistricting purposes. The Committee was persuaded by new evidence indicating that the A.C.E. overstated the net undercount by at least 3 million individuals as a result of the survey's failure to measure a significant number of census erroneous enumerations. However, the Committee believes that, while Census 2000 successfully lowered the differential undercount, it did not eliminate it. Therefore, the Census Bureau will conduct further research and analyses to attempt to produce revised A.C.E. estimates that can be used to improve future post-censal estimates. The ESCAP II recommendation, if accepted, means that Census 2000 long form results will be weighted with unadjusted population counts, and that post-censal population estimates and survey controls will also rely on unadjusted data. The Census Bureau will continue research on the issues discovered with the A.C.E., particularly the issue of census duplicates and their estimation or detection. It is quite possible that this research will develop methods to improve future population estimates by combining information from the census, A.C.E., and the A.C.E. evaluations, including the Person Duplication Studies. Post-censal estimates and survey controls are updated annually, offering the opportunity to incorporate improvements. Even if the research does not lead to improved post-censal estimates, it will still further our understanding of the nature of census duplications and other erroneous enumerations, and the problems with their estimation by the A.C.E. This knowledge will be vitally important to the planning of the 2010 census and to the improvement of future coverage surveys. Both census taking and coverage measurement are processes that evolve and improve with each census. The Census 2000 experience will help refine both census and coverage measurement processes for future censuses.  Page 17 of 18   Attachments 1. List of ESCAP II Reports 2.

Policy (ESCAP) recommendation that the Census 2000 Redistricting Data not be adjusted based on the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) program data. The ESCAP was unable to conclude, based on information available at the time, that the adjusted Census 2000 data were more accurate for redistricting. By mid-October, the Census Bureau will recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for future uses, such as the census long form data products, post-censal population estimates and Census Bureau demographic survey controls. In order to inform this decision, further research will be conducted generating data for ESCAP's review. The analyses will focus on resolving the concerns that ESCAP identified during its deliberations for the redistricting adjustment decision. This document describes the research agenda and is organized by the topic areas of concern. The broad, overarching concern was that the Demographic Analysis and the A.C.E. estimates of the population were inconsistent. Even though alternative demographic estimates were produced by varying the assumptions underlying the Demographic Analysis, the highest reasonable estimate indicated that Census 2000 undercounted the population by 0.32 percent, while the A.C.E. produced a net undercount estimate of 1.15 percent1. In previous censuses since 1960, the Demographic Analysis estimates were used to evaluate decennial census coverage. The estimate derived through the 1990 coverage measurement survey was reasonably consistent with the 1990 Demographic Analysis estimate of the total population. When the corresponding estimates for Census 2000 were found to reflect substantial differences in the population estimates, this concerned the ESCAP. Four scenarios were identified that could explain this result:  The 1990 census coverage measurement survey (Post Enumeration Survey), 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates, and the 1990 census may have understated the Nation's population, while Census 2000 included portions of this previously unidentified population. Demographic Analysis estimates might not have captured the full growth between 1990 and 2000, specifically due to static assumptions about critical components of international migration such as unauthorized migration, temporary migration, and emigration.    The 1.15 percent and 0.32 percent of the undercount rates are based on census counts that include both the housing unit and group quarters populations. 1  1     Census 2000, as adjusted by the A.C.E., might overestimate the Nation's population. This situation raises the possibility of an undiscovered problem with the A.C.E. or Census 2000 methodology. A combination of these explanations.    To address these possibilities, further research is required into the quality of the three independent measures of the population - the Demographic Analysis estimate, the A.C.E. estimate and the census count itself. Specifically, research will address whether the Demographic Analysis estimate was too low and/or whether the adjusted estimate was too high. The latter situation could have occurred if either the A.C.E. did not measure the coverage error accurately or the census count had coverage error reflected by components not measured by the A.C.E. In addition, the ESCAP was concerned about two other issues related to the A.C.E. estimates balancing error and synthetic error. Balancing error occurs in the A.C.E. when cases are handled differently in the two independent samples (the P- and E- samples) when identifying gross omissions and erroneous enumerations. This is explained more fully under section B.1.a below. Synthetic error reflects the extent that net census coverage within a post-stratum is not relatively uniform. Uniformity of coverage is the underlying assumption of the synthetic estimation process of carrying coverage correction factors down to the block level. The concerns regarding synthetic error are described more fully in section D below. The analysis agenda is organized around four basic areas of research: 1) recalculation of Demographic Analysis estimates using new migration assumptions as well as new birth and death data, 2) A.C.E. issues, including balancing error, 3) Census 2000 issues and 4) synthetic error. A. Demographic Analysis (DA) Research This area of research addresses the discrepancy of the demographic analysis data and the A.C.E. adjusted estimates of population. Specifically, this area of research will reexamine the historic levels of the components of population change to address the scenarios dealing with the possibility that the 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates understated the Nation's population and that demographic analysis did not capture the full growth between 1990 and 2000. Consultation with demographic experts inside and outside the Census Bureau has led to a research program consisting of a variety of research projects focused on the methodologies and underlying estimates of the components of population change. The research activities are concentrated in two areas: 1. International Migration Assumptions regarding international migration are the most uncertain component of the demographic analysis estimates. The international migration component represents a combination of several components. Some of these components, e.g. legal immigration, are measured through continuous administrative data. For other components, e.g. temporary migration, emigration, and unauthorized migration, we do not have administrative data to provide continuous and current measurements. In the past, we 2   have relied upon the most recent decennial data to develop a once a decade measure of these components. Thus, for the 1990 to 2000 decade, we would have relied upon the measurement from the 1990 census to develop an estimate for the 1990 to 2000 decade. This work will involve examining preliminary data from the Census 2000 long form and the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) to provide information to update the measurement of the international migration components. Although the research will focus primarily on those components less well measured, e.g. emigration, temporary migration, and unauthorized immigration, the work will also include research into all of the current assumptions relating to the components of international migration The first goal is to validate for the 1990 to 2000 period, the calculation of the components of international migration used in previous estimates. Then, using the preliminary data from the Census 2000 long form and possibly the C2SS, we will develop some updated measures of the components of international migration. The second goal is to assess if the documented calculation of the 1990 to 2000 migration components affect the DA estimate for 2000 and thus account for some of the discrepancy with the A.C.E. results. Research to be conducted includes the following:  We will examine the assumptions about international migration flows, specifically for unauthorized migration, legal immigration, emigration, temporary migration, and migration from Puerto Rico. Utilizing preliminary long form data from Census 2000 and other information sources (including C2SS), we can prepare the first set of documentation for our current international migration assumptions and we can assess the accuracy of assuming a continuation of the estimates developed from the 1990 Census data. Specifically, we will estimate migration using available long-form data on place of birth, citizenship, and year of entry and compare this estimate to the estimates previously used that were developed from the 1990 Census long form data. Thus we will evaluate differences in size and characteristics of previously implied flows based on current data sets. If appropriate, we will recalculate the demographic analysis estimates for 2000 employing any revised levels of international migration. We will assess the quality of the foreign-born and Hispanic population data (important because these data are major inputs to the setting of assumptions noted above). We will review edit and allocation procedures for foreign-born and Hispanic populations in the 1990 and 2000 censuses and attempt to quantify the effect (or at least address the direction of the effect) of any differences. We also will review the impact of any change in the edits and allocation procedures on the size and characteristics of these population groups.    2. Robustness of Demographic Analysis In addition to the research aimed at examining the components of international migration used in the demographic analysis estimates, we will examine the remaining assumptions underlying the Demographic Analysis components of change. These components include the birth, death, and Medicare components. This work will entail the following:  We will examine the consistency of the components by cohort and age/sex groups across time (1935 to 2000), including the historical international migration 3   components. We will construct DA undercount rates for the 1940 to 2000 decennial censuses and examine them for consistency. We will examine the consistency of sex ratios across cohorts and age/sex groups. Inconsistent or anomalous results will be noted, and possible reasons identified.  We will review the assumptions about the completeness of vital statistics registration. Specifically, we will review the historic levels of births and deaths used to develop existing DA estimates and the assumptions about the underregistration of births and registration of infant deaths. We will evaluate both the procedures for adjusting births for underregistration and the level of historical deaths (both total and by age). If appropriate, we will redevelop the historical annual levels of births and deaths to 1990 and 2000. We will examine the assumptions about the variation and coverage of Medicare data. This work will include documenting the differences in the sources of Medicare data used in the 1990 and 2000 DA estimates, evaluating the adjustment rates used for underenrollment in the 1990 and 2000 DA estimates, and reconciling the differences in the Medicare files for 1990 and 2000. If appropriate, we will recalculate the demographic analysis estimates for 1990, compare them to the original 1990 Demographic Analysis estimates, and assess their impact on the DA estimates for 2000. We will analyze the consistency of DA estimates of the population, by race, ethnicity, and nativity, with Census 2000 and A.C.E. This work will entail 1) developing DA benchmarks of the population, by selected race, ethnicity, and nativity groups, 2) obtaining census tabulations of the native and foreign-born populations from preliminary Census 2000 and the 1990 Census long forms, and 3) comparing to the DA benchmarks to derive coverage estimates by selected age, sex, and race groups.        B. A.C.E. Issues and Planned Research 1. Major Areas of Research a. Balancing Error The A.C.E. was conducted using a defined area of search, the sample blocks and surrounding blocks for clusters selected for targeted extended search. There were concerns, since there was a change in the 1990 procedure of expanding the search area to surrounding blocks for all sample blocks. We found 3 million more matches in surrounding blocks than correct enumerations after expanding the search area. This difference must be explained in terms of its impact on subsequent estimates of total population. There are two scenarios: C The unit is located in the surrounding block with no effect on estimates of coverage, but would explain the three million difference.  4   C  The unit is outside the search area and the corresponding people should have been coded erroneous enumerations. This would result in an overestimate of the net undercount.  This may have been compounded by the targeting used in the A.C.E. to match in an area of search around the sample blocks, i.e., the search area. This targeting to make searching effective may have introduced limitations and/or biases into our measurement of coverage. There were three specific concerns in our review of the 2000 A.C.E. C There were a number of census people that might have been coded as correctly enumerated although the housing unit was not actually located in the sample block. If we didn't estimate the correct number of erroneously enumerated cases, the result would be an overestimate of the net undercount. The P-sample may have incorrectly included some housing units in a neighboring block, then in the extended search, the people would have been recorded as matching to the census in the surrounding blocks. Hence, these cases would appear to be balancing error when, in fact, the extended search was compensating for the original listing error. If the P sample had more geocoding error than expected, the Targeted Extended Search (TES) would have compensated for the error and the impact would be trivial and would have little or no impact on final coverage estimates. This would help explain some of the differences of the apparent lack of balance of 3 million.2 Problems in identifying census geocoding errors may have affected the sampling used to select people for extended search outside the sample blocks. That is, the TES sample could have excluded cases it should have included and thus, not matched or followed up on them correctly. The effect of their exclusion would be an overestimate of the net undercount.  C  C  It is likely that all of these errors occurred to some extent. What is not yet known is the scale of the error and whether the magnitude of the error was such as to significantly affect the relative accuracy of the A.C.E. adjusted numbers. The additional geographic field work is described in more detail in the attachment. b. Erroneous Enumerations Subsequent to the March 1st decision, a new area of concern was identified. In comparing the A.C.E. measures to the comparable measures from the 1990 Census, the Census 2000 erroneous enumerations were found to differ substantially from the 1990 measures. These differences indicate concerns that the level of erroneous  Assume 2.6 million of the P-sample are listed in the surrounding blocks. If 95% of them are in the search area (a plausible percentage), and if 90% match (about the overall match rate), then we have accounted for 2.2 million matches to the surrounding blocks. When we divide this 2.2 million by the P-sample coverage of 0.94, we have accounted for about 2.36 million of the 3 million lack of balance. 5  2   enumerations may be understated for Census 2000. Therefore, these differences must be explained because an understatement of erroneous enumerations results in an overstatement of net undercount. Research described below will quantify the accuracy of the A.C.E. measures of erroneous enumeration. C The Analysis of Measurement Error Study will determine how well the A.C.E. identified erroneous enumerations and correct enumerations. This study is based on a reinterview of a sample of E-sample records. This is described more fully in section B.1.c below. Another evaluation based on results from the `E-sample Erroneous Enumeration Study' will analyze the erroneous enumerations for various characteristics. This evaluation will compare the rates of the different types of erroneous enumerations for Census 2000 with corresponding 1990 rates. This evaluation will also recategorize people with unresolved status into the appropriate erroneous enumeration categories by using data from the followup forms. The goal of this work will identify explanations for differences between 1990 and 2000 coding of erroneous enumerations. The duplication study discussed in Section C1 will also provide information regarding the differences between 1990 and 2000. This study will validate whether the A.C.E. process is correctly coding census 2000 duplicate enumerations as erroneous.  C  C  c. Total Error Model and Loss Functions Loss function analyses, reviewed by the ESCAP during its deliberations on whether to adjust the census redistricting data, were based on a total error model that corrected the A.C.E. for biases, thus producing measures of the ""true"" population that could be used as standards for comparing the adjusted and unadjusted census results. The 1990 total error model was adapted to the extent possible to ""fit"" the 1990 coverage measurement survey error components into the 2000 survey design. This model was updated with available Census 2000 data, but retained several error component measures obtained from the 1990 coverage measurement survey and 1990 evaluations, because the 2000 A.C.E. evaluation data were not yet available. Thus, the error model assumed that the actual A.C.E. error rates for these components were similar to those reflected by the 1990 coverage measurement survey results. This was viewed as conservative because it was expected that the A.C.E. was of higher quality than the 1990 coverage measurement survey. Work is underway to validate that the assumption above is correct. We are conducting studies to revise the 1990 total error model to reflect actual A.C.E. error components, as measured by 2000 evaluations. Because of methodological changes between 1990 and 2000, there are issues that influence the comparability of this updated analysis to the March 2001 analysis. The analysis will include a discussion of the comparability.  6   The A.C.E. error components that were previously based on 1990 data will now be measured and input into the revised total error model are: P-sample P-sample P-sample E-sample matching error data collection error discrepancy error processing and data collection errors  Synthetic error is not included in the total error model -- this component of error is discussed later. A.C.E. error rates for these total error model components will be obtained from the following evaluation studies.  The Matching Error Study will provide the A.C.E. P-sample matching error rate and E-sample processing error rates. The methodology consists of the clerical rematching of all of the people in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. clusters by expert matchers to determine the best match code possible. We will compare that match and residence information to the production codes. The Analysis of Measurement Error Study uses the results of the Evaluation Followup Interview to provide the error components for E-sample and P-sample data collection error relating to person coverage, and P-sample discrepancy error. The methodology consists of revisiting some of the households in a one-fifth subsample of the A.C.E. clusters and using that information to rematch the Census and A.C.E. people in those households. The results of this study will determine the accuracy of the data going into the person matching process, such as the results from Census and A.C.E. questionnaires. This can involve reclassification of correct and erroneous enumerations. We will determine the accuracy of the residence status of A.C.E. people and how well the A.C.E. process identified Census erroneous enumerations (EEs) and correct enumerations (CEs).    Once the total error model is updated with current data, new loss function analyses will be conducted. The loss function analyses will be expanded to analyze the accuracy of governmental units, in addition to states and counties. No loss function analyses will be run for congressional districts. d. Correlation Bias Correlation bias in Dual System Estimates (DSEs) results from a failure of the general independence assumption underlying DSEs due either to causal dependence or heterogeneity. Causal dependence occurs when the act of being included in the census makes someone more likely or less likely to be included in the A.C.E. Heterogeneity occurs when the census and A.C.E. inclusion probabilities vary over persons within post-strata. When heterogeneity within post-strata exists it is generally suspected to be of the form where persons more likely to be missed in the Census are also more likely to be missed in the coverage survey (A.C.E.). This will lead to underestimation of true population by the DSEs. The direction of the effect of causal dependence, if it exists, is less certain. 7   Correlation bias in the A.C.E. estimates, whether due to heterogeneity or causal dependence, was assessed by comparing A.C.E. and DA results. Correlation bias estimates available for the March 1, 2001 ESCAP recommendation used DA estimates as of February 26, 2001. If further DA research results in revisions to the DA estimates, then the correlation bias estimates will be recomputed. The revised correlation bias estimates will then be used as inputs for revisions of the total error model and loss function analyses. 2. Auxiliary Areas of Research This section describes other areas that did not preclude ESCAP from recommending that Census 2000 data should be adjusted for redistricting purposes, but for which ESCAP would have preferred additional data. Further research in these areas will be conducted in order to confirm the ESCAP's conclusions. a. Missing Data Missing data occurs in the A.C.E. if after all followup attempts there remain households that were not interviewed or households with some portions of the person data missing such as age or race. Sometimes the missing item involves the status of whether a person matched, was a resident on Census day or was correctly enumerated. For a small number of people in the P-Sample, there was not enough information available to determine the match status (whether or not the person matched to someone in the census in the appropriate search area) or the resident status (whether or not the person was living in the block cluster on Census Day). Determining residence status was important for the P-Sample because Census Day residents of the block clusters in the sample were used to estimate the proportion of the population who were not counted in the census. Similarly, some people in the E-Sample lacked information to determine whether the person was correctly enumerated. Generally for cases with missing status a probability of resident, match, or correct enumeration was assigned based on information available about the specific case and about cases with similar characteristics. The rates of occurrence of unresolved A.C.E. cases for match status, correct enumeration status, and mover status were viewed as low enough to preclude serious biases in the A.C.E. results. We are now doing analysis of the missing data model to determine if the assumptions are correct. We will develop and apply alternative models for the treatment of missing data. These alternative models will be carried through A.C.E. estimation process so that the effect on DSEs can be assessed. b. Late Census 2000 Additions The levels of late Census 2000 additions were significantly higher than in the 1990 census. Late additions are those persons included in the final census counts, but which due to their late inclusion were excluded from in the A.C.E. matching and dual 8   system estimation processes. For Census 2000, the late additions consisted exclusively of housing units that were temporarily removed from the census because they were suspected to duplicate other housing units, but which were later (after the A.C.E. matching process started) reinstated into the final census after further research was conducted. This differs from the 1990 Census in which the late additions were persons who were enumerated too late in the census cycle to be included in the matching and dual system estimation processes and were not factored into the coverage ratios. The A.C.E. design treated the late census data appropriately in measuring the census undercount. Two areas of concern require further investigation -- whether calculating DSEs without these additions resulted in a bias in the estimates and whether these impacted the assumptions underlying the synthetic estimation model. There is no expectation of a bias in the dual system estimate caused by excluding late additions. The dual system estimate can be expressed as a product of the 1) number of A.C.E. people and 2) the ratio of census complete and correct enumerations to the number of people in both systems. Consequently, any effect must come from one of these two sources. Excluding the late additions does not impact the estimate of the number of A.C.E. people, which come solely from the A.C.E. enumerated sample. Excluding the late additions also will not affect the dual system estimate of the true population if the number of matches is reduced proportionately to the number of census correct enumerations. Given the traditional dual system independence assumption, one would expect this result. Consequently, there is no expectation of a bias in the dual system estimate caused by excluding late additions. Data were not available at the time to validate this assumption. We will now attempt to validate this assumption by performing a rematch of the Pand E-samples, with the late additions included in the E-sample, to attempt to measure the impact on the rates for correct enumerations and duplicates. This rematch will be conducted in a one-fifth subsample of A.C.E. clusters. This study has limitations because only computer and clerical matching can now be performed; that is, no field work will be conducted. Consequently, a high rate of unresolved cases is expected. The concerns regarding synthetic error are addressed in Section D. ""Synthetic Error"". c. Conditioning Conditioning error occurs under two scenarios: 1. Census data collection affects the A.C.E. This will be measured in the correlation bias. 2. A.C.E data collection affects the census. This will be examined in the evaluation described below.  9   The effect of potential conditioning of Census 2000 respondents by the A.C.E. operations was assumed to be minimal, similar to the 1990 findings. The research is necessary to confirm this assumption. An evaluation will examine whether census and A.C.E. operations were kept operationally independent. The analysis will be based on comparing Census 2000 results in A.C.E. and non-A.C.E. blocks.  Mover Status Analysis The match rate portion of the DSE formula (M/P) uses persons with all types of mover status (nonmovers, outmovers, and inmovers), differentiating between the different types of mover status. Therefore, misclassification of mover status could cause the DSEs to be overstated, understated, or both, depending on the post-strata. The Measurement Error Reinterview Analysis will measure the extent of mover misclassification by using the results from the Evaluation Followup Interview.  Housing Unit Coverage The coverage of housing units will be available in the late summer of 2001. These data will be examined in relation to person coverage estimates for 2000. These data from 2000 will be compared to the 1990 estimates of person and housing unit coverage. In addition, another study will assess the impact of housing unit coverage on person coverage. This study looks at the P-sample to analyze the effect of housing unit nonmatches on the person nonmatches. The E-sample is also examined to help understand the relationship of housing unit status to person status. The correctly enumerated people in erroneously enumerated housing units are of particular interest.  P-sample Nonmatch Analysis The P-sample nonmatches are examined for variables such as race domain and age/sex group to see if the nonmatches are different for various types of people. This aids in the understanding of the components of A.C.E. and also helps explain the differences between A.C.E. and DA. In addition, the nonmatches from 2000 are compared to the nonmatches from 1990. In conjunction with the analysis of the E-sample, it helps explain the differences between 1990 and 2000. C. Census 2000 Issues and Planned Research Research will be conducted into two components of the census - duplication issues and imputation of persons. A high level of duplication not measured by the A.C.E. design could cause the adjusted census estimate to be too high. The effect of imputed persons records are also not measured by the A.C.E. The number of person records that were imputed in Census 10   2000 was significantly higher than in the 1990 census. The assumption is that the imputed persons are no different than the persons included in the A.C.E. process and therefore match rates are not impacted. 1. Duplication Not Measured in A.C.E. The A.C.E. methodology by design did not measure duplication between components of the population living in group quarters and in housing units because group quarters were outside the A.C.E. universe. The A.C.E. also did not measure duplication within the group quarters population. Significant duplication of these types could explain some of the differences between demographic analysis and the adjusted Census 2000 data. The A.C.E. E-sample will be computer matched to the entire census to determine the extent of duplicate enumerations that were not in scope for the A.C.E. This analysis will potentially explain some of the differences between demographic analysis and the A.C.E. We also plan an extended computer search within the A.C.E. E-sample for duplicate census enumerations among housing units and also between housing units and group quarters persons (which were out-of-scope for A.C.E.) This will help to explain differences between the A.C.E. and the 1990 coverage measurement survey. 2. Census Person Imputations Census 2000 imputed a higher number of cases than in the 1990 census that came through the process with little or no information as to the occupancy status, or with an occupied status, but with no definitive population count. In addition, Census 2000 imputed more whole person records in cases with known household sizes, but with all the person data missing for some or all of the household members. Although the A.C.E. handled imputed persons appropriately in the estimation process, there was concern about not having information as to what census design processes contributed to the number of imputed persons when compared to the 1990 census. Given the potential impact that this level of imputations may have on Census 2000 data, it is essential to understand the demographic characteristics of the imputed people and how this may help explain the difference between the census and demographic analysis, as well as, how the imputations affect differences between the E-sample in 1990 and the E-sample in 2000. There were concerns expressed regarding the effect of whole household imputations on the heterogeneity assumption but these concerns are studied under the synthetic error analysis in Section D. D. Synthetic Error The synthetic assumption states that census net coverage does not vary within post-strata. For example, the synthetic assumption implies that census counts in Florida in a particular Hispanic post-stratum have the same net coverage as the census counts in the same Hispanic post-stratum but in New York. The synthetic assumption within post-strata will permit the 11   Census Bureau to draw conclusions from the A.C.E. sample about the population as a whole and then apply them to individuals living in geographic areas smaller than post-strata. The synthetic assumption is necessary to permit correction for small geographic areas based on a sample. This adjustment is only correcting for systematic biases and not local census errors. The error that is introduced when the synthetic assumption does not hold is called synthetic error. Synthetic estimation methodology is directed at correcting for a systematic under- or overcount in the census. The synthetic estimates will not result in the correction of random counting errors that occur for any entity (blocks tracts, counties, etc). Therefore, the synthetic estimate will not result in extreme changes in small geographic entities, nor will it correct for extreme errors. It is designed to remove the effects of systematic errors so that when small entities are aggregated, systematic and differential coverage errors are corrected. In the assessment of accuracy, the Census Bureau is concerned with synthetic error since it is not included directly in the total error model. The analysis of the effects of synthetic error were based on the construction of ""artificial populations."" These are populations that are created with surrogate variables that are known for the entire population, and are developed to reflect the distribution of net coverage error. This analysis of synthetic error and its effect on the loss functions was limited. Our additional analysis will expand the scope of the earlier artificial population work and add an approach using direct estimates of coverage at lower geographic levels. 1. Using Artificial Populations We will do a sensitivity analysis on the results from B-14. B-14 gave results for weighted and unweighted loss functions using one of two methods for distributing targets to post-strata and one of 8 models for correlation bias and percent of 1990 processing bias. This work will concentrate on the weighted loss functions and analyze the sensitivity of the B-14 results over both the methods for distributing targets to post-strata and all 8 models. Once again this analysis will be conducted for states and congressional districts. 2. Using Direct Estimates We will calculate direct DSEs for census divisions and for states having sufficient sample size to produce direct estimates with reasonably low variance. Assuming the resulting direct DSE population estimates are unbiased, the mean square error of the production synthetic estimate of total population will be estimated. E. Schedule Some of the A.C.E. evaluation work being undertaken involves field work and/or additional computer or clerical matching work. The Evaluation Followup Interview was conducted in the field during the winter of 2001. The Matching Error Study matching work was completed in the spring. Results from these studies are being processed, with initial data being available for review in early summer. Field and clerical work for the TES2 and TES3 12   (described in the attachment) studies began in the winter and will continue into July. Results from these studies won't be available for ESCAP review until later in the summer. Matching for the late census adds evaluation is scheduled for late-July, with data available for review in August. Other research is being conducted on a flow basis as data become available and analyses are conducted. The ESCAP began holding weekly (or more frequent) meetings to review analyses of data related to the topics of concern beginning on June 18. It is expected that all of the research and analyses described will be completed by the end of September. The ESCAP will then discuss how the results impact their concerns and will make a recommendation by midOctober as to whether adjusted or non-adjusted census data should be used for subsequent purposes. During the September through October time frame, analysts will document the results of their research in evaluation reports, finalizing them in time for release to the public concurrently with the ESCAP recommendation.  13   Attachment 3  Field Operations to Answer the Concerns About Lack of Balance In order to answer these concerns and explain the lack of balance present due to Targeted Extended Search (TES) and to explain the lack of balance that may be introduced due to TES, we will be examining the results of Targeted Extended Search 2 (TES2) and Targeted Extended Search 3 (TES3). TES2 followed up E-sample housing units that were coded as erroneous enumerations in the initial housing unit phase to determine if the unit was inside or outside the block cluster and surrounding rings. TES3 will followup other types of units, both P-sample and E-sample, that may contribute to a lack of balance. In TES2 we are evaluating the housing units coded during the housing unit matching as not existing as housing units within the cluster. The block containing the housing unit selected for additional geographic work and the surrounding blocks were identified on a map. The field representative identified the block where the housing unit existed and the housing unit was classified as: C C C C C Existing in the surrounding blocks Existing outside the surrounding blocks Existing within the block cluster Not a housing unit Unresolved  So, a housing unit may be coded as in surrounding blocks or outside the search area when it was part of the block cluster. In TES3 we are also sending to the field a sample of census housing units classified as correctly enumerated in the block cluster. If a housing unit was classified as correctly enumerated in the block cluster in error, the housing unit was not eligible for targeted extended search in person matching. This could explain more of the lack of balance identified in the person matching. In addition, we are sending additional types of P-sample cases for more geographic field work and a sample of matches in the sample block as a control. These types of cases are: C C C P-sample people matched in surrounding blocks Not matched P-sample housing units P-sample people matched in the sample block cluster"
GX251-15-8187951	"EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503  December 15, 2000 PROVISIONAL GUIDANCE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 1997 STANDARDS FOR FEDERAL DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY NOTE FOR READERS As a follow-on to OMB's October 1997 announcement of revised government-wide standards for Federal data on race and ethnicity, the Tabulation Working Group of the Interagency Committee for the Review of Standards for Data on Race and Ethnicity has recently issued ""Provisional Guidance on the Implementation of the 1997 Standards for the Collection of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity."" The guidance presented in this document is intended for any Federal agencies or organizational units that maintain, collect, or present data on race and ethnicity for Federal statistical purposes, program administrative reporting, or civil rights compliance reporting. This is a substantially updated version of the earlier guidance that was made available in February 1999. It reflects public comments on the previous version as well as the Tabulation Working Group's further research and deliberations. The guidance, which was requested by Federal agencies and the many users of data on race and ethnicity, continues to be developed with the involvement of these constituencies. By design, this guidance does not cover all of the specific issues individual agencies will need to address during their implementation of the 1997 standards. The guidance for implementing the 1997 standards focuses on three areas: collecting data, tabulating data, and building bridges to compare data collected under the 1997 and the 1977 standards. In some areas work is ongoing, and the guidance will be updated as additional research and analyses are completed. We expect that the guidance will evolve further as data from Census 2000 and other data collections employing the 1997 collection standards become available, as agencies address implementation issues in their respective programs, and as additional research needs are identified and addressed. In keeping with the process that guided the development of the 1997 standards for data on race and ethnicity, we are looking forward to a continuing dialogue on this provisional guidance. We welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions. Katherine K. Wallman Chief Statistician   PROVISIONAL GUIDANCE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 1997 STANDARDS FOR FEDERAL DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY  Prepared By Tabulation Working Group Interagency Committee for the Review of Standards for Data on Race and Ethnicity December 15, 2000   Table of Contents Chapter 1.

The guidance complements the Federal Government's decision in October 1997 to provide an opportunity for individuals to select one or more races when responding to agency requests for data on race and ethnicity. To foster comparability across data collections carried out by various agencies, it is useful for those agencies to report responses of more than one race using some standardized tabulations or formats. The report briefly explains why the tabulation guidelines are needed, reviews the general guidance issued when the standards were adopted in October 1997, and provides information on the criteria used in developing the guidelines. This report also addresses a larger set of implementation questions that have emerged during the working group's deliberations. Thus, the report considers: C C C C Collecting data on race and ethnicity using the 1997 standards; Tabulating Census 2000 data as well as data on race and ethnicity collected in surveys and from administrative records; Using data on race and ethnicity in applications such as legislative redistricting, civil rights monitoring and enforcement, and population estimates; and Comparing data under the 1997 and the 1977 standards when conducting trend analyses.  In addition, the appendices to the report provide the full text of reports on the research that has been conducted in two areas: approaches for collecting data on race and ethnicity, and approaches for bridging between data collected under the 1997 standards and data collected under the 1977 standards. The guidelines are necessarily provisional pending the availability of data from Census 2000 and other data systems as the 1997 standards are implemented. The guidelines provide a general framework and are not intended to cover all aspects of problems that agencies will encounter during their implementation of the 1997 standards. In some instances, for example, specific implementation issues are being address through OMB's paperwork review of data collections. The guidelines are likely to be reviewed and refined as Federal agencies and others gain experience with data collected under the 1997 standards. 5   CHAPTER 1 BACKGROUND This chapter discusses why guidance is needed for tabulating data collected using the 1997 standards, reiterates the general guidance issued when the standards were adopted in October 1997, provides clarification of several aspects of the standards, and presents the criteria that were developed for evaluating bridging methods and presenting data. A. Need for Tabulation Guidelines On October 30, 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published ""Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity"" (Federal Register, 62 FR 58781 - 58790)(see Appendix A). The 1997 standards reflect a change in data collection policy, making it possible for Federal agencies to collect information that reflects the increasing diversity of our Nation's population stemming from growth in interracial marriages and immigration. Under the new policy, agencies are now required to offer respondents the option of selecting one or more of the following five racial categories included in the 1997 standards: -- American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. -- Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. -- Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used in addition to ""Black or African American."" -- Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. -- White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. These five categories are the minimum set for data on race for Federal statistics, program administrative reporting, and civil rights compliance reporting. With respect to ethnicity, the standards provide for the collection of data on whether or not a person is of ""Hispanic or Latino"" culture or origin. (The standards do not permit a multiple response that would indicate an ethnic heritage that is both ""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino."") This category is defined as follows: 6   -- Hispanic or Latino. A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, ""Spanish origin,"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic or Latino."" As a result of the change in policy for collecting data on race, the reporting categories used to present these data must similarly reflect this change. In keeping with the spirit of the 1997 standards, agencies cannot collect multiple responses and then report and publish data using only the five single race categories. Agencies are expected to provide as much detail as possible on the multiple race responses, consistent with agency confidentiality and data quality criteria. As provided by the standards, OMB will consider any agency variances to this policy on a case by case basis. Based on agency research prior to the issuance of the 1997 standards, it was estimated that less than two percent of the Nation's total population was likely to identify with more than one race. This percentage may increase as those who identify with more than one racial heritage become aware of the opportunity to report more than one race. As compared with data collected on adults, data collected on children and youth, however, are likely to reflect larger numbers and percentages of respondents reporting themselves as belonging to more than one racial group. In the early years of the standards' implementation, there will be issues of data quality and confidentiality related to sample size that may restrict the amount of data that can be published for some combinations of multiple race responses. Over time, however, the size of these data cells may increase. It should be noted that such data quality and confidentiality problems for small population groups also existed under the 1977 standards, where sample sizes sometimes prevented presentation of data on certain population groups such as American Indians. The possible multiple race combinations under the 1997 standards, some with small data cells, serve to make such data quality concerns more apparent. Some balance will need to be struck between having a tabulation showing the full distribution of all possible combinations of multiple race responses and presenting only the minimum -- that is, a single aggregate of people who reported more than one race. When the standards were announced on October 30, 1997, they became effective immediately for all new and revised Federal record keeping or reporting requirements that included data on race and ethnicity. All existing Federal record keeping or reporting requirements must be made consistent with the provisions of the 1997 standards at the time they are submitted to OMB for extension through the reports clearance process, or no later than January 1, 2003. As provided by the standards, an agency must make a request to OMB for any variation from the standards. B. General Guidelines for Tabulating Data on Race In response to concerns that had been raised about how Federal agencies would tabulate multiple race responses, OMB in the October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice issued the following general guidance:  7   C  Consistent with criteria for confidentiality and data quality, the tabulation procedures used by the agencies should result in the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as possible. Guidelines for tabulation ultimately must meet the needs of at least two groups within the Federal Government, with the overriding objective of providing the most accurate and informative body of data. The first group is composed of those Federal Government officials charged with carrying out constitutional and legislative mandates, such as redistricting legislatures, enforcing civil rights laws, and monitoring progress in antidiscrimination programs. (The legislative redistricting file produced by the Bureau of the Census, also known as the Public Law 94-171 file, is an example of a file meeting such legislative needs.) The second group consists of the staff of Federal statistical agencies producing and analyzing data that are used to monitor economic and social conditions and trends. Many of the needs of the first group can be met with an initial tabulation that provides, consistent with standards for data quality and confidentiality, the full detail of racial reporting; that is, the number of people reporting in each single race category and the number reporting in each of the possible combinations of races, which would add to the total population. Depending on the judgment of users, the combinations of multiple responses could be collapsed. (1) One method would be to provide separate totals for those reporting in the most common multiple race combinations and to collapse the data for other less frequently reported combinations. The specifics of the collapsed distributions would be dependent on the results of particular data collections. (2) A second method would be to report the total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination with other races. These totals would represent upper bounds on the size of the populations who identified with each of the racial categories. In some cases, this latter method could be used for comparing data collected under the old standards with data collected under the 1997 standards.  C  C  C  C C  It is important that Federal agencies with the same or closely related responsibilities adopt consistent tabulation methods. Regardless of the method chosen for collapsing multiple race responses, Federal agencies must make available the total number reporting more than one race, if confidentiality and data quality requirements can be met, in order to ensure that any changes in response patterns resulting from the 1997 standards can be monitored over time.  8     Different tabulation procedures might be required to meet various needs of Federal agencies for data on race. Nevertheless, Federal agencies often need to compare racial and ethnic data. Hence, some standardization of tabulation categories for reporting data on race is desirable to facilitate such comparisons.  The October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice identified four areas where further research was needed on how to tabulate data: (1) How should the data be used to evaluate conformance with program objectives in the area of equal employment opportunity and other anti-discrimination programs? (2) How should the decennial census data for many small population groups with multiple racial heritages be used to develop sample designs and survey controls for major demographic surveys? (3) How should the 1997 standards be introduced in the vital statistics program which obtains the number of births and deaths from administrative records, but uses intercensal population estimates in determining the rates of births and deaths? (4) And more generally, how can meaningful comparisons be made of data collected under the previous standards and data that will be collected under the 1997 standards? In order to address these and other issues and to ensure that tabulation methodologies would be carefully developed and coordinated among the Federal agencies, OMB assembled a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from the Federal agencies that generate or use these data. This group has considered tabulation issues and developed the provisional guidance that is presented in this report for use by Federal agencies. The work of this group has included: (1) a review of Federal data needs and uses to ensure that the tabulation guidelines produce data that meet statutory and program requirements; (2) cognitive testing of the wording of questions; (3) cognitive testing of a form for reporting aggregate data; (4) evaluation of different methods of bridging from the 1997 to the 1977 standards; and (5) development of guidelines for presenting data on multiple race responses that meet accepted data quality and confidentiality standards. The tabulation guidance in this report is necessarily provisional pending the availability of Census 2000 data and other data series as the 1997 standards are implemented. These guidelines will be reviewed and modified as agencies and other data users gain experience with data collected using the 1997 standards. C. Interpretation of Self-Reported Data on Race It is important to remember that the Federal racial and ethnic data categories are social-political constructs and that they should not be interpreted as being genetic, biological, or anthropological in nature. Data on race and ethnicity have historically been collected in the decennial census, but the categories for collecting and tabulating these data have changed numerous times. These 9   changes have reflected the shifts in the racial makeup of the population and changes in social attitudes and political concerns. The standard was developed in the mid-1970's in large measure to provide comparable data to monitor equal access in areas such as housing, education, mortgage lending, health care services, and employment for population groups that historically had experienced discrimination and differential treatment because of their race or ethnicity. By using the standard to tabulate data in these areas by race and ethnicity, it is possible to compare disparities across data systems. While the Federal categories provide a standardized format for purposes of collecting and presenting data on race and ethnicity, the standard was not designed to capture the full complexity of race and ethnicity in the United States. This context is important for understanding why the Federal Government collects data on race and ethnicity and for interpreting these data. The 1997 standards emphasize self-reporting or self-identification as the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. The standards do not establish criteria or qualifications (such as blood quantum levels) that are to be used in determining a particular individual's racial or ethnic classification. They do not tell an individual who he or she is, or specify how an individual should classify himself or herself. Self-identification for race and Hispanic or Latino origin means that the responses are based on self-perception and therefore are subjective, but by definition, the responses are accurate. In situations where self-reporting is not practicable or feasible, such as identification by personnel of funeral homes, observer identification may be used. Because the 1997 standard allows individuals to report one or more races, the importance of self-identification is underscored; it is generally difficult for observers to report an individual's multiple racial heritages. As mentioned above, a consequence of using self-identification is that unless a person is purposely misreporting, there are no wrong answers even if ""objective"" clues suggest otherwise. This contrasts with the collection of information on other demographic characteristics. For example, if someone born on January 1, 1950, indicates that he or she is 30 years of age when asked on January 1, 2000, the researcher views this as an error and corrects the information. The use of self-identification coupled with the social nature of race also results in situations where an individual's response to questions on race may change over time as a result of the maturation process, the particular situation, and the changing environment. If a data collection strategy used to measure age were to produce such results, that strategy would be abandoned; in the case of race, however, such change is acceptable and expected. The dynamic nature of the concept of race and how the population views it as well as the circumstances under which the data are collected need to be considered in the interpretation and analysis of these data. An example of how the social dimension of race is incorporated into the collection of information is the large increase in the percent of the population identifying as American Indians between the 1970 and 1980 censuses. A standard interpretation of population increase focuses on the basic demographic processes of mortality, natality, and immigration. In this instance, these processes could not explain this increase. On the other hand, it would be equally wrong to conclude that persons misreported their race in either 1970 or 1980. The increase reflects societal changes  10   related to the perception of American Indian heritage and how these changes affect how individuals self-identify. Another example relates to multiple race identity. One way to define ""objectively"" a multiple race individual would be to assess the race of each of the parents. It is possible to identify a population in this way from data sets that collect information on the characteristics of family members. This approach becomes increasingly complex in situations where parents are also of multiple races, leading to questions about how much of a given racial heritage the respondent considers ""enough"" to report. Analyses show that not all persons with parents of different races identify as having more than one race. It also appears that the probability of identifying multiple races changes with the age of the individual as well as with the specific races of the parents. How individuals come to their self-identification is an important research issue that would require collection of data beyond the minimum set of categories and which would not be feasible to incorporate into all data collection systems. In interpreting and evaluating the results of analyses that are based on data collected using the 1997 standards, it is important to remember that the approach can only capture selected aspects of a complex dimension, and that what is captured will be affected by strong and complex social processes. As more detailed data are collected, and analyses that directly address these social processes are conducted, the interpretation of the information collected more routinely under the 1997 standard will be clearer. D. Points of Clarification Regarding the 1997 Standards This section elaborates on several points in the standards that have been a source of confusion for some users. Under the 1997 standards, ""Hispanic or Latino"" is clearly designated as an ethnicity and not as a race. Whether or not an individual is Hispanic or Latino, every effort should be made to ascertain the race or races with which an individual identifies. The two-question format, with the ethnicity question preceding the race question, should be used when information is collected through self-identification. Although the standards permit the use of a combined question when collecting data by observer identification, the use of the twoquestion format is strongly encouraged even where observer identification is used. Regardless of the question format, observers are expected to attempt to identify the individual's race(s). The standards require that at a minimum the total number of persons identifying with more than one race be reported. (A response that includes, for example, two or more Asian groups is not a multiple race response.) It is stressed that this is a minimum; agencies are strongly encouraged to report detailed information on specific racial combinations subject to constraints of data reliability and confidentiality standards. In this regard, agencies are expected to report only those categories that meet their current reliability and confidentiality standards. Thus, the reporting of 11   individual categories is likely to be more detailed when the overall racial distribution is reported than when characteristics by race (such as, for example, income by race ) are reported. The following wording in the standards concerning the reporting of data when the combined question is used is clarified in the paragraph below: ""In cases where data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting `Hispanic or Latino and one or more races' and the total number of respondents reporting `more than one race' (regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided."" (Section 2b of the standards) A complete tabulation of race by ethnicity should always be reported when confidentiality permits. If not, at least ethnicity by the single races and ethnicity for those reporting more than one race should be given. Thus, an Hispanic or Latino respondent reporting one race should be reported both as Hispanic or Latino and as a member of that single race. Reporting a composite - such as the number of people who responded ""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""more than one race"" -is a minimum that should be used only if more detailed reporting would violate data reliability and confidentiality standards. The rules discussed in Section 4 of the 1997 standards concerning the presentation of data on race and ethnicity under special circumstances are not to be invoked unilaterally by an agency. If the agency believes the standard categories are inappropriate, the agency must request a specific variance from OMB. The 1997 standards do not include an ""other race"" category. For Census 2000, OMB granted an exception to the Census Bureau to use a category called ""Some Other Race."" OMB has also granted an exception to the National Center for Health Statistics to include ""Some Other Race"" on the U.S. standard birth and death certificates in order to maintain comparability between the demographically related data systems of vital statistics and the decennial census. E. Criteria Used in Developing the Tabulation Guidelines The interagency tabulation working group generated criteria that could be used both to evaluate the technical merits of different bridging procedures (see Chapter 5 and Appendix C) and to display data under the 1997 standards. The relative importance of each criterion will depend on the purpose for which the data are intended to be used. For example, in the case of bridging to the 1977 standards, the most important criterion is ""measuring change over time,"" while ""congruence with respect to respondent's choice"" will be more critical for presenting data under the 1997 standards. The criteria set forth below are designed only to assess the technical adequacy of the various statistical procedures. The first two criteria listed below are central to consideration of bridging methods. The next six criteria apply both to bridging and long-term tabulation decisions. The  12   last criterion is of primary importance for future tabulations of data collected using the 1997 standards. Bridging: Measure change over time. This is the most important criterion for bridging because the major purpose of any historical bridge will be to measure true change over time as distinct from methodologically induced change. The ideal bridging method, under this criterion, would be one that matches how the respondent would have responded under the 1977 standards had that been possible. In this ideal situation, differences between the new distribution and the old distribution would reflect true change in the distribution itself. Minimize disruptions to the single race distribution. This criterion applies only to methods for bridging. Its purpose is to consider how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the 1997 standards. To the extent that a bridging method can meet the other criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportion in the ongoing distribution, it will facilitate looking both forward and backward in time. Bridging and future tabulations: Range of applicability. Because the purpose of the guidelines is to foster consistency across agencies in tabulating racial and ethnic data, tabulation procedures that can be used in a wide range of programs and varied contexts are usually preferable to those that have more limited applicability. Meet confidentiality and reliability standards. It is essential that the tabulations maintain the confidentiality standards of the statistical organization while producing reliable estimates. Statistically defensible. Because tabulations may be published by statistical agencies and/or provided in public use data, the recommended tabulation procedures should follow recognized statistical practices. Ease of use. Because the tabulation procedures are likely to be used in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they can be implemented with a minimum of operational difficulty. Thus, the tabulation procedures must be capable of being easily replicated by others. Skill required. Similarly, it is important that the tabulation procedures can be implemented by individuals with relatively little statistical knowledge. Understandability and communicability. Again, because the tabulation procedures will likely be used, as well as presented, in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they be easily explainable to the public. 13   Future tabulations: Congruence with respondent's choice. Because of changes in the categories and the respondent instructions accompanying the question on race (allowing one or more categories to be selected), the underlying logic of the tabulation procedures must reflect to the greatest extent possible the full detail of race reporting. CHAPTER 2 COLLECTING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY USING THE 1997 STANDARDS This chapter provides guidelines for use by agencies in developing data collection questions, formats, and associated procedures to implement the 1997 standards. A. Developing Procedures for Data Collection An interagency committee representing the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, and the General Accounting Office conducted two phases of cognitive research to develop and test procedures to collect and aggregate data on race and ethnicity using the 1997 standards. This chapter briefly describes the research conducted by the committee and offers initial guidelines for agencies developing data collection procedures. These guidelines will be continually reviewed and modified as implementation of the 1997 standards occurs, feedback from agencies is received, and new research findings become available. The guidelines in this chapter address the wording and format of questions that ask for self-reported data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin as well as the design of forms that collect aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin. Instructions and training procedures for field interviewers and administrative personnel who will be using these questions and forms are also discussed. 1. Developing and Testing Self-Reported Race and Ethnicity Questions A goal of this research was to provide guidance on the wording and format of questions for selfreported race and Hispanic or Latino origin, depending on the data collection mode. The interagency committee conducted research on survey questions administered by telephone or in face-to-face personal interviews. In addition, the Census Bureau conducted extensive research on the design of questions in preparation for Census 2000. Both short and long versions of questions were tested. For short versions of the race question, the five minimum response categories were usedthey are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Long versions of the race question provided for reporting of subgroups such as Chinese, Japanese, Samoan, and so forth. For Hispanic or Latino origin questions, the minimum level of detail used  14   was a Yes or No response indicating Hispanic or Latino origin background. Long versions of the question provided for reporting of subgroups such as Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Mexican. Below is a brief description of the methods used in the two phases of research conducted by the interagency committee followed by the results and their implications. This section concludes with general guidelines to use in collecting self-reported data on race and ethnicity and offers specific examples of question wording and format. Research Methods. In Phase I, 44 cognitive laboratory interviews were completed, 33 face-toface and 11 by telephone. Interviews were conducted in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Subjects were grouped for analysis purposes according to their reports of the race of their mother and father. Among the 44 subjects, 15 reported both parents as Black or African American, 10 reported both parents as White, 2 reported both parents as Asian, 2 reported both parents as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 2 reported both parents as American Indian or Alaska Native, 6 reported their mother's race as different from their father's race, and 7 reported some other response (e.g., Hispanic or country of origin). Of the 6 subjects who reported multiple race backgrounds, 3 reported American Indian or Alaska Native in combination with either Black or African American or White, 2 reported Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander in combination with either Asian or White, and 1 reported Asian and White. Ten of the 44 subjects were of Hispanic or Latino origin. In Phase II, a total of 82 cognitive interviews were conducted in four locations: New York, NY; Tulsa, OK; Sacramento, CA; and Honolulu, HI. Half of the interviews tested items designed for face-to-face surveys and the remaining half tested items designed for telephone administration. As in Phase I, subjects in Phase II were grouped for analysis purposes according to their reports of the race(s) of their mother and father. One of the purposes of the Phase II research was to test race and ethnicity questions specifically with subjects who were Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and of multiple race backgrounds. Among the 82 subjects, 17 subjects reported their parents as Hispanic; these subjects were not further categorized by race for analysis purposes. Sixteen reported both parents as Asian, 16 reported both parents as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 14 reported both parents as American Indian or Alaska Native, and19 reported their mother's race as different from their father's race. During the cognitive interviews, subjects were probed extensively about their racial and ethnic backgrounds. Based on this information, among the 19 subjects reporting more than one race, 5 were American Indian and White, 3 were Black and White, 3 were American Indian or Alaska Native, Black, and White, 2 were Asian and White, 2 were American Indian or Alaska Native and Black, 2 were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and Asian, 1 was Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and White, and 1 was Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, and White. All research subjects were asked general demographic questions (e.g., age, education, and marital status) as well as the test versions of questions on Hispanic or Latino origin and race. Respondents were also asked to provide proxy data for all members of their household. Then,  15   debriefings were conducted to learn more about the subjects' understanding of the questions and terms used. Findings. Generally, subjects were able to answer without difficulty the race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared. However, individual differences were found in the interpretation and meaning of terms used and there was obvious confusion among some subjects regarding the separation of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. In debriefings, some subjects who were of Hispanic or Latino origin said they usually report Hispanic (or some variation indicating Hispanic status or country of origin) when answering surveys or government forms that ask race. As expected, subjects who were interviewed face-to-face seemed to use and rely on the flashcards to select a response. Subjects interviewed by telephone had more difficulty answering the race question and the long version of the Hispanic question since they had to listen to a relatively long list of response options. There was some indication that hearing a list with alternative terms representing one category (i.e., Black or African American is one category, not two) may result in confusion. A few subjects thought the interviewer asked them to choose between Black or African American and commented that they did not like having to make a choice. This problem can be addressed through interviewer training that teaches the interviewer to pause longer after saying each response category; that is, if the interviewer is reading a list of ""...White, Black or African American, Asian, ..."" she/he should pause between the words White and Black, not pause between Black or African American, and pause again between African American and Asian. Last, there was some evidence that hearing the instruction to ""Select one or more..."" was misunderstood on the telephone to mean that the subject had to select more than one race. Interviewers will need to be trained to perceive and correct for this. Implications. As has been noted elsewhere in the literature, respondents often do not make clear distinctions among the terms and concepts used in defining race, ethnicity, nationality, and ancestry. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared but individual differences in the interpretation and meaning of terms used were found, as was confusion regarding the distinction of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. The following statements from the cognitive interviews illustrate these findings. C It means ethnic background. Not the country. I think people tend to cross quickly between using the terms race and country. When I say, ""Yes, I am Hawaiian,"" I mean that in my bloodstream I have Hawaii. My blood inheritance. Race I guess means the color somebody is. Or, their cultural heritage. The word race means the biological heritage from which you descend. Race means the culture that someone is from.  C C C  16   C  The way I think of race, I think of it as a negative, probably because of what we've read about in the 60's--race riots, etc. It always seems to have a negative connotation. I prefer to use ethnicity. I answer differently sometimes, depending on what's beneficial to my family or me. Sometimes you see Hispanic as a choice for race. If Hispanic had been offered as a race then I would have chosen that. The race question is difficult because it doesn't have enough categories, it's too restrictive. With only five categories, there are two that are too specific--American Indian and Native Hawaiian--and there's a list of countries for the Asians. It doesn't specify anything about Central or South American descent. Everybody comes from different backgrounds; even White Americans can probably check off Irish, etc.  C C C  General Guidelines. Based on work accomplished by the interagency committee as well as the testing of questions in a variety of modes and with subjects of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, the following guidelines and examples for the design of questions on race and ethnicity are offered: C Communicate clearly an instruction that allows, but does not require, multiple responses to the race question. The 1997 standards are clear that the format and wording used in a question on race must communicate to the respondent an instruction that multiple responses are acceptable. Based on research findings, the recommended forms for this instruction are Select one or more, Mark one or more, or Choose one or more. There was some limited research indicating that the wording ""...one or more..."" was better understood than a ""Mark all that apply"" alternative. Other instructions may be needed, especially when integrating a race question within an existing data collection instrument. For example, some mail instruments do not word questions in a personal way; that is, rather than What is your age? an instrument may simply have Age with a line for an entry. Taking this case further, if a form has an item simply worded as Race with a line for an entry, then an instruction should be included to communicate that multiple race responses are acceptable (e.g., Race - enter one or more). Regardless of exact wording, the instruction must be evident to the respondent. C Consider using an instruction to answer both the question on Hispanic or Latino origin question and the question on race. Using an instruction has particular relevance for mail surveys or questionnaires that are selfadministered since there is no opportunity for interviewer interaction. An instruction such as the following that was used in Census 2000 may improve potential item non-response, especially among Hispanic respondents: NOTE: Please answer BOTH Questions 4 and 5 (Hispanic or Latino and Race). 17   C  For data collection efforts requiring detailed Hispanic or Latino origin or detailed race information, consider a two-part question or follow-up questions asked by the interviewer or printed on a form. For example, respondents who first report being of Hispanic or Latino origin would then be asked if they are Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and so forth. Take mode of administration carefully into account when designing questions and instructions. This guideline may seem obvious but it is often the case that surveys are conducted using more than one mode (i.e., the initial interview attempt may be a personal visit but a telephone interview is permissible). Since the questions should be designed with the mode in mind, there may need to be different versions of questions, depending on the mode of administration.  C  C  Provide definitions to the minimum race categories when possible. This guideline is particularly relevant when the short version (only the five minimum categories) of a question on race is used. Individual interpretation of the five categories could lead to response error, especially for respondents unsure of the definitions of Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander. For self-administered forms, providing the definition of the category should be considered if space and formatting limitations can be overcome. For interviewer-administered questions, the definitions should be readily available to the interviewer (usually in a manual that provides question-by-question specifications or a pop-up screen if the interview is computer-assisted) to assist the respondent if needed.  C  Adhere to the specific terminology for the racial and ethnic categories as stated in the 1997 standards. The 1997 standards address the words and terms to use, and also indicate other terms that can be considered. For example, the title of the previous Black category should be revised to Black or African American and additional terms such as Haitian or Negro can be used if desired. In another example, American Indian should be used and Native American should not be substituted for American Indian. Reviewing the terms specified in the revised standards is strongly encouraged before designing questions on race and Hispanic or Latino origin.  Specific Guidelines on Question Wording and Format. The examples below are based on numerous discussions with interagency committee members, recommendations by questionnaire design experts, and testing results from both the interagency committee's research as well as research conducted by the Census Bureau in preparation for Census 2000. It is important to remember that other variations of questions on ethnicity and race may work just as well or better in a particular survey or data collection environment. There is not ""one right way"" to ask an individual to report his/her race and ethnicity. Rather, question wording and format should 18   depend on the mode of administration as well as the context in which the questions are being asked. For ease of reference, the following list first provides examples for use in a face-to-face or personal visit mode of data collection, followed by telephone and then self-administration (usually thought of as a mail survey, but also could be used for forms and applications filled out by an individual). There are examples of questions that ask Hispanic or Latino origin as well as questions that ask for reports of race. It is important to recognize that as agencies implement the 1997 revised standards, more will be learned about which question formats work best. Thus, OMB does not at this time recommend one example of question wording or format over another. Also, OMB does not recommend a particular order of categories. There are advantages and disadvantages to various approaches such as an alphabetic ordering versus the ordering of the most prevalent group followed by groups less prevalent. The ordering shown reflects the ordering used in the testing of these questions.

Developing and Testing Aggregate Reporting Forms Implementing the 1997 standards will cause fundamental changes to the ways in which data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin have previously been aggregated and reported. As a result, a second goal of the interagency committee's research is to provide guidance on the design of reporting forms that will be used by administrative personnel to aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin for a given population (e.g., reporting race and ethnicity for a school population). Initial research efforts. Three different types of forms were tested with eighteen subjects who were familiar with reporting aggregate data for a given population, but not necessarily familiar with the 1997 standards. Of the 18 respondents interviewed, 6 worked for the Federal Government, 8 worked in private industry, 3 worked in local correctional facilities, and 1 worked in a school. None of the forms tested were completed accurately without interviewer intervention. Regardless of the form tested or whether the testing was conducted in a laboratory or on-site, the most common problem was the requirement to count and report race for individuals who are of Hispanic or Latino origin. As an illustration, one subject stated ""It's (the form) basically asking how Hispanics were separated into groups of races. I think the part that confuses me is that our Hispanics do not view themselves as another race. And so that is kind of what threw me off... it's asking for Hispanics who had marked `White,' but they don't. They would have checked Hispanic."" Discussions with subjects revealed that all but one worked for agencies that have used a single question -- a combined race and ethnicity format -- to collect data. Rather than continuing the testing of different draft forms, work shifted in FY 2000 to establishing guidance for Federal enforcement agencies that collect, use, and/or report aggregate data on race. This work culminated in the March 9, 2000, issuance of OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, Guidance on Aggregation and Allocation of Data on Race for Use in Civil Rights Monitoring and Enforcement (see Chapter 4 for further discussion on the implementation of this bulletin). The aggregation method described in the bulletin keeps intact the five single race categories and includes the four double race combinations most frequently reported in recent studies. The method also provides for the collection of information on any multiple race combinations that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest. A balance category is provided to aggregate and report those individual responses that are not included in (1) one of the five single race categories or four double race combinations or (2) other combinations that represent more than one percent of the population in a jurisdiction. Appendix B contains the bulletin and an example agencies could use to design aggregate reporting forms.  24   Guidelines. Even though there were many problems found in developing and testing aggregate forms, the following initial guidelines can be offered:   If possible (notwithstanding confidentiality and disclosure issues), allow for the reporting of every combination of multiple race responses. If every combination cannot be reported because of burden and/or confidentiality concerns, include at a minimum the following 10 categories described in Bulletin 0002.            American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of individuals reporting more than one race  If the categories described in Bulletin 00-02 are used, also include to the greatest extent possible any aggregate counts of multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population of interest or study. Provide definitions that assist in understanding the concepts of single race responses and multiple race responses as well as the distinction between ethnicity and race. Explain how the missing data should be reported. Design the form in a professional manner and include clear instructions. When feasible, consider providing information to respondents about how multiple race responses will be aggregated and reported to a Federal enforcement agency. For example, employers may want to include on employment applications the following information:       25   Below are two questions--the first is about your ethnicity and the second your race. You are to answer both questions. In answering the second question, you may select one or more races. The summarized information is reported to the Federal Government for civil rights enforcement purposes. The summarized information will be reported in the following categories only: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. White Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Black or African American and White Asian and White American Indian or Alaska Native and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of all other individuals selecting more than one race.  If you select races that are not in categories 1 through 9 above, you will be counted in 10, which is the balance of all other individuals selecting more than one race. For example, if you select Asian and Black and White, your race will be reported in the balance category.  3. Developing Field Instructions and Training Procedures Work to develop interviewer instructions and interviewer training procedures has only recently begun. Long-term plans include developing and testing different training modules and interviewer instructions, depending on the mode of administration and the type of data collection. This work will, in all likelihood, address in a more systematic way some longstanding issues in the fielding of questions on race and ethnicity and ways that interviewers can be trained to improve data quality. Specific procedures on how to ask the questions and, in some cases, how to instruct the respondent to use the flashcard, will be developed along with suggested interviewer probes, definitions, and statements that can be used to address respondent problems. During the cognitive testing of the race and ethnicity questions, interviewer training and field procedures were also tested. Specifically, interviewers were trained to administer the questions in a standardized manner as would be done in actual survey interviews. (Cognitive probing was conducted after the questions were administered.) As is common in actual surveys, the interviewers were also supplied with a ""Question and Answer"" sheet to assist in responding to questions and confusion on the part of respondents. The interviewers experienced the greatest difficulty in assisting Hispanic or Latino respondents who were having trouble answering the question on race. If a respondent answered ""I'm Hispanic or Latino"" (or some other term for Hispanic), the interviewers were trained to point the respondent back to the race categories by responding with something like ""In addition to being Hispanic, can you describe yourself as [repeat race categories]?"" Also, if a respondent insisted that Hispanic or Latino was a race or asked why it wasn't on the list of races, the interviewer was trained to say that ""Hispanic or Latino is generally considered an ethnicity rather than a 26   raceHispanic or Latino persons can be of any race."" This study found these kinds of interviewer explanations to be mostly ineffective and in fact, some respondents found them to be offensive. The research team concluded that interviewers should rely on standard probing techniques to encourage respondents to place their answer into an explicit response category, and to repeat the categories if necessary. Clearly, more research is needed in this area as the 1997 standards become more widely implemented. B. Processing Census 2000 Data Using the 1997 Standards This section provides an overview of the procedures the Census Bureau is following in editing responses to the Census 2000 race and Hispanic origin questions and imputing responses to these questions for people who did not provide them. A comparison of these procedures with those implemented in the 1990 census is shown at the end of this section. The process can be divided into five parts: pre-editing procedures, within-household imputation, ""hot deck"" imputation, substitution, and group quarters editing. The basic philosophy in performing editing and imputation operations is that the Census Bureau has enough subjectmatter expertise and access to related information provided by the respondent, by others in the respondent's household, or by other people similar to the respondent to make reasonable imputations of missing responses. In cases where answers are not responsive to the question, they are removed and new responses are imputed. As part of its effort to inform the public about data quality, the Census Bureau publishes the degree to which it imputes responses for each question. In addition, the Census Bureau indicates in its microdata files which responses for a given record have been imputed. A certain amount of editing of responses occurs during coding operations, which precede the implementation of formal editing and imputation procedures. For example, during the coding of write-in responses to the question on race, coders must determine how national origin or ethnic group responses, such as Jamaican and German, should be coded into racial categories. The Census Bureau developed an approach for assigning race codes to responses that represent national origins or ethnic groups (excluding American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, Asian subgroups, and Pacific Islander groups) and the results of this approach are reflected in the race code list and in the coding procedures.1  1 Data on single ancestry by race from the 1990 census were used to help make decisions about how to code these responses into racial categories. Essentially, if 90 percent or more of people who reported a single, specific ancestry reported in a specific race category in 1990 (for example, 97 percent of people indicating Jamaican ancestry reported as Black in the question on race), then that race is used as the Census 2000 response. This 90percent rule was not applied to write-in responses of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, Asian groups, or Pacific Islander groups because the question on race was designed explicitly to obtain these types of responses.  27   1. Pre-editing Procedures Purpose: To convert input codes into standard three-digit output codes, detect and correct out-ofrange values, ensure that no more than eight2 race codes appear on the edited file, and resolve into one code multiple responses given to the question on Hispanic origin. (Please note that all original responses are preserved on the unedited files.) Tasks: Race  The pre-editing procedures include the following operations to assign three-digit codes for responses to this question:     Convert check box marks into corresponding three-digit codes; Ensure that write-in codes obtained from the coding operations are valid;3 Eliminate duplicate codes; and Remove general codes when more specific codes are provided (for example, if the check box code for American Indian and Alaska Native and a code for a tribe are present, the check box code is eliminated). than eight race codes are sent as output as much information as possible about detailed Asian and Pacific Islander of all other major racial groups such as  The pre-editing procedures then ensure that no more to the edited file. The goal in this process is to retain American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and about groups while, at the same time, preserving reporting White, Black, and Some other race. Hispanic origin  Pre-editing procedures for the Hispanic origin question are considerably simpler because there is only one write-in space and respondents are not asked to report multiple origins. The 2 Although it is possible for more than eight race codes to be input during data processing (including coding), no more than eight race codes are kept on the edited files that are used for data products. For example, people may provide multiple ethnic responses (such as German, Italian, Jamaican, and Nigerian) in addition to multiple check box responses and write-in responses of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes or Asian and Pacific Islander groups, possibly resulting in eight or more input race codes. Results from the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal show that of people reporting more than one race, the overwhelming majority report only two races. Thus, storing up to eight race codes in the output files preserves, as much as possible, the original groups reported. 3 In rare cases, invalid codes may have been applied inadvertently to a particular write-in response. Although extensive efforts are made to identify and correct these situations, the editing procedures act as a backup system for resolving any remaining problems.  28   philosophy of the procedures, however, is similar to that for the race question. Some specific examples include:    Convert check box marks into corresponding three-digit codes; Ensure that write-in codes are valid; Override the general code for the ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino"" check box with the specific code for any origin that is written in. For example, the code for a write-in response of ""Guatemalan"" (code 222) replaces the check box code for ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/ Latino"" (code 280); and Reduce multiple check boxes marked for a respondent to one output code. 4    For research purposes, all responses, including reporting of multiple responses, are retained . 2. Within-Household Imputation Purpose: When race or Hispanic origin data are missing, to impute responses for people from others within the same household who have reported race or Hispanic origin. Tasks: This part of the editing procedures is performed jointly for the race and Hispanic origin questions. They involve the following steps:    Identify people in the household for whom no response was given to either or both the Hispanic origin question and the race question; Search to see if an Hispanic origin response can be obtained from a write-in response to the question on race; and Search to see if a race response can be obtained from a write-in response to the question on Hispanic origin  After these preliminary steps, the within-household editing procedures follow one of three paths using a predetermined sequence of household relationship to assign race and origin depending on  4 If more than one response was given, obtaining a single response will be achieved as follows: (1) If all the responses are Hispanic, the respondent will be assigned as ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."" (2) If all the responses are not Hispanic, the respondent will be assigned as ""Not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."" (3) If the responses are a mix of Hispanic and non-Hispanic responses, the responses will be blanked and a single origin will be imputed either, first, from within the household or, if no one in the household gave a single response, from other neighboring households with members of the same race.  29   whether both race and origin and origin are blank, the race predetermined sequence with procedures for imputing only  are blank, only race is blank, or only origin is blank.5 If both race and origin values assigned will come from the first person in that a value for race and/or origin. If only one value is obtained, the race (or only origin) are followed.  If only race is blank, the race value is assigned from the first person in that predetermined sequence with the same reported origin group. If only Hispanic origin is blank, the origin value is assigned from the first person in that sequence with the same reported race group. If race and/or origin cannot be assigned from anyone within the household, then a response is assigned from a ""hot deck."" (See the next section.) 3. ""Hot Deck"" Imputation Purpose: When race and Hispanic origin data are missing from all household records, an origin or race will be assigned from other Census records in surrounding blocks (or nearby households) with ""similar"" characteristics. A hot deck is a data table (or ""matrix"") in which values of reported responses (donors), stratified by selected characteristics of the respondents, are stored and updated on a flow basis and used as needed to assign values of the variable in question to people with similar characteristics who do not have a response. In the case of race, the assignment from the ""donor"" can be a single or multiple race. Each cell in this table is a ""stack"" of sixteen stored values that are constantly updated as each household is processed, with the most recently reported value being the first one available for use. Thus, if race cannot be assigned for an individual from within the household, a race is assigned from the first available value in the hot deck ""stack"" based on age and origin. This value will come from a ""donor"" with similar age and origin who will have a high likelihood of living nearby, perhaps even next door. Sixteen values are stored in each cell to guard against having to assign the same stored value over and over again if several people in a row with the same characteristics require a hot deck allocation. Tasks: In the race/Hispanic origin editing procedures, there are seven hot deck allocation matrices. Three of them are concerned with allocating both a race and an origin. All three matrices are stratified by three broad age groups (15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older) and focus solely on assigning race and origin to the householder. Use of these matrices occurs when no one in the household has either a reported race or a reported origin. The race and origin assigned to the householder will also be assigned to all other members of the household. Each matrix has a different universe of ""donors."" The universe for the first matrix will be donors with Spanish surnames (that is, only householders with Spanish surnames are used to update this matrix). The universe for the second matrix will be donors with non-Spanish surnames. The universe for the  5 For example, if only race is needed to be imputed for the child of the householder, the editing procedures would look in the household for the person with a race reported and with the same origin as the child. Records would be searched in the following priority sequence: householder, another child, and spouse of householder.  30   third matrix will be donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish, or who have not provided a surname on the census form. The remaining four hot deck matrices assign either race or origin. They are all stratified by four broad age groups (0-14, 15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older). The one matrix that assigns race alone is further stratified by seven origin groups (Not Hispanic and six Hispanic groups: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central American/Dominican, Latin/South American, and Other Hispanic). The three remaining matrices that assign origin alone are stratified by six race groups (White, Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and Some other race). The universes for the three origin hot deck matrices are, respectively: donors with a Spanish surname, donors with a non-Spanish surname, and donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. 4. Substitution Purpose: To assign characteristics for members of occupied housing units for which there is nothing but a count of people and there are no characteristics reported for anyone in the housing unit. Tasks: For housing units that are not vacant but for which there are no data, the Census Bureau uses a hot deck technique called ""substitution"" to assign characteristics (including race and origin) to the people in the housing unit. The assignment of characteristics is achieved through the use of a substitution hot deck matrix which contains ""cells"" of characteristics for reported households and is stratified according to the type of enumeration method used (mail out/mail back or enumerator) and the number of people in the household. These cells are updated using the characteristics of the most recently reported household of the specified enumeration method and size. As with the other hot deck matrices, each cell stores information for eight households and these cells are constantly being refreshed as new households enter the editing program and are eligible to update the matrix. 5. Group Quarters Editing Purpose: To assign characteristics to people in group quarters. Tasks: A separate editing procedure is used for the group quarters population. This editing procedure is necessarily different from the household editing procedure because, in general, people in group quarters are not related to each other and assigning values for members of households depends in some way on household relationships. For people who do not report an origin, the group quarters editing procedure first searches to see if an Hispanic origin can be obtained from a write-in response to the race question. If not, a group quarters hot deck matrix is used. Each hot deck matrix for assigning origin is stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and by race, using the same six race categories as those used in 31   the household hot decks. There are three hot deck matrices for origin: (a) one with donors having a Spanish surname, (b) one with donors having a non-Spanish surname, and (c) one with donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. If race is not reported, it will be assigned from the race group quarters hot deck matrix. The hot deck matrix is stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and by origin (non-Hispanic and six Hispanic groups). The seven origin groups are the same as those used in the household hot decks. If both origin and race are missing, they are assigned jointly from one of three race/origin group quarters hot decks: (a) one with donors having a Spanish surname, (b) one with donors having a non-Spanish surname, or (c) one with donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. These matrices are similar to the joint race/origin hot deck matrices used in the household editing and they are stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and age (0-14, 15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older).  32   Differences Between Census 2000 and 1990 Procedures for Editing Responses to the Questions on Race and Hispanic Origin Census 2000 RACE Reporting more than one race Reporting more than one race allowed Maximum of eight race codes retained.

Evaluating Census 2000 Data on Race For many census data users, both governmental and non-governmental and the private sector, there is a need to understand how the Census 2000 race distributions relate to race distributions from previous censuses and current surveys. Adoption of the 1997 standards resulted in a number of changes in the number and names of racial categories and in the sequencing of questions on ethnicity and race. For the 1990 census there were four racial categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander), whereas for Census 2000 there were five racial categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). In the 1990 census, the question on race preceded the question on Hispanic origin with two intervening questions. For Census 2000, the question on Hispanic origin was immediately before the question on race with a note to respondents to answer both questions. The most profound change to the standards, however, was that of allowing respondents to report more than one race if they chose to do so. Data by race from most Federal surveys currently reflect a collection methodology of asking respondents to mark only one racial category. Users of the Census 2000 data on race will need to compare the race distribution from Census 2000 to these other sources. To provide data users with a mechanism to make meaningful comparisons of data collected under the 1977 standards with data that are collected under the 1997 standards, the Census Bureau is undertaking two research projects. The first study was part of the Census 2000 data collection efforts. In Census 2000, an experimental panel of 10,000 housing units replicated the 1990 questions on race and Hispanic origin in the 1990 sequence and used the Census 2000 short form as a control panel. Data from the experimental and control panels will be used to evaluate the combined effects of the changes in question wording, format, content, and design on the quality and content of the data on race. The second study is currently being planned and is expected to be fielded in summer 2001. In this study, data from Census 2000 will be used to identify households where two or more races were reported for at least one respondent, using both short- and-long form households; differential sampling will be used to ensure that households receiving the long form are over sampled. Stratification and differential allocation of the sample to the strata will be explored to increase the precision of the estimates. Stratification will be based on Census 2000 data on such variables as age, Hispanic origin, race, tenure, and urban and rural geographic concentration. Other pertinent information obtained from an analysis of Census 2000 data on race and from external experts will also be considered in the sample design phase. A split panel design will be used; half of the sample households will be mailed a questionnaire that asks respondents to report a single race, while the other half will be asked to report one or more races. Much like in Census 2000, non-response follow up will be conducted for households that fail to return the questionnaire. To the extent possible, households that have moved since completing the Census 2000 questionnaires will be traced. Results from the respondents will be matched to their Census 2000 responses. Additionally, a follow-up interview will be conducted to ascertain relevant information to help understand the reporting behavior of respondents who reported two or more 34   races and are now being asked to report a single race or vice versa. Background information on single race respondents will also be obtained. It is expected that reliable estimates that replicate Census 2000 will be produced for the single race distribution and for the five most frequent combinations of two or more races (White and Black; White and American Indian and Alaska Native; White and Asian; Black and American Indian and Alaska Native; and Black and Asian) at the national level. Synthetic modeling is expected to produce reliable estimates at the state and lower geographic levels. Like the Census Bureau, other Federal agencies also have plans to evaluate data on race collected using the 1997 standards. Future updates of this guidance will include descriptions of these research projects and, if available, will summarize the research results.  35   CHAPTER 3 TABULATING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY COLLECTED USING THE 1997 STANDARDS This chapter describes plans for tabulating data on race and ethnicity collected under the 1997 standards to meet various Federal needs for these data. A. Census 2000 Data The Census 2000 questionnaire provided individuals the opportunity to self-report their racial identity by selecting one or more races. For purposes of Census 2000, in an effort to encourage response to this question and to provide the opportunity to gather data on extremely small groups, OMB approved the use of a sixth category -- Some Other Race -- in addition to the minimum set of five racial categories. This discussion covers tabulation plans for the six categories of race and the two categories of ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino) and for possible combinations of these racial and ethnic categories. It does not address tabulation plans that are being developed for detailed groups of American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic populations for which information was collected in Census 2000. 1. Protection of Data Confidentiality To maintain confidentiality as required by law (Title 13, United States Code), the Census Bureau uses a confidentiality edit to ensure that published data do not disclose information about specific individuals or households. The result is that a small amount of uncertainty is introduced into census data for small geographic areas to prevent identification of specific individuals or households. As with data from the 1990 census, a confidentiality edit will be implemented for data from Census 2000 by selecting a sample of census households from internal census files and interchanging their data with data from other households that have identical numbers of household members, but that are in different locations. The net result of this procedure is that the data user's ability to obtain census data is increased, particularly for small geographic areas and small population groups. 2. Plans for Tabulations by Race and Ethnicity The plans reflect OMB's preliminary guidelines (See Chapter 1, Section B) on tabulations by race and ethnicity. This discussion of the plans covers the presentation of data on both population totals for racial and ethnic categories and on population characteristics (e.g., age, sex, educational attainment, labor force status, occupation, and income) for racial and ethnic categories. 36   Before describing these plans for tabulations by race and ethnicity, it is helpful to describe the maximum number of racial and/or ethnic categories for which data could be provided. There are 63 potential single and multiple race categories -- 6 categories for those who marked exactly one race and 57 categories for those who marked two or more races. These 57 categories of two or more races include the 15 possible combinations of two races (for example, Asian and White), the 20 possible combinations of three races, the 15 possible combinations of four races, the 6 possible combinations of five races, and the 1 possible combination of all six races. There are two ethnic categories (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Thus there are 126 categories (63 x 2) in which the population could be classified by both race and ethnicity. The 63 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories of race may be collapsed down to 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories by combining the 57 categories of two or more races. These 7 categories are: White alone, Black or African American alone, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Asian alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, Some other race alone, and Two or more races. Alternative groupings for tabulations by race reflect OMB's preliminary guidelines to show ""the total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination."" In combination literally means ""in combination with one or more other races."" In this ""all-inclusive"" approach, tabulations will be shown for each of six categories, which will overlap and will add to more than the total population to the extent that individuals report more than one race. These six categories are: White alone or in combination, Black or African American alone or in combination, American Indian and Alaska Native alone or in combination, Asian alone or in combination, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone or in combination, and Some other race alone or in combination. As in the case of the 63 racial categories, both tabulations by race of the 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories and tabulations by race alone or in combination could be classified by ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Because of concerns about the usefulness and reliability of data on population characteristics for small populations, about issues with respect to confidentiality, and about providing data products so voluminous that most data cell values would be zero, the Census Bureau is planning (as it has in previous censuses) to present more geographic detail by race and ethnicity for population totals than for population characteristics (e.g., age, sex, housing tenure, education, and income). (The term population characteristics is used here to include both population and housing characteristics. The characteristics of occupied housing units by race and ethnicity are classified based on the race and ethnicity of the householder.) Specific plans concerning data on population totals and population characteristics by race and ethnicity are discussed later.  37   3. Overview of Plans for Data Products The Census Bureau plans to release a variety of data products from Census 2000 in three different media: Internet, CD-ROM, and paper. These data products will include 100-percent data (based on information collected on all questionnaires, such as age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin) and sample data (based on information collected only on long-form questionnaires, such as education, occupation, and income). Population totals by race and ethnicity are based on 100percent data, whereas some population characteristics by race and ethnicity are based on 100percent and some on sample data. The presentation of data by race and ethnicity planned for eight different aggregated data products and for microdata files is discussed below in detail. The eight aggregated data products are: (1) Census 2000 Redistricting Data Summary File (100-percent data) (2) Demographic Profile (100-percent and sample data on population characteristics for the total population, but no characteristics data by race or ethnicity) (3) Summary File 1 (100-percent data) (4) Summary File 2 (100-percent data) (5) Quick Tables (100-percent data and sample data) (6) Census 2000: Summary Population and Housing Characteristics (100-percent data) (7) Summary File 3 (sample data) (8) Summary File 4 (sample data) Plans for aggregated tabulations by race and ethnicity are discussed in the following two sections, first for 100-percent data on population totals and characteristics and then for sample data on population characteristics. Microdata files are discussed in the last section. 4. 100-Percent Data on Population Totals and Characteristics by Race and Ethnicity Census 2000 Redistricting Data Summary File (100-percent data). This file is referred to hereafter as the PL 94-171 file, by which name it is commonly known. Public Law 94-171 requires that the Census Bureau work closely with the ""officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting of each state"" to determine the specific tabulations needed from the decennial census. Tabulations planned for this file are based on meetings and communications with the Redistricting Task Force of the National Conference of State Legislatures and state-appointed liaisons of the governors and legislatures. During this process, senior officials from OMB, the Voting Rights Section of the Department of Justice, and the Census Bureau consulted with the Task Force and state legislative officials. As described earlier, a confidentiality edit will be used in Census 2000, as was done in the 1990 census. Thus, as in 1990, there will be no data suppression, and there will be many data cells in the PL 94-171 file with very small values (e.g., zero, one, or two). The PL 94-171 file will include population totals down to the block level for the 63 racial categories described earlier, along with subtotals for the population of one race, for two or more 38   races, and for each combination of two races, three races, four races, five races, and six races. The PL 94-171 file will include four matrices (one-dimensional statistical tables). The first matrix will show the racial categories just described. The second matrix will show the total Hispanic or Latino population and the racial categories for the population that is Not Hispanic or Latino. The racial and ethnic categories included in these two matrices are shown in Table 1. The third and fourth matrices will repeat the first and second matrices, but limited to the population 18 years and older. From the data that will be presented on the PL 94-171 File, it will be possible to derive population totals for a race alone or in combination (by addition) and for the Hispanic or Latino population by race (by subtraction). The PL 94-171 file will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Demographic Profile (100-percent data). For geographic areas down to the census tract level, the Demographic Profile is designed to provide an overview of 100-percent census data that includes all population and housing topics for which data were collected on a 100-percent basis: sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household relationship, and housing occupancy and tenure. Given the limited amount of space to show data on each topic, population totals by race and ethnicity will be limited, and data on population characteristics will be limited to the total population. Population totals will be shown for each of the six races alone, for two or more races, and for each major race alone or in combination (as described earlier), but will not be shown for the 57 specific categories of two or more races. The population total will be shown also for the Hispanic or Latino population. The Demographic Profile will be available on the Internet and CD-ROM and will be available also on paper for governmental units (including states, counties, incorporated places, American Indian and Alaska Native Areas, and Hawaiian Home Lands). Summary File 1 (100-percent data). For population totals, data shown down to the block level on the PL 94-171 File (including all 63 racial categories) will be repeated on Summary File 1 (SF-1). Data on population characteristics will be shown on SF-1 for the total population and for nine racial or ethnic groups. In some cases characteristics will be shown down to the block level and in other cases down to the census tract level. The ten groups for which population characteristics will be shown are: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) Total White alone Black or African American alone American Indian and Alaska Native alone Asian alone Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone Some other race alone Two or more races 39   (9) Hispanic or Latino (of any race) (10) White alone, not Hispanic or Latino SF-1 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Summary File 2 (100-percent data). Summary File 2 (SF-2) will show data on population characteristics, subject to a population threshold, down to the census tract level for a large number of groups. As shown in Table 2, these groups include the 63 racial categories, two or more races, the six races alone or in combination, Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino for race alone and for race alone or in combination. The population threshold for SF-2 is 100. If the population of a racial or ethnic group is less than 100 in a geographic area (e.g., a county or a census tract), population characteristics for that group for that geographic area will not be included on SF-2. (Even if population characteristics for a specific group in a specific geographic area are not available on SF-2, the population total will be available on SF-1.) SF-2 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Quick Tables (100-percent data). Quick Tables (referred to as Table Shells in the Draft Provisional Guidance of 2/17/99) represent a new data product for Census 2000. Each Quick Table is designed to print on one page (from the Internet) and has a fixed table boxhead and table stub (e.g., showing population by age and sex). The Quick Tables, which correspond generally to tables in detailed printed report series from the 1990 census, are supported by the summary files (just as summary tape files supported detailed printed report series in 1990). Quick tables show less data than are available in summary files, but in a more user-friendly format, including more derived measures such as percent distributions. Quick Tables will be available down to the census tract level and will show extensive 100-percent data by race and ethnicity, subject to a population threshold of 100, including population characteristics for racial and ethnic groups included in SF-1 and SF-2. Quick tables will be available on the Internet. Census 2000 Summary Population and Housing Characteristics (100-percent data). This is a printed report series (one report per state and a national summary report) that is designed to provide an overview of 100-percent data in a format that facilitates comparison across geographic areas (e.g., all counties in a state). As with the Demographic Profile, some population totals will be presented by race and ethnicity, as shown in Table 3, but data on population characteristics will be limited to the total population with the following two exceptions. Data on population characteristics will be shown for the American Indian and Alaska Native population in American Indian and Alaska Native Areas and for the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander population in Hawaiian Home Lands. This printed report series, which corresponds closely to the 1990 census printed report series on Summary Population and Housing Characteristics, will show data in state reports for counties, county subdivisions, and places (both incorporated and unincorporated).  40   Census 2000 Summary Population and Housing Characteristics will be a printed report series. 5. Sample Data on Population Characteristics by Race and Ethnicity Summary File 3 (sample data). Sample data (based on information collected only on long-form questionnaires, such as education, occupation, and income) on population characteristics down to the block group level will be provided on Summary File 3 (SF-3). These data will be shown for the total population and for the same nine racial and ethnic groups for which data on 100-percent population characteristics will be shown on SF-1. The data on SF-3 will be shown subject to a population threshold (see earlier discussion of SF-2); however, this threshold has not yet been determined. SF-3 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Summary File 4 (sample data). Sample data on population characteristics down to the census tract level will be provided on Summary File 4 (SF-4). These data will be shown for the same list of racial and ethnic groups for which data on 100-percent population characteristics will be shown on SF-2. The data on SF-4 will be shown subject to a population threshold (see earlier discussion of SF-2); however, this threshold has not yet been determined. SF-4 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Quick Tables (sample data). The earlier description of Quick Tables in conjunction with 100percent data applies also to sample data. Quick Tables will be available down to the census tract level and will show extensive sample data by race and ethnicity, including population characteristics for racial and ethnic groups included in SF-3 and SF-4. The population threshold for sample Quick Tables will depend on the threshold selected for SF-3 and SF-4. Quick Tables will be available on the Internet. 6. Microdata Files Tabulations on population characteristics by race and ethnicity described above are limited to what is planned for aggregated data products. In addition, the Census Bureau will produce public-use microdata sample (PUMS) files, as was done in 1990, which will include data by race and ethnicity. Plans for PUMs files from Census 2000, including the amount of racial and ethnic detail, are currently being developed. In 1990, in addition to the confidentiality edit described earlier, the PUMS files were stripped of names and addresses, the order of records was rearranged on the file, and a minimum population threshold of 100,000 was used. In addition, and subject to the Census Bureau's strict confidentiality standards, the Census Bureau plans to make available on the Internet through the American FactFinder, an Advanced Query Function that permits data users to create tabulations to their own specifications based on  41   microdata files. These microdata files, which underlie the 100-percent and sample summary files, are the 100-percent edited detail file (HEDF) and the sample edited detail file (SEDF). If a data user wants data on population characteristics for a racial or ethnic group for which characteristics are not available in summary files or Quick Tables and for a geographic area for which a PUMS file is not available, it will be possible -- again, subject to strict confidentiality standards set by the Census Bureau -- to obtain these data with a custom tabulation from the Census Bureau. Because of the strict confidentiality standards, the quantity of data that can be obtained will depend on several factors, including the geographic area, the size of the population universe, and the extent of the characteristics' detail.  42   Table 3.1.

Survey and Administrative Records Data This section applies to the presentation of data collected under the 1997 standards through surveys and administrative records. Although these proposed tabulation guidelines are applicable in the near term, they are designed to provide a framework that can be expanded in the future as it becomes possible to present more data on multiple race responses. The main guideline is that data should be presented in as much detail as possible (thereby satisfying the congruence with respondent's choice criterion), subject to agency criteria for statistical reliability and confidentiality (satisfying the meet confidentiality and reliability standards criterion), and thus the amount of detail presented will be a function of sample size and sample design. In addition, to the extent possible, Federal agencies should report data using the same set of standardized categories to facilitate comparisons across subject-matter areas and data systems, thus satisfying the criteria relating to range of applicability, statistical defensibility, and understandability and communicability. The decision to revise the policy for the collection of data on race reflects the increasing complexity of our Nation's demographics. As a result, the ways that survey and administrative record data on race are tabulated and analyzed also will become more complex. The proposed guidelines in this section reflect this complexity. Every attempt was made to keep the tables as simple as possible in order to satisfy the criteria ease of use and skill required. Examples of tabulation strategies are provided and illustrated using data collected as part of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to report more than one race, but has also asked respondents to indicate the single race with which they most closely identified. The data on race from this survey have been retabulated for illustrative purposes to be as comparable as possible to the categories in the 1997 standards. (The tables in this section are based on data combined from three years of NHIS data. The resulting larger sample size improves the reliability of the estimates and enables more categories to be shown; however, even when combining three years of data on race, counts for some categories cannot be shown due to small sample sizes. In addition, in some tables, cell counts are divided by a constant to illustrate the situation faced by surveys with smaller sample sizes than the NHIS and/or where it is not possible or appropriate to combine more than one year of data.) As noted above, agencies are to provide as much detail as possible while adhering to their own standards for data quality and confidentiality. Under a typical data quality standard, a table cell cannot be published if its relative standard error (or other measure of dispersion) is larger than some value specified by the agency. Such a cell would be suppressed (withheld from publication). Under a confidentiality standard, a cell value must be suppressed if knowledge of the cell value might enable someone to gain knowledge about one of the respondents contributing data to the cell. If a cell is suppressed to preserve confidentiality, other cells must also be suppressed so the cell value cannot be derived by subtraction. This is called ""complementary suppression."" In either situation, information on subgroups that cannot appear separately in the table would be included in appropriate subtotals and/or in the total. (The reader may wish to 48   refer to Statistical Policy Working Paper 22: Report on Statistical Disclosure Limitation Methodology for more information concerning the definition of sensitive cells and the selection of cells for complementary suppression. The Statistical Policy Working Papers are available on the Internet at www.fedstats.gov -- go to Policy.) Since agencies do not use a common set of standards for evaluating confidentiality and quality issues, arbitrary cell size criteria were adopted in this report to illustrate how the application of agency quality and confidentiality standards might affect the cells that can be shown in tables. No data for cells of less than 150 are shown in any table. The tables that result give a preview of the distributions that are likely to result from the implementation of the 1997 standards. Note that since the only data being displayed in this report are population counts, it is possible to show more data cells using the 150 criterion than would be the case if the table presented attributes (income, education, health outcomes, etc.) of these groups. In addition, counts are provided for all ages and both sexes. If data are presented for one sex or one age group, as is most often the case, cell sizes would be much smaller and not as many cells could be reported. Individual survey systems will make decisions as to what data can be shown based on the characteristics of each system and the confidentiality and reliability guidelines established for that data system. It will not be possible to tabulate two types of responses into the categories identified in the standards. The first type of response is when no information on race is provided. In this report the heading ""Race Not Reported"" is used for this type of response. This response type can be further subdivided according to the reason that no information was obtained -- refusal, don't know, and not ascertained. The second type is when the response that was received does not match any of the standard racial categories. Such responses are tabulated in this report using the heading ""Other Race."" Given that sample size will determine what categories can be shown in a given table, a third heading, ""Not Tabulated Above,"" will be used to include either single or ""more than one race"" categories that are specified in the standard, but that are not large enough to be published separately. Unknowns are included in this category as well. These three special headings (""Race Not Reported,"" ""Other Race,"" and ""Not Tabulated Above"") are used in the tables in this section for illustrative purposes. Since these categories are generally of more interest for methodological rather than substantive analyses, most statistical publications will probably use simpler ways of accounting for these types of responses. Strategies for tabulating these kinds of responses will follow agency policy and the analytic objectives of the report. A remaining issue to be addressed by Federal agencies is the manner in which data are edited and imputed. The rules used to edit and impute respondents' data on race and ethnicity will affect the racial distributions derived from Federal surveys and administrative records. As noted elsewhere in this report, rules for editing and imputation of data on race and ethnicity should be an area of further research and collaboration for Federal agencies, to ensure that the data reported are as comparable as possible.  49   Since the objective of this section is to illustrate different tabulation strategies, categories with frequencies too small to be shown will not be treated the same way in all of the tables. In some tables, the category is not shown at all in the table stub but the cell value is included in the total and might be included under the heading ""Not Tabulated Above"" (as described above). In other tables, the category is retained in order to clarify the structure of the table but data are replaced by a ""W"" to illustrate that they have been withheld from publication for data quality/confidentiality considerations. When the data are replaced by ""W,"" a footnote is used to describe the reason the data are not shown. No guidance is suggested for handling categories too small to be shown in the table. Such decisions will follow agency guidelines and the objectives of the analyses. In all tables in this section, the ""More Than One Race"" heading includes respondents who selected more than one of the five basic racial categories in the 1997 standards. Following recommendations in the standards, many data collection systems obtain information on a more detailed set of responses. When surveys collect more detailed information on race than the minimum five racial categories, some persons may indicate that they identify with more than one of the more detailed groups. For example, within the Asian group, respondents might indicate that they are of Chinese and Japanese heritage. These respondents would not be included in the ""More Than One Race"" heading, but would be included in the total for Asians. In tables where specific Asian heritages are reported, and if sample sizes are sufficient, an additional Asian subcategory could be used to indicate the number of individuals who marked more than one of the detailed Asian categories. Table 3.4 provides a detailed set of categories for tabulating data on race that reflects the major dimensions of the 1997 standards. Table 3.4 displays the five single categories, includes more detail on the Asian subgroups, and displays a number of multiple-response categories. The specific multiple response categories that could be presented in other data collection systems would be a function of the overall sample size and the regional characteristics of the population where the sample is selected. The detailed subcategories that are presented should support recreating the minimum basic set of racial categories (American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN); Asian; Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI); and White). To illustrate the construction of a table based on a survey with a smaller sample size, all cell counts have been divided by 20. Table 3.5 shows a category for each of the five single racial groups in the 1997 standards as well as a ""More Than One Race"" heading; sample sizes do not permit the presentation of more detailed categories, including single race AIAN and NHOPI and specific multiple race categories. Data are not shown separately for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, the single race category with the smallest frequency, nor for any of the subcategories under ""More Than One Race."" The category ""Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders"" is retained in the table stub and a ""W"" in the cell indicates that the value is withheld due to sample size. Since the Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander category is the only single race category that cannot be shown, both the number and the percent for the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander group are readily obtained by subtraction. This would be appropriate only if the cell were being suppressed for data quality concerns (i.e., the value is 50   unreliable). If it were being suppressed for confidentiality concerns, another cell would also have to be suppressed to prevent the cell value from being obtained by subtraction. As was the case under the 1977 standards, it will often not be possible to tabulate data using all of the categories used to collect the information. If data for one or more of the five minimum racial categories fail the requirements for data quality or confidentiality, standard agency products should include them in an aggregation such as ""Not Tabulated Above,"" or only in the totals rather than combining them with categories that are publishable alone. For example, if the data for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders cannot be published separately, these data should not be combined with data in the Asian category (except when such combinations are needed for comparability with data collected under the 1977 standards). Instead, the data on Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders should be included in the total and either omitted from the detailed tabulations completely, replaced with a symbol and footnoted, or included in a separate heading for all groups not specifically tabulated (i.e., under the ""Not Tabulated Above"" heading.) This last approach is illustrated in Table 3.6 from Table 3.4 where cell counts have been divided by 60. This table is designed to illustrate what might happen when sample sizes are increasingly smaller and data from even fewer categories can be reliably presented. The American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, ""More Than One Race,"" and ""Race Not Reported"" categories are not listed separately in Table 3.6, but were included both in the Total and the ""Not Tabulated Above"" rows. In order to display as much data as possible, as well as to reflect the complexity of reporting on race, some additional categories may be tabulated and reported along with the basic tabulations. These categories may not be mutually exclusive but would combine categories to create useful analytic distinctions. For example, a heading could be created for persons reporting that they are Asian whether as a single race or in combination with any other race(s). Parallel categories could be created for any of the five single racial categories. The resulting counts are called ""all inclusive."" They form distributions for each individual racial group; that is, the sum of the percent of respondents who mark a particular group alone, the percent who mark that group and at least one other group, and the percent who did not mark that group is 100 percent. The all inclusive distributions may provide information on population groups that might not have sufficient size in the sample to be included in basic tabulations. Table 3.7 provides a suggested tabulation strategy. The ""NHOPI in combination with other races"" category does not meet the criteria for inclusion (n=150) and, therefore, is not shown. If this cell suppression were intended to preserve confidentiality, another cell would have to suppressed as well. This is illustrated by suppressing the ""NHOPI all inclusive"" category. Note that when the tabulation involves counts or percentages, the analyst can subtract the count or percentage for each single race from the all inclusive count or percentage to obtain the count of individuals reporting each race in combination with any other race(s). For example, the ""Black or African American all inclusive count"" minus the ""Black or African American"" single race count will yield a count for those reporting ""Black or African American in combination with one or more other races."" This would not be possible if the tabulation included summary statistics (mean, median, or percent) for attributes such as income, education, or health outcomes. 51   Tables 3.4 - 3.7 describe tabulation alternatives for data on race collected using the 1997 standards. These standards also affect the collection and reporting of data on Hispanic or Latino origin. The 1997 standards call for asking a question on Hispanic or Latino origin followed by a question on race but also allows under limited circumstances for a single, combined question where Hispanic or Latino origin is included in a list along with the five standard racial categories. In such a combined question, respondents are also instructed to ""mark one or more."" In either approach, Hispanic origin may be reported alone or in combination with one or more races. As was the case for the tabulation of data on race, data on Hispanic or Latino ethnicity can also be presented for specific subgroups (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican) as shown in Table 3.8. The tabulation headings used will be a function of the overall sample size and the population composition where the sample is selected. Table 3.8 presents data only on Hispanic ethnicity and does not include information on race. Whether separate questions or a combined format is used to collect data on Hispanic or Latino origin and race, there are applications where a combined tabulation of the data on these two dimensions is preferred. Data collected under the 1997 standards using either format will support the analysis of data on both Hispanics or Latinos and non-Hispanics or non-Latinos by race (Table 3.9). For example, Table 3.9 shows that among Hispanics or Latinos, the sample size permits the presentation of data for Blacks, Whites, those of ""other"" races, and those selecting more than one race. Tabulations which incorporate the Hispanic or Latino subgroup information can be developed by expanding Table 3.9. Since respondents are free to select one or more categories in the combined format, data collected from a survey or administrative reporting system where a combined format is used can also be tabulated using Tables 3.8 or 3.9.  52   Table 3.4.

A. Civil Rights Enforcement and Monitoring OMB Bulletin No. 00-02. In response to requests from agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws, OMB led an interagency group that developed guidance on:   the collection of aggregate data on race when agencies request information from businesses, schools, and other entities and the allocation by agencies of multiple race responses, whether individual or aggregate, for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement.  This guidance (issued as OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, dated March 9, 2000 -- see Appendix B) ensures that agencies can continue to monitor compliance with laws that offer protections for those who historically have experienced discrimination and that reporting burdens are minimized for those reporting aggregate data on race to Federal agencies. The 1997 standards require, among other things, that agencies offer individuals the opportunity to select one or more races when reporting information on race in Federal data collections. Federal enforcement agencies often collect data on race from businesses, schools, and other entities in aggregate form. To meet these reporting requirements, these institutions will now be collecting single and multiple race responses from individuals and aggregating them for Federal reports. To simplify and minimize the reporting burden for institutions, an aggregation method has been developed that uses:     the five single race categories; four double race combinations most frequently reported in recent studies; any multiple race combinations based on Census 2000 data that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest in the relevant jurisdictions; and a balance category to report those individual responses that are not included in (1) one of the five single race categories or four double race combinations or (2) other combinations that represent more than one percent of the population in a jurisdiction.  60   This method provides consistency across agencies for the reporting of aggregate data, but does not preclude the collection of more detailed information if the agency chooses to do so. The following example illustrates this aggregation method. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American > 1 percent: Fill in if applicable______________________ > 1 percent: Fill in if applicable______________________ Balance of individuals reporting more than one race Total  To provide consistency across agencies responsible for enforcing civil rights laws, guidance has been developed for how multiple race responses should be allocated. This allocation guidance does not use methods that require either fractional or double counting of individuals, or arbitrary allocation of responses to one minority group versus another. The following rules will be used to allocate multiple race responses for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement.    Responses in the five single race categories are not allocated. Responses that combine one minority race and white are allocated to the minority race. Responses that include two or more minority races are allocated as follows:  If the enforcement action is in response to a complaint, allocate to the race that the complainant alleges the discrimination was based on.  61     If the enforcement action requires assessing disparate impact or discriminatory patterns, analyze the patterns based on alternative allocations to each of the minority groups.  Allocation for enforcement purposes should not be confused with various allocation methods for ""bridging"" to past data collections as discussed in Chapter 5 of this report. The principal purpose of allocation for bridging purposes is to conduct trend or time series analysis. 1. Redistricting One of the first official statutory uses of data on race and ethnicity collected under the new standards will be for legislative redistricting following Census 2000. The new data format should not require substantial changes in the way redistricting will be conducted. a. Background Before a new redistricting plan can legally be implemented, states and political subdivisions that are covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act (which include all state and local jurisdictions in nine states and parts of seven others) are required to demonstrate to either the United States Attorney General or a Federal district court in the District of Columbia that their new redistricting plan has neither the purpose nor the effect of reducing the voting strength of their minority citizens. In addition, all states and political subdivisions are prohibited by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act from using redistricting plans that have the purpose or effect of discriminating against minority voters, including diluting their voting strength. The U.S. Department of Justice or private citizens may file lawsuits to enforce Section 2. In order to comply with these Federal laws, states and their political subdivisions typically use the Bureau of Census redistricting count tabulations issued pursuant to Public Law 94-171 to assess the racial and ethnic compositions and distributions of their residents as they draw their redistricting plans. The data are also central to the Department's analysis of whether or not a new redistricting plan reduces the voting strength of minority citizens in violation of Section 5 of the Act. The data are also used for evaluating and proving claims under Section 2 of the Act. For example, the data are used to determine where minority voters are concentrated, as well as to identify areas of racially polarized voting. After the redistricting process is complete, courts rely on the redistricting count data, together with other evidence, to decide any Section 2 legal challenge that may be filed challenging the redistricting plan. b. How the 2000 Census Data Will Be Used for Redistricting in 2001 The 1990 census Public Law 94-171 tabulations reported data down to the block level for the total population and the voting age population (ages 18 years and older) for four racial groups (American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and White) and a residual category (""other"" race). Data on these racial groups were also cross-tabulated by  62   Hispanic origin. Categories were mutually exclusive (each person was counted only once), and the categories added to the total population reported for a geographic region. In Census 2000, there are three major changes to the reporting of data on race and ethnicity: (1) the instruction to ""mark one or more"" racial categories; (2) the splitting of the ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" category into two separate categories -- ""Asian"" and ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;"" and (3) the combining of the 1990 categories for American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut into a single ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" category with a write-in space (as in 1990) for principal or enrolled tribe. Hispanic or Latino origin was ascertained in a separate question, as in the 1990 census. The Census 2000 PL 94-171 Redistricting Data will, for the first time, include tabulations of persons who marked two or more races (the multiple race tabulations). In tabulating the PL 94-171 data, the Bureau of the Census will produce 63 tabulation categories: 6 tabulation categories for the 5 ""single race"" groups plus ""some other race""; and 57 tabulation categories for possible combinations of these 6 groups. Such data will be reported in full detail down to the block level to provide the flexibility needed for the enforcement of civil rights programs, and particularly for analysis of redistricting plans under the Voting Rights Act. In accordance with Title 13, U.S. Code, the Census Bureau will continue to protect the confidentiality of individuals during the tabulation and presentation of the Voting Rights data at every step in the process and during the course of Census 2000. The inclusion of multiple race tabulations in the PL 94-171 redistricting data file has raised questions as to how such data will be analyzed by the Department of Justice pursuant to its responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act. This issue has been addressed in OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, issued on March 9, 2000 (see Appendix B). In its analysis of the Census redistricting data, the Department of Justice will be guided by the bulletin. After aggregating the data pursuant to Part I of the bulletin, multiple race responses will be allocated pursuant to Part II of the bulletin. Thus, any responses that indicate white and one minority race will be allocated to the minority race. Multiple race responses that include more than one minority race will be reviewed to determine if there are any patterns affecting any of the minority races reported. Current research indicates that the number of multiple race responses in the Census 2000 is expected to be small  2 percent or less. Therefore, the impact of multiple race responses on the analysis of Census data for purposes of the Department of Justice's responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act is likely to be minimal.

Equal Employment Opportunity This section describes the process for implementing the 1997 standards in data collections that are used for monitoring equal employment opportunities. One of the Federal Government's most significant uses of data on race and ethnicity is in its efforts to ensure that every individual has an equal opportunity for employment. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination in employment based upon race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or retaliation/reprisal. Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, similarly prohibits discrimination in employment by Federal Government contractors. Executive Order No. 11246 also requires contractors covered by its provisions to ensure affirmatively that they do not discriminate against their employees and applicants for employment. Responsibility for enforcement of Federal equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws and regulations is shared among the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the U.S. Department of Education. The Federal EEO agencies use data on race and ethnicity to ensure nondiscrimination in employment. In implementing the 1997 standards, the EEO agencies will consider the burden imposed on those required to collect and report racial and ethnic data to the Federal Government. The 1997 standards are not intended to diminish the availability and quality of information collected and made available for civil rights enforcement purposes. Following the 1990 census, the Census Bureau, under contract to EEO agencies, created an EEO Special File that has been generally used as a benchmark for employment availability determinations. It is anticipated that a similar file containing data collected under the 1997 standards will be created from the Census 2000 data. a. Employee and Applicant Reporting Requirements  Methods Used Prior to Implementing the 1997 Standards Data on each private employer's workforce are collected annually on the Employer Information Reports (EEO-1 Report). Biennial surveys are collected from local referral unions (EEO-3), state and local governments (EEO-4), elementary and secondary public schools (EEO-5), and postsecondary schools using the Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS Fall Staff Survey, formerly EEO-6). Currently, these forms collect information about each employer's workforce by job category, gender, and race/ethnicity using the categories in the 1977 standards. Under the 1977 standards, employers were only required to collect, maintain, and report single race information on employees, using the following five categories: (1) White, not of Hispanic origin; (2) Black, not of Hispanic origin; (3) Hispanic; (4) Asian or Pacific Islander; and (5) 64   American Indian or Alaskan Native. Instructions on the current EEO forms state that the race/ethnicity of an employer's workforce may be obtained either by ""visual surveys of the workforce, or from post-employment records."" The current instructions explicitly state that eliciting information from employees via direct inquiry is not encouraged. The OFCCP is developing an Equal Opportunity Survey (EO Survey) to obtain employment information from selected Federal contractor establishments. The EO Survey will collect information about applicant and employee personnel activity, and employee compensation, by gender, race, and ethnicity, sorted by EEO-1 job categories. The survey requests that each applicant or employee be identified by gender, by Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin, and by one of the five racial categories. Contractors responding to the EO Survey have discretion to use the 1977 racial/ethnic categories if they have not yet converted their record keeping to the 1997 standards. Educational institutions, however, should follow the guidelines set forth in Section 3 on Equal Access to Education for reporting data on their employees. For reporting covering 2000 through 2002, employers (including contractors) and unions subject to these reporting requirements will continue to submit EEO-1, EEO-3, EEO-4, EEO-5, OFCCP EO Survey, and IPEDS Fall Staff Survey, in their respective current formats. Employers will use the new forms that reflect the 1997 standards starting in 2003 to provide data on the work force for the 2003 calendar year. b. Required Changes to EEO Forms and Instructions to Implement the 1997 Standards To be consistent with the 1997 standards, certain changes are planned for EEO reporting forms and instructions. These changes (along with updates to reflect changes in the industry and occupational classifications) will be submitted as usual under the Paperwork Reduction Act for OMB approval, allowing sufficient time so that non-Federal employers may prepare for their use starting in 2003. Data collections covering Federal employment will also be updated by OPM and EEOC to reflect the 1997 standards. OPM is engaged in ongoing discussions with numerous Federal agencies to develop a standardized approach for collecting and reporting data under the 1997 standards. The following changes are planned for the reporting forms and instructions: -- The ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"" racial category will be added. -- ""Asian"" will replace the category ""Asian or Pacific Islander."" -- The following changes in terminology will be made: -- ""Alaska Native"" will replace the term ""Alaskan Native."" -- ""Black or African American"" will replace the term ""Black."" -- ""Hispanic or Latino"" will replace the term ""Hispanic.""  65   -- Data on Hispanic or Latino ethnicity will be collected in a separate question for each occupational group. c. EEO Approach to Data Collection and Record Keeping Requirements Under the 1997 Standards Federal EEO agencies use a variety of reporting forms to collect data from businesses, schools, and other establishments. These forms are subject to review and approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act. In redesigning EEO forms to comply with the 1997 standards, the following categories for race will be recommended for EEO data collection and record keeping: American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of individuals reporting more than one race The balance category will be used to report individual responses that are not included in any of the single race categories or in any of the two-race categories listed above. When Census 2000 data become available, the EEO agencies will undertake an analysis of the distribution of two-race combinations. This analysis will be undertaken, first, to confirm the four most common multiple race combinations found at the national level. If they are different from the four previously mentioned, the EEO proposed forms will be changed accordingly. Second, this analysis will be used to determine whether there are any additional multiple race combinations that should reported in the EEO proposed forms. In addition, the following changes in EEO data collections are being made as part of the implementation of the 1997 standards:    Self-identification will be the preferred method of collecting data on race and ethnicity in the employment setting. Individuals will be permitted to report one or more races on applications and other forms pertaining to their employment. A two-question format will be used to obtain information on the ethnicity and race of each applicant or employee. The ethnicity question (Hispanic or Latino or Not Hispanic or Latino) will be asked first, followed by the race question. 66     If an applicant or employee declines to self-report, employers may then determine the information on race and ethnicity required for reporting purposes by visual observation or from post-employment records.  d. Ensuring Common Approaches in EEO Enforcement As set forth by OMB in Bulletin No. 00-02 (see Appendix B), the following principles apply regarding data on race in enforcing employment discrimination laws and regulations:    Individuals who select only one racial category will be counted in that category. Individuals who select one minority race and White will be counted as part of that minority race. For the purpose of analyzing an enforcement action, responses of individuals who select more than one minority race will be allocated to the race involved in the enforcement action, if that race is among the ones they have selected. For example, where an enforcement action is based on complaints of discrimination on the basis of Black or African American, responses from individuals reporting themselves as Black or African American and American Indian or Alaska Native will be allocated into the Black or African American category for the purpose of analyzing the enforcement action. For nonenforcement-related analyses covering internal and external workforce distributions, several implementation issues remain unresolved at this time. For example, questions covering increased employer record keeping burdens under alternative allocation approaches must be examined further. Additionally, where the enforcement involves Federal litigation, questions remain to be resolved regarding judicial interpretation of both analytical methodology and admissible evidence standards that cover private and Federal lawsuits.    e. Resurveying the Workforce In converting to a new EEO-1 form in 2003 that reflects 1997 standards, employers will have to reconcile the 1997 standards with the pre-1997 standards under which employee race and ethnicity will be reported through 2002. In issuing the 1997 standards, OMB did not indicate that employers, in implementing the new standards, would be required to resurvey incumbent employees whose race/ethnicity was originally classified under the pre-1997 standards. Each EEO agency will determine if resurveying should be required as part of its enforcement activity. Employers who report to more than one Federal agency, one of which requires resurveying, will be required to resurvey irrespective of whether the other Federal agencies impose the same requirement. After a careful review of the pros and cons associated with resurveying, EEOC may require resurveying as part of its record keeping and reporting 67   requirement. EEOC seeks to ensure that the race and ethnicity reported by employees hired under the old standards prior to 2003, and by employees hired under the 1997 standard beginning with reports filed in 2003, will be consistent and comparable. EEOC is concerned that, unless resurveying is conducted, the racial identity of employees previously reported as Hispanic would be unknown. Complete racial and ethnic comparisons are needed to ensure data continuity and comparability, and to promote accuracy in enforcing EEO laws and regulations. 3. Equal Access to Education Another significant use of race and ethnicity data occurs in the context of the Federal Government's efforts to ensure that every individual has an equal opportunity for education and to collect and analyze data on the educational experience in America. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division are responsible for enforcement of the statutes that protect equal opportunity in education regardless of race, color, sex, national origin, age, or disability pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. OCR also monitors whether a recipient of Federal financial assistance has utilized criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The Department of Justice also enforces Title IV and Title VI, as well as the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, and also may intervene in private suits that allege violations of education related anti-discrimination statutes and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the National Center for Education Statistics is authorized to collect, analyze, and disseminate statistics on race and other population characteristics when such information would facilitate educational policy and decision making. a. Data Collection and Record Keeping Requirements Under the 1997 Standards On March 9, 2000, OMB issued Bulletin No. 00-02 (see Appendix B) providing guidance for Federal enforcement agencies in their use of data on race for civil rights monitoring and enforcement. The guidance indicates that for this purpose Federal agencies should aggregate data into the five single race categories, the four most frequently reported multiple race combinations, and any multiple race combinations that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest. b. Racial and Ethnic Data in Educational Institutions Data on the race and ethnicity of students are critical to many sound educational practices and to monitoring and enforcing civil rights in educational institutions. The elimination of discrimination in educational institutions ensures that all individuals have equal access to educational opportunities. Although Federal enforcement agencies do not determine civil rights compliance based on numbers alone, analyzing student populations by race and other important factors can identify potential issues or problems. This information also enables schools to take proactive steps to prevent potential civil rights violations. Furthermore, assessing the performance of districts, schools, and students by examining information on race and ethnicity 68   can serve important educational goals. Such assessments can allow schools to identify where new approaches or programs are needed and whether existing programs are serving the needs of all students. The Department of Education has received information from individual schools and states as well as anecdotal reports in the media that suggest that asking children to self-report their race may lead to higher multiple race reports when compared to adult self-reports. Some information indicates that this rate could be substantially higher, particularly in certain jurisdictions. For example, one state has informed Federal officials that 16 percent of its school age population would identify itself as more than one race (in contrast to the estimated 2 percent of the overall nationwide population). In this state, there is also evidence which suggests that some of these students are inconsistent in identifying their race and ethnicity; that is, they change their answers to race and ethnicity questions depending on the situation and/or over time. Moreover, there is research evidence that as children with multiple racial heritages age, they tend to identify with one race in somewhat larger numbers than when they were younger. Federal enforcement agencies must balance the interest in obtaining complete, detailed data to facilitate effective monitoring of the civil rights laws with the need to minimize the cost and burden on schools and colleges of collecting and reporting information. The collection and reporting of all possible combinations of race and ethnic categories would create an excessive burden for many, if not most, institutions. Further, such an excessive burden could dramatically slow the receipt of information on educational institutions and thereby delay the enforcement process. The Federal Government recognizes these potential burdens. Bulletin No. 00-02 states that ""we must minimize reporting burden for institutions such as schools and businesses that report aggregate data on race to Federal agencies."" The Bulletin also notes, however, that ""[a]s the revised standards for collecting and presenting data are implemented, we must ensure that we maintain our ability to monitor compliance with laws that offer protections for those who historically have experienced discrimination."" The Department of Education recognizes that educational institutions need to maintain consistency between changes affecting data on students and changes affecting data on staff and faculty. The Department of Education has elected to wait until after Census 2000 data are available to determine how educational institutions should aggregate racial and ethnic data for their students and employees under the 1997 standards. Based on these data, the Department of Education will determine which race combinations (in addition to the five single race and four largest multiple race combinations) meet the one percent threshold for the relevant jurisdictions. The Department then will provide guidance to educational institutions on how racial and ethnic data should be aggregated and reported. c. Collection of Data on Race and Hispanic Ethnicity In addition to collecting data on race, the Department of Education and educational institutions at various state and local levels also collect information on Hispanic ethnicity. The tabulation of information on Hispanic ethnicity and race in light of the 1997 standards raises some challenging 69   questions. As with the collection and aggregation of detailed data on race, the Department of Education recognizes the importance of obtaining more complete Hispanic origin information to facilitate effective civil rights monitoring and enforcement. However, the burden on educational institutions must be considered and balanced. There are three potential options for a unified tabulation approach for data on race and ethnicity. Some suggest that Hispanic or Latino data do not need to be tabulated by race. This suggestion is supported by an effort to minimize the burden on data collectors as well as evidence that many who identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino do not select a race (estimates range up to 30 percent). Others have suggested that the collection of data on race for those of Hispanic or Latino origin that mirror the non-Hispanic categories would create a symmetry that facilitates understanding and implementation. Alternatively, the collection of Hispanic or Latino data by some but not all racial categories could balance the need for the racial identification of Hispanics for civil rights enforcement with the burden on data collectors. Once the Department of Education reviews the results of Census 2000, the Department will reach a final decision on what data will be collected on the racial identification of Hispanic/Latino individuals. In general, educational agencies that collect data need three years from these final decisions to reconfigure their systems for the collection of racial and ethnic data under the 1997 categories. In the interim, educational institutions may collect information in greater detail than is presently required as long as any additional categories can be aggregated back into the minimum set of categories.  70   4. Enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 All agencies that enforce regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, are obligated to follow the guidance provided in this document and OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, which addresses aggregating and allocating data on race for civil rights enforcement and monitoring. The Title VI Coordination Regulations at 28 C.F.R.  42.406, provide that all agencies ""shall in regard to each assisted program provide for the collection of data and information from applicants for and recipients of Federal assistance sufficient to permit effective enforcement of [T]itle IV."" All agency Title VI regulations provide for the collection of such data. Agencies currently follow the categories set forth in the Title VI Coordination Regulations, which ""are in conformity with the OMB Ad Hoc Committee on Race/Ethnic Categories' recommendations."" See 28 C.F.R.  42.302(e). The section states, however, that to the extent that these designations are modified by OMB, the regulation is to be interpreted to be consistent with any such OMB modifications. See 28 C.F.R.  42.402(e)(5). Accordingly, the categories listed in the regulation are no longer in effect. The 1997 revised standards, effective October 30, 1997, require all Federal agencies with Title VI compliance and enforcement obligations to provide for the collection of data by offering respondents the option of selecting one or more of the following racial categories: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White  Pursuant to OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, agencies are instructed to tabulate data on race using the five single race categories outlined above plus the following four multiple race combinations most likely to occur: 1. 2. 3. 4. American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American  Agencies are also advised to tabulate additional multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population at issue and include these combinations as part of any tabulation. Thus, all agency tabulations for data on race should reflect a minimum of ten categories: the five single race categories, the four multiple race categories, and a balance category. In surveys where there are additional multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population at issue, those categories should be included in any final tabulation.  71   All agencies with Title VI enforcement responsibilities should also be aware that OMB Bulletin No. 00-02 provides guidance for the allocation of multiple race responses for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement. Pursuant to that guidance, the following rules apply:    Responses in the five single race categories will not be allocated. Responses that combine one minority race and white are allocated to the minority race. Responses that include two or more minority races are allocated as follows:   If the enforcement action is in response to a complaint, a multiple race response will be allocated to the race that the complainant alleges the discrimination was based on. If the enforcement action requires assessing disparate impact or discriminatory patterns, analyze the patterns based on alternative allocations to each of the minority groups.  Under the 1997 standards, ""Hispanic or Latino"" is an ethnic category, not a racial category. Where agencies collect data on race and ethnicity separately, ethnicity must be collected first. In such cases, provisions shall be made to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are ""Hispanic or Latino"" and who are ""Not Hispanic or Latino."" All agencies must modify all new and revised record keeping or reporting forms that include racial and/or ethnic information to conform to the 1997 standards. All existing record keeping or reporting requirements must be consistent with these standards at the time they are submitted for extension, but not later than January 1, 2003. Agencies should note that OMB is the final arbiter of all modifications to racial and ethnic categories used in Federal data collection instruments. Executive Order No. 12250 gives the Attorney General authority to ensure the consistent and effective enforcement of Title VI and other nondiscrimination statutes that apply to recipients of Federal financial assistance. That authority has been delegated to the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. The Division, through the Coordination and Review Section, will ensure that all agencies are aware of the 1997 standards and are taking appropriate steps to implement the OMB guidance. The Division's Coordination and Review Section will be available to Federal agencies to assist them in this endeavor.  72   B. Intercensal Estimates and Vital Records Following some background discussion, this section presents a description of the Census Bureau's Intercensal Population Estimates Program, its data sources, methodology, and major uses, and then discusses some of the important issues that must be addressed in implementing the 1997 standards in this program. Background. In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting. Because the intercensal population estimates are limited in their detail by the availability of administrative data, it was 1993 before the program could implement fully the 1977 standards by providing data for the population in the four racial categories of that standard -- White; Black; Asian or Pacific Islander; and American Indian or Alaskan Native. To comply with the 1977 standards, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program developed estimates by race separately for the population by Hispanic origin (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic). The 1997 standards present many challenges, with two in particular posing the greatest challenges. One is that respondents to Federal data collections, including Census 2000, surveys, and vital statistics registrations, will be allowed to select one or more races. The other is that the Asian or Pacific Islander category has been split into two categories -- one called ""Asian"" and the other called ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander."" The population estimates are data driven. Changes to the program to produce estimates for new racial categories will depend upon the availability of data from a variety of sources. Although changes are possible, discussions with data providers and data users, as well as research and analysis of data collected using the 1997 standards, will be required before the Census Bureau can identify the racial categories that can be used in the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Because the intercensal population estimates serve several diverse purposes, exploring possible outcomes of the estimates process and examining the implications of the 1997 are important. The issues raised by the 1997 standards are complicated and diverse. It considerable research and experimentation before the Intercensal Population Estimates can produce population estimates that fully follow the 1997 standards. the standards will take Program  The next sections describe the program and discuss the major issues that must be addressed in changing program outputs. 1. Description of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program The Intercensal Population Estimates Program, under Title 13, develops and releases annual estimates of the total population and its demographic characteristics. For the Nation, states, and counties, these characteristics include annual estimates by: age (single years of age (age 0 to age  73   99) and 100+); sex (male/female); race (White; Black; Asian and Pacific Islander; and American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut); and Hispanic origin (Hispanic/Non-Hispanic). The Intercensal Population Estimates Program currently provides estimates of the total population of functioning governmental units (cities, incorporated places, and minor civil divisions). The Census Bureau is considering expansion of the program to include smaller and more diverse units of geography (such as school districts), as well as the development of demographic characteristics for functioning governmental units and other smaller geographic units. 2. Uses of Population Estimates The population estimates are used in the intercensal period for funding allocations, as controls for Census Bureau and other Federal surveys, as denominators for vital statistics and other demographic events, and as planning tools for government and private programs and policy decisions. Funding Allocations. Federal programs totaling $180 billion use these annual population estimates to make program decisions and to distribute these funds. Survey Controls. The population estimates are used as control totals for the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the new American Community Survey (ACS), other Federal surveys, and many private sector surveys. Most Federal surveys use national level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. The ACS currently uses county level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. Denominators for Demographic Events. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) currently uses the national, state, and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators to create birth and death rates and to calculate life tables by race and sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) frequently relies upon the estimates of population at various geographic levels as denominators for various health related and disease incidence rates. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) uses the county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators for the various cancer incidence rates released to the public. Planning Tools. The intercensal population estimates are frequently used as planning tools and as barometers to measure an area's growth and change since the last decennial census. In making policy decisions, local planners frequently cite the overall population level and the demographic characteristics products of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program.  74   3. Methodology for Developing Intercensal Population Estimates The Intercensal Population Estimates Program develops its population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin using the demographically recognized cohort-component technique. In this technique, each component of population change -- births, deaths, international migration, and internal migration -- is estimated separately by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Various administrative records provide information needed to develop these components of population change. The estimates process begins with the most recent decennial census results and combines the estimated components of population change to develop the intercensal population estimates. The 1990 Census Base Population. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net undercoverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made in the distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. (See Comparability Issues below for a discussion of the modification of the 1990 decennial census.) Birth and Death Components. In brief, NCHS provides annual counts and distributions of births and deaths by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin by county to the Census Bureau in a specially developed individual record file of the birth and death events. These individual records contain the detailed race and Hispanic classifications available from the birth and death certificates collected by NCHS. International Migration Component. The international net migration components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. The Census Bureau estimates the distribution by race and Hispanic origin from the country-of-birth tallies, using data from the 1990 Census on the foreign-born population who entered the United States from 1985 to 1990. The other components of international migration such as emigration and undocumented migration are developed using a combination of basic demographic modeling techniques. By examining data from other administrative records in combination with an analysis of the decennial census, the Census Bureau models the level and demographic characteristics of these other international migration components. Internal Migration Component. Data on internal migration are developed using a basic administrative records method. This method relies on annual extracts of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In this approach, using the Social Security Number (SSN) on the return, the Census Bureau can match the tax returns for two years and obtain state of residence for the two periods. By comparing the state of residence at the two points in time, annual measures of migration can be developed for states.  75   Until recently, the Census Bureau had only developed the national population estimates by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population for states and counties. During the current decade, the Census Bureau started to develop a set of state and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. The state population estimates are developed using the basic cohort component technique outlined above. Since the standard tax return provides no demographic characteristics of the tax filer, the Census Bureau must further modify the basic administrative records method to estimate internal migration by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To obtain demographic characteristics, the Bureau has relied on the annual extract of tax returns provided by the IRS, and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration (SSA) Application File (NUMIDENT). This NUMIDENT file includes SSN, month and year of birth, race, sex, and six characters of the last name for each SSN holder in the sample file. The extract of the NUMIDENT file has been merged with the tax returns file by SSN to derive demographic characteristics of IRS filers. Because the Census Bureau was able to receive only a 20 percent sample of this basic NUMIDENT file, the Bureau appended the demographic characteristics of the primary filer to only the same 20 percent sample of tax returns. Besides demographic characteristics of the primary filers, the model requires demographic characteristics of those persons claimed as exemptions on the tax return. The rules for assigning demographic characteristics to dependents are straightforward and rely on basic familial and demographic relationships. Because the NUMIDENT File was restricted to a 20 percent sample until this year, the Census Bureau could not use the merged tax file and SSA data to develop county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To develop the current sets of county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, a ratio approach is employed. This approach combines the full set of age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin detail for the county in 1990 with the newly developed state population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population of the county. With the delivery of the 100 percent NUMIDENT file to the Census Bureau, work on employing the cohort component technique to develop the county estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin is anticipated. 4. Data Availability The intercensal population estimates are ""data driven."" As noted above, the decennial census, the National Center for Health Statistics, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Social Security Administration are all important sources for developing intercensal population estimates. Using the current methodology, estimates cannot be produced without the availability of these data. Decennial Census Data. Census 2000 is the first time that decennial population data are available using the 1997 standards for collecting racial data.  76   Birth and Death Data. The National Vital Statistics System is the basis for the Nation's official statistics on births and deaths (including infant deaths). The data are provided through vital registration systems maintained and operated by the individual states and territories where the original certificates are filed. While the legal authority for vital registration rests with the states and territories, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is required to produce national vital statistics by collecting data from the vital records of all the states. The NCHS cooperates with the states in developing the standard forms for data collection as well as standard procedures for data preparation and processing in order to promote a uniform national data base. The degree of uniformity necessary for national statistics has been achieved by periodic issuance of recommended standards by the responsible national agency (NCHS) and the cooperative adoption of these standards by the individual registration areas. These standards include the U.S. Standard Certificates of Live Birth. The standard certificates have been the principal means for achieving the uniformity in information on which national statistics are based; the standard certificate of live birth has been revised 11 times since 1900. The standard certificates represent the minimum basic data set necessary for the collection and publication of comparable national, state, and local vital statistics data. Also participating in this effort to produce quality, consistent data is the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), the association of State registrars. Because the State certificates have multiple uses, many factors must be considered and evaluated in deciding what should be included in the recommended standards. Faced with the many uses -- legal, administrative, public health, statistical -- of vital records, NCHS and the state vital statistics offices must make choices regarding the inclusion or exclusion of data items for each revision of the certificate. The NCHS shares in the costs incurred by the states through contractual agreements with each state. Under this arrangement, NCHS obtains and publishes vital statistics based on all births and deaths (e.g., 3,891,494 and 2,314,690, respectively, in 1996) occurring in the United States. Implementation of the 1997 standards on vital records will require changes in data collection and processing systems at all levels of government and very likely will take at least several years to accomplish throughout the United States. In addition to revising computer systems at the state and Federal levels, the electronic software that is used in hospitals to record and report over 90 percent of all births in the United States needs to be converted. Most importantly, the procedures used to collect birth and death data in hospitals and funeral homes will need to be revised and the appropriate staff will need to be trained. During 1998 and 1999, NCHS sponsored a committee of state vital statistics officials and representatives of the relevant professions in a series of meetings to evaluate the entire content and format of the current Standard Certificates. It can be anticipated that not all registration areas will implement the 1997 standards at the same time or with complete coverage and compliance at the start. Only one state has implemented the revised race question on birth and death certificates in the year 2000. Most others will wait until the next revisions of the U.S. Standard Certificates of Birth and Death are implemented in 2003. 77   International Migration Components. As discussed above, the international migration components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. To develop data on the race and Hispanic origin of the entering immigrants, the Census Bureau combines the information on country of birth from the INS files with information from the most recent decennial census. Because the INS and other data sources on international migration do not code race or Hispanic origin, no change in these sources is anticipated. The Census Bureau will need to examine the results of Census 2000 and develop new algorithms to accommodate the 1997 categories for data on race. Internal Migration Components. To develop the internal migration component, the Census Bureau currently relies upon the annual extract of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration (SSA) Application File (NUMIDENT). Under an agreement between the Census Bureau and SSA, the Census Bureau has recently gained access to a full 100 percent NUMIDENT file. This opens additional opportunities for developing population estimates below the national level by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. This component also presents the biggest obstacle to modifying categories for data on race in the intercensal population estimates process. Under the Social Security system, data on race are provided as part of the Social Security card application process. For the oldest among the population currently covered in the NUMIDENT files, the last application date could refer to the beginning of the Social Security system. Until 1980, the SSA application system provided three racial categories -- White, Black, and Other. Beginning in 1980, the SSA modified the racial categories on the SSA application form to include five categories -- (1) Asian, Asian-American or Pacific Islander; (2) Hispanic; (3) Black (non-Hispanic); (4) North American Indian or Alaskan Native; (5) White (non-Hispanic). Although SSA modified the racial categories application card, people who already had an SSA card did not have to resubmit their data on race. Thus, pre-1980 entries on the SSA file have information for three racial categories (White, Black, and Other), while entries after 1980 have information for five racial categories. The application for a Social Security card needs to be updated to reflect the 1997 standards. Another change to the Social Security application procedure has presented challenges to the use of data on race. Beginning in the late 1980's, the SSA introduced the ""enumeration at birth program."" Under this program, parents could request a social security number for their newborn 78   children with the birth registration process. Because the birth certificates do not include racial information for the newborn, it is impossible to code race for the newborn onto the SSA file. While information on race is available for the birth mother and father on the basic birth registration certificate, these data are not made available to SSA and are not on the basic NUMIDENT file received by the Census Bureau. 5. Comparability Issues Even the availability of the required source data does not ensure the capability to produce reasonable and accurate population estimates. Production of population estimates by the major demographic characteristics depends upon the availability of comparable data across the various data sources. While comparability issues with respect to race reporting are not new, the increased complexities of new racial categories are likely to exacerbate the problems. The issues about comparability in race reporting are present in the current set of intercensal population estimates. Data from the 1990 census on race posed several of these problems. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net under coverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made to that distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. For age, the aim was to correct biases in census age tabulations that resulted from displacement of age reporting from the reference date of the census. In 1990 census publications, age is based on respondents' direct reports of age at last birthday, with some editing for age misstatement. This definition proved inadequate for postcensal estimates; many respondents reported their age (even if correctly) at the time of completion of the census form or interview by an enumerator, either of which could have occurred several months after the April 1 reference date. As a result, age was slightly biased upward. Modification was based on a respecification of age, for most individual respondents, according to their year of birth. Age was derived from year of birth by allocating date of birth to the first quarter and last three quarters of each year, subtracting year of birth from 1990 for those born before April 1, and from 1989 for those born after April 1. The allocation was based on an historical series of registered births by month. For race, the objective of the modification was to conform to the definition of race specified in the 1977 standards. In the 1990 census, a substantial number of people (roughly 9.8 million) did not specify a racial group that could be classified in any of the categories on the census form: White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander. A large majority of these people were of Hispanic origin (based on their response to a separate, Hispanic origin question on the form), and many wrote in their Hispanic origin, or Hispanic origin type (for 79   example, Mexican or Puerto Rican) as their race. People of unspecified race were allocated to one of the four tabulated racial groups (White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo or Aleut; and Asian or Pacific Islander) based on their response to the Hispanic origin question. These four categories for race conform with the 1977 standards, and are more consistent with the categories in other administrative sources than are the original census tabulations. When combining across data sets and agencies, the problems of comparability in reporting of race become more severe. Clearly, the added complexity of reporting more than one race will add to this problem, particularly as different reporting situations (such as the census or the birth and death certificates) engender differential tendencies to report more than one race. Differences in allocation and editing procedures will almost certainly exacerbate the problem as exemplified by the problem of using data from different data universes in the calculation of rates. Comparability of race data from the Census 2000 and from vital statistics will be more problematic until the Vital Statistics System adopts the new data collection standards in 2003. NCHS, Census Bureau, and OMB jointly sponsored a workshop in July 2000 which was conducted by the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department of The George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services and the Metropolitan Washington Public Health Assessment Center. The aim of the workshop was to develop a research agenda designed to address these problems. Workshop participants identified several research strategies that could be used to address the technical and methodological issues that the 1997 standards for data on race and ethnicity raise for vital statistics and population estimates, and to address some of the more conceptual and perceptual aspects of race and ethnicity that influence reporting in censuses, surveys, and vital records. A summary of the workshop is being prepared. Selected research strategies are summarized below: Census or Survey-based Matching Studies: In such studies, the race and ethnicity reported on birth or death certificates could be compared with the race and ethnicity reported for those individuals in the decennial census or surveys such as the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey. The participants also recommended the continuation of the National Longitudinal Mortality Studies. Studies of Selected Vital Records: Although NCHS works with the states to establish a standard set of data on births and deaths to be reported to the Federal Government, the original data collection process is established and managed by each individual state. As a result, some states are collecting additional data on race and ethnicity that could be used to study features of race and ethnicity reporting in vital records and to explore how reporting may change under the 1997 standards. NCHS is investigating the possibility of 80   obtaining additional race information for a selected number of states for methodological purposes. Studies to Identify Sources of Error: A careful study of the potential sources of error -both bias and random variation -- in the data and procedures used to produce population estimates would provide valuable guidance to both the producers and users of those estimates. Some of the sources of error include the census undercount and undercount adjustments, missing data and imputation procedures, and misreporting and misclassification of data. The 1997 standards will not change the types of error in the data but will introduce specific new forms of error, such as misreporting or misclassification between single- and multiple-race categories, that need to be understood. The proposed matching studies would help identify and quantify some types of bias in the data. Techniques like multiple imputation can be used to assess variance. Studies of the accuracy of estimates and projections: The Census Bureau produces population estimates and projections for states and communities, but states also produce independent estimates of their populations, which may differ from Census Bureau estimates. Studies are needed to compare the accuracy of Census Bureau and state estimates and to identify the sources of discrepancy. Studies on Race and Ethnicity: Proposals for other studies emphasized opportunities to improve data on race and ethnicity by gaining a better understanding of the meaning of racial and ethnic identities in society and of the factors that influence both selfidentification and identification of others. One suggestion was to look at how race and ethnicity were reported in Census 2000 for those in multiple race households. Studies might also use routinely conducted surveys like the Current Population Survey or the National Health Interview Survey to ask about the race of respondents' parents and other ancestors to learn more about the older roots of multiple race identities. An additional source of noncomparability results from the fact that the standard certificate of live birth includes items asking for the race of the mother and the race of the father. At no time have the certificates included a question on the race of the child. In 1988 and prior years, NCHS assigned a race to the child solely for statistical purposes. Births were tabulated by this assigned race of the child, which was created from information reported for the race(s) of the parents as entered on the birth certificate. When the parents were of the same race, as was the case for 95 percent of births with race reported for both mother and father in 1998, the child was assumed to be of the same race. If the parents were of different races and one parent was white, the child was assigned the race of the parent who was not white. When the parents were of different races, and neither parent was white, the child was assigned, for statistical purposes, to the father's race, with one exception: if either parent was Hawaiian, the child was assigned to Hawaiian. If race was missing for one parent, the child was assigned the race of the parent for whom race was reported. 81   In 1989, NCHS changed its tabulation procedures and began tabulating births by the race of the mother. The most important factor influencing this decision was the 1989 revision of the birth certificate. This revision includes many more health questions that are directly associated with the mother (e.g., method of delivery, medical risk factors, tobacco and alcohol use, and maternal weight gain). Many of the other items that have been on the birth certificate since 1969 or even earlier also relate directly to the mother; for example, age, educational level, and receipt of prenatal care. In all these instances it is more appropriate to tabulate births by the mother's race. A second factor influencing the decision to tabulate births by race of mother is the large proportion of births with race of father not reported, 14 percent in 1998. Although this proportion has declined slightly in the 1990's, it is still higher than in 1978, 11 percent. The high proportion of records with the father's race not reported reflects the increase in the proportion of births to unmarried women; in many such cases, no information is reported on the father. These births are already assigned the race of the mother because there is no alternative. Tabulating all births by race of mother, therefore, provides for a more uniform approach, rather than a necessarily arbitrary combination of parental races. It is important to keep in mind that the public use data files that NCHS produces and disseminates include both the mother's and father's races as reported on the birth certificate. Researchers and others may tabulate the birth data by race of the mother, by race of the father, or by race of the child as determined by the algorithm previously used by NCHS, or an alternative as they wish. For purposes of research based on data from the birth certificate itself, it is generally most appropriate to tabulate the birth data by the race of the mother. NCHS has re-tabulated all of the trend data on births by race of mother for the years beginning with the 1980 data year. To facilitate continuity and analysis of the data, trend tables showing data for years prior to 1980 show data for both race of mother and race of child. This makes it possible to distinguish the effects of this change from real changes in the data. There continues to be interest in collecting and reporting birth data according to the ""race of the child"" and this would be particularly relevant for developing population estimates. Over the last several years, this concept has been discussed by the panel charged with developing the forthcoming revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. The panel revising the certificate did not recommend that an item on the child's race be added to the birth certificate. As mentioned earlier, each state has its own certificate of live birth, and in most cases state certificates closely follow the content and format of the U.S. Standard Certificate. Individual states may choose to add an item asking for the ""race of the child,"" even though the item is not on the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. NCHS and colleagues in state vital statistics offices continue to research this issue.  82   6. Future Direction The process of developing a set of intercensal population estimates consistent with the 1997 standards will not be an easy one. Until data are available, making any commitments about the probable set of products is impossible. The Census Bureau realizes, however, that many data users need to know its plans in order to make their own program decisions. To begin this process, the Census Bureau is forming a technical interagency group of key data providers and key data users to address many of the major issues. Members of this group will provide input on: (1) the feasibility of using one consistent set of categories on race across all geographic levels; (2) the feasibility of using population size as the only criterion for determining which categories by race will have separate population estimates; (3) the minimum cell size below which population estimates will not be produced; (4) the continued development of population estimates by mutually exclusive categories on race; and (5) the use of consistent methodologies for the different categories by race in the population estimates program. This technical group will also examine issues related to data allocation and editing -- important factors related to the data consistency issues. Detailed data on race from Census 2000 will not be available until mid 2001. In the meantime, the interagency group can address and reach consensus on most of the issues outlined above. Through these discussions with the data providers and data users, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program can begin to form some tentative plans. Although it is too soon to speculate on any outcomes, it is likely that the Intercensal Population Estimates Program will need to be flexible. During the coming decade, as more data become available using the 1997 standards, it is likely that the Census Bureau will continue the expansion of the population estimates program to include additional categories by race. C. Uniform Crime Reporting Program The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program was established by the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 1929. The UCR Program has as its primary mission the collection of uniform national crime statistics for the express purpose of assisting law enforcement across the Nation in strategic planning in the war against crime. Currently, nearly 17,000 city, county, and state law enforcement agencies voluntarily participate in the program. Even though it is often assumed that UCR statistics consist of a monolithic statistical collection effort, the UCR Program in reality comprises several programs, all with different data collection requirements. Approximately 89 percent of the crime reported to the FBI is through the Summary Reporting System. The Summary System reflects aggregate tallies of crime information from law enforcement agencies, and the collection of data on race is limited to arrest information only. 83   UCR data are additionally collected through the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted Program, the Hate Crime Data Collection Program, and the National Incident-Based Reporting System  all of which provide for the collection of data on race. Race is usually determined by observation on the part of the responding officer or the victim of the crime, rather than selfidentification. Any effort to collect information on race by self-identification is either difficult or impossible due to the reliance on third-party information or the sensitive nature of handling the response to a criminal incident. The information collected in the UCR Program is a complex derivative of law enforcement operational databases. As such, the primary application of any UCR statistics, including those involving race, is by law enforcement in the examination of crime trends. The data provide law enforcement a unique means by which to conduct analyses, ranging from limited agency-specific to broadly multijurisdictional, in order to plan strategically for the maximum use of limited law enforcement resources. In concurrence with other national criminal justice operational databases managed by the FBI (e.g., National Crime Information Center and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, etc.), the UCR Program currently uses the four race categories specified by the 1977 standards. Incorporation of the 1997 standards into the UCR Program is being considered within the context of the burden such implementation would place upon law enforcement agencies in their participation in a voluntary program, and the feasibility of collecting the information in accordance with the 1997 standards within the confines of the normal law enforcement operational setting.  84   CHAPTER 5 COMPARING DATA COLLECTED UNDER THE 1997 AND THE 1977 STANDARDS  This chapter is a summary of the Bridge Report: Tabulation Options for Trend Analysis, which is provided in Appendix C. A. Introduction Agencies whose data are used to display time trends in economic, social, and health characteristics by racial and ethnic groups may need to consider bridging methods to assist users in understanding the data collected under the 1997 standards. For some period of time, referred to as the bridge period, agencies may use two estimates. The first, a tabulation of the data collected under the 1997 standards (see Chapter 3, Part B), and the second, a ""bridging estimate"" or prediction of how the responses would have been collected and coded under the 1977 standards. The bridging estimate is designed only for analyzing historical trends in data series. Once the bridge period is over, the bridge estimates will no longer be needed. It should not be assumed that bridging is useful or required in every situation. Agencies should carefully consider whether they need bridging estimates. Bridging estimates may not be needed if agencies can tolerate a ""break"" in their data series or if comparison to another data series provides users with enough information about the change. If bridging estimates are not used, however, agencies should footnote the first occurrence of data collected under the 1997 standards. There are at least two purposes of bridge estimates: (1) to help users understand the relationship between the old and new data series (as noted above); and (2) to provide consistent numerators and denominators for the transition period, before all data are available in the new format. If there is a need for bridging, agencies should carefully evaluate alternative methods. The work presented in Appendix C, and summarized below, is intended to help inform agencies about the statistical characteristics of selected bridging methods. Agencies are encouraged to plan and conduct methodological research that will lead to more informed decisions concerning bridging methods and their uses. Such methodological research has long been used to quantify changes in data collection procedures. For example, when methods for coding industry, occupation, or diseases are updated, it is common practice to code data using both sets of coding rules to determine the nature and extent of the changes introduced by the change in procedures. The analyses presented in Appendix C make use of survey data in which the same respondent provided racial information in response to both a question structured under the 1977 standards 85   and to questions similar to those that might be structured under the 1997 standards. These are examples of methodological approaches that can be adopted by agencies, if necessary. In particular, since 1976, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has added a follow-up question for those reporting more than one racial identity, asking them to select the one that they feel best describes them. This information is directly used in some of the most promising bridge techniques. Some agencies may want to use such a follow-up question experimentally to provide valuable, survey-specific information for bridging to the past. As agencies conduct such experiments, the results may assist other agencies in understanding the changes associated with transitioning to the 1997 standards. The results discussed here and in Appendix C represent the work of a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from Federal statistical agencies that use and produce data on race and ethnicity. They have spent the past three years considering these tabulation issues and conducting research to develop tabulation guidelines for constructing ""bridges"" between racial data collected under the 1997 standards and racial data collected under the 1977 standards. The report sets forth criteria by which different bridging methods should be evaluated and describes the different methods that have been considered thus far. The results of the research conducted on several methods for creating bridges are also presented. This part of the report discusses different options for tabulating racial data in order to create bridges from data collected under the 1997 standards, which have five racial categories and permit the reporting of more than one race, back to the data collected under the previous standards, which identified four racial categories and asked respondents to select one. An ""Other"" category appears in much of the analysis, because it is included in the decennial census and some other surveys. All of these methods (and the research on them reported here) involve the use of individual-level records. Analysis is limited to data collected using the separate questions for race and Hispanic origin. Under the 1997 standards, when reporting is based on self-identification, the twoquestion format is to be used; even in the case of observer identification, this is the preferred format. It is expected that some users will bridge to a distribution created using the combined format for the question on race and ethnicity. Thus, bridging both to the old racial distribution arising from the use of two questions and one based on a combined, single question are analyzed. The latter analyses required the creation of a combined distribution from data collected using the two-question format. It should be clearly understood that this is a ""manufactured"" distribution and may be different from one obtained when actually using a combined question format. Based on the research, the strengths and weaknesses of each bridging method are discussed. The last two sections of this chapter discuss weighting data collected under the 1997 standards to 1990based population controls and suggested bridging strategies for users of the new racial and ethnic data.  86   B. Methods for Bridging The goal of developing bridging methodology for data on race is to identify a statistical model that will take individuals' responses to the new questions on race and classify those responses as closely as possible to the responses we hypothesize they would have given using the old single race categories. Such a task will be relatively easy or be more difficult depending on how an individual identifies himself or herself under the 1997 standards. For bridging purposes, individuals with a single racial background are likely to identify as they did before, and no statistical model is needed for bridging. However, those with a mixed racial heritage who were previously required to identify only one part of their background may, under the 1997 standards, choose to report more than one racial identity. When a person identifies with more than one racial group, some model will be necessary to translate those multiple responses into the one, single response we hypothesize that the individual most likely would have reported under the 1977 standards. 1. Framework Several different methods have been identified for creating a single race distribution from data including multiple race responses. These methods vary in both the assumptions that are made and the procedures that are followed. Before describing the particular methods examined in this report, it is useful to describe some of their major underlying characteristics. One major distinction among the methods is whether an individual's responses are assigned to a single racial category (termed whole assignment) or to multiple categories (termed fractional assignment). Whole assignment can be based on a set of deterministic rules or based on some probabilistic distribution. For example, a deterministic rule might assign all White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, while a probabilistic rule might randomly assign 60 percent of the White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, and 40 percent into the White category. In the above example, it is unlikely that all individuals identifying as White and American Indian under the 1997 standards would have previously identified as American Indian, so the deterministic rule will result in misclassifications for all those people who had previously identified as White. With a probabilistic rule, an individual's responses are randomly assigned to either the American Indian category or the White category (such as with 60 percent and 40 percent probabilities, respectively, based on previously collected data). However, even if the overall probabilities matched exactly the aggregate distribution under the 1977 standards, there is no guarantee that the 40 percent who were categorized as White would have classified themselves that way. In fact, in the worst case, all 40 percent who were classified as White would actually have identified as American Indian under the 1977 standards, and a corresponding percentage of those categorized as American Indian would have identified as White.  87   When fractional assignment is used, multiple race responses are categorized into more than one category where each category receives a fraction of a count, and the sum of the fractions equals one. In the above examples of whole assignment, a person's responses were placed into one and only one category, in an attempt to mimic the past. An alternative is to use a deterministic rule to assign some fraction of the multiple race responses to each of the racial categories identified. For example, a multiple response of White and American Indian might count as ""one-half"" in the tabulations for American Indians and ""one-half"" in the tabulations for Whites. These fractions, like the probabilities in the earlier example, could be varied for different combinations of multiple races to attempt to reflect how often people might identify with one group compared with another. 2. Bridge Tabulation Methods All of the bridge tabulation methods focus on the assignment of the responses from individuals who identify with more than one racial group. Responses from individuals who identify with a single racial group under the 1997 standards are assumed to have been the same under the 1977 standards. The response ""Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander"" is assigned to the old racial category of ""Asian or Pacific Islander."" The specific methods for assigning multiple race responses into single race categories are Deterministic Whole Assignment, Deterministic Fractional Assignment, and Probabilistic Whole Assignment. Two sets of results for each of the following tabulation methods are produced. The first set ignores the use of any auxiliary information other than that needed to carry out the particular tabulation method. The other set of results for each method uses the one piece of information that is certain to be common to all data collections done following the 1997 standards, that is, ethnicity. Thus, whether or not an individual is Hispanic is taken into account when a tabulation method is used. Deterministic whole assignment. This method uses fixed, deterministic rules for assigning multiple responses back to one and only one of the racial categories from the 1977 standards. Four alternatives are examined. The first (Smallest Group) assigns responses that include White and another group to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the fewest number of individuals identifying that group as a single race. The second alternative (Largest Group Other Than White) assigns responses that include White with some other racial group, to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the highest single-race count. The third alternative (Largest Group) assigns responses with two or more racial groups into the group with the largest number of individuals as a single race. In this latter case, any combination with White is assigned to the White category, and combinations that do not include White are assigned to the group with the largest single-race count. The fourth alternative (Plurality) assigns responses based on data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS has permitted respondents to select more than one race for a number of years, with only the first two 88   responses captured. However, respondents reporting more than one race were given a follow-up question asking them to select the one race with which they most closely identify (called Main Race here). For these respondents, the proportion choosing each of the two possibilities as their main race was calculated. All responses in a particular multiple-race category using the Plurality method are assigned to the group with the highest proportion of responses on the follow-up question about main race. Deterministic fractional assignment. This method uses fixed, deterministic rules for fractional weighting of multiple-race responses, that is, assigning a fraction to each one of the individual racial categories that are identified. These fractions must sum to 1. Two alternatives are examined. The first (Deterministic Equal Fractions) assigns each of the multiple responses in equal fractions to each racial group identified. Thus, responses with two racial groups are assigned half to each group; those with three groups are assigned one-third to each, etc. The second alternative (Deterministic NHIS Fractions) assigns responses by fractions to each racial group identified, with the fractions drawn from empirical results from the NHIS (as described above). Probabilistic whole assignment. This method uses probabilistic rules for assigning multiple race responses back to one and only one of the previous racial categories. Two alternatives are examined. These parallel the two alternatives discussed under Deterministic Fractional Assignment, except that, for a given set of fractions, the response is assigned to only one racial category. The fractions specify the probabilities used to select a particular category. The first alternative uses equal selection probabilities. The second uses the NHIS fractions where possible, and equal fractions when no information is available from NHIS. Probabilistic Whole Assignment will yield nearly, on average, the same population counts as Deterministic Fractional Assignment. Only the results from Deterministic Fractional Assignment are presented in this report. In practice, there would be a difference between Deterministic Fractional Assignment and Probabilistic Whole Assignment when computing variances for tabulated estimates, and the two methods would yield relatively small differences in distributions for respondent characteristics. In general, Probabilistic Whole Assignment would yield a higher estimated variance than the Deterministic Fractional approach, with the variances for both methods underestimating the true variance. Probabilistic methods which incorporate a ""Multiple Imputation"" statistical technique would result in an unbiased estimate of variance, but at the price of being more difficult to implement (See Rubin 1987.). All Inclusive. A final tabulation method considered is termed the ""All Inclusive"" method. Under this method all responses are used. Responses are assigned to each of the categories that an individual selects. The sum of the categories totals more than 100 percent.  89   C. Methods of Evaluation 1. Data Sources National Health Interview Survey. The NHIS is a continuing nationwide sample survey designed to measure the health status of residents of the United States (Benson and Marano, 1995; Massey et al., 1989). The analysis here uses data from an analytic file that contains three years of NHIS data (1993, 1994, and 1995). For each of these years there were about 45,000 households interviewed, resulting in slightly more than 100,000 individuals per year. The total sample for the bridge analysis is 323,080 (5237 respondents did not provide data on race). Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to choose more than one racial category. As the respondent is handed a card with numbered racial categories, the interviewer asks, ""What is the number of the group or groups that represents your race?"" If a respondent selects more than one category, the interviewer then asks, ""Which of those groups would you say best describes your race?"" Although the listed racial groups have changed over time, for 1993 to 1995, the card shown to respondents included 16 separate racial categories (White, Black, American Indian, Aleut, Eskimo, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Asian Indian, Samoan, Guamanian, and other Asian and Pacific Islander. In addition, although not on the flashcard, respondents were allowed to give an ""other"" race response.) To be consistent, the 16 groups were collapsed to the four previous racial categories: White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN), and Asian or Pacific Islander (API), plus Other. For this analysis, a variable called Detailed Race was created from responses to the first question, which allowed identification with more than one racial group. This information is not included on public use data files of the NHIS. However, on internal files, the first two race groups mentioned are recorded for each observation. Even if a respondent selected more than two groups, only two were recorded on the intermediate file. From the two recorded racial responses, Detailed Race was coded into five single race groups (White, Black, AIAN, API, Other) and 11 multiple race groups (White/Black, White/AIAN, White/API, White/Other, Black/AIAN, Black/API, Black/Other, AIAN/API, AIAN/Other, and API/Other. For most analyses, multiple race combinations that had insufficient numbers were aggregated into the category ""Other Combinations."") Individuals who had two racial groups recorded for Detailed Race but a third group recorded for the ""group that best describes race"" were coded into ""Other Combinations."" The Main Race variable, used as a reference point representing the racial distribution under the 1977 standards, is primarily derived from Detailed Race and the responses to the second question, which asks the respondent for the group that best describes his/her race (Benson and Marano, 1995). For respondents who selected one Detailed Race group, Main Race is the same as Detailed Race. For respondents who selected more than one racial group, Main Race is the one 90   group reported as best describing their race. Some respondents who had chosen more than one race for the Detailed Race question responded as ""Multiple race"" or ""Other"" for the Main Race question. For this analysis, these responses were combined into the ""Other"" category. Categories for Main Race were White, Black, AIAN, API, and Other. The combined race and ethnicity variable, referred to here as ""Combined Main Race,"" uses the respondent's answer to an Hispanic origin question to reassign the respondent to the Hispanic category. The Hispanic origin question used is the following: Are any of these groups (the respondent's) national origin or ancestry? At the same time, the interviewer hands the respondent a card listing Hispanic groups as categories: Puerto Rican, Mexican, Cuban, Mexican American, Chicano, Other Latin American, and Other Spanish. For this report, Whites, Blacks, Others, and those reporting more than one race who identified with any of the Hispanic groups were categorized as Hispanic and not according to their race. Asians, American Indians, and Alaska Natives were not reclassified. If a respondent did not answer the Hispanic origin question, he or she was assumed to be non-Hispanic. May 1995 Supplement on Race and Ethnicity to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The May 1995 CPS Supplement was one in a series of studies conducted for the Federal agencies' review of the standards for data on race and ethnicity. The Supplement was designed to address the following issues: (1) the effect of having a ""multiracial"" race category among the list of races; (2) the effect of adding ""Hispanic"" to the list of racial categories; and (3) the preferences for alternative names for racial and ethnic categories (e.g., African-American for Black, and Latino for Hispanic). The Supplement was organized into four panels representing a two-by-two experimental design for studying the first and second issues outlined above. Each panel was given to one-fourth of the sample, or about 15,000 households (30,000 individuals). All respondents in a household received the same set of questions; household members 15 years and older were asked to respond for themselves, and parents answered for children under 15. Only two of the panels in the CPS Supplement permitted respondents to report in a multiracial category (panels 2 and 4), and only one panel had separate race and Hispanic origin questions (panel 2) as ultimately recommended in the 1997 standards. Therefore, panel 2 data were used to analyze the effects of the different tabulation methods for the two-question format. The new Hispanic question, preceding the race question, simply asked whether or not the respondent was Hispanic. The smaller sample (about 30,000 observations) hampers analysis and generalizations when the focus is on the small portion of the sample (about 1 percent) who identified as ""multiracial."" There are additional limitations to these data for evaluating the bridging methods. The option respondents were given to identify multiple races in the CPS Supplement was a multiracial category with a follow-up question asking respondents to indicate all the racial groups with which they identified. The 1997 standards allow people to identify directly with all the racial 91   groups they choose and do not include a ""multiracial"" category. Furthermore, a large percentage of individuals who chose the multiracial category in panel 2 of the Supplement did not specify more than one racial group (see Tucker et al., 1996). For purposes of this evaluation, individuals were classified as belonging to the specific racial categories they identified. Those who identified as being multiracial but then did not give two or more specific racial groups were reclassified in the one racial category they gave. Thus, the distribution of the CPS Supplement data reported here differs from that which was published in earlier reports, which classified as multiracial any person who identified with the multiracial category even if they only specified one racial group. This new distribution is referred to here as the ""Edited Distribution."" This edited distribution was used with the various tabulation methods. As in NHIS, the resulting distributions were compared to a reference distribution based on the respondents' original answers (in the first CPS interview) to the race question that followed the 1977 standards. The combined race and ethnicity format, still referred to as the reference distribution in the relevant tables, uses the respondent's answer to the Hispanic origin question to reassign the respondent to the Hispanic category. For this report, Whites, Blacks, Others, and those reporting more than one race who identified with any of the Hispanic groups were categorized as Hispanic and not according to their race. Asians, American Indians, and Alaska Natives were not reclassified. If a respondent did not answer the Hispanic origin question, he or she was assumed to be non-Hispanic. 1998 Washington State Population Survey. The 1998 Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) was designed to provide information on Washington residents between decennial censuses. The survey collected data on employment, income, education, and health, along with basic demographic information. The WSPS was done by telephone and included 7,279 households with telephones. Blacks, Asians, Hispanics and American Indians were over sampled. The designated respondent was the individual with the greatest knowledge about the household. The respondent weights reflect this over sampling and, thus, results are representative of the Washington population as a whole. The response rate for the entire sample was between 50 and 60 percent. Information about the race of the respondent was collected twice during the course of the interview. At the beginning of the survey, the respondent was asked, ""Are you of Hispanic origin?"" Following that question, the respondent was asked, ""What is your race?"" The categories were the ones appearing under the 1977 standards, but the order was as follows: Black; American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; Asian or Pacific Islander; and White. An ""Other"" category also was allowed, and the interviewer recorded the verbatim response on a ""specify"" line. Near the end of the survey, the respondent was asked race questions conforming to the 1997 standards. Besides the same Hispanic origin question, the respondent was asked to specify country of origin. For race, the respondent was asked to select one or more categories. This time the ordering of the 92   categories was White; Black or African American (or Haitian or Negro); American Indian or Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Asian. Again, an ""Other"" category was provided. There also was a follow-up question for Asian respondents to specify country of origin. The results from the race question at the end of the survey were used with the tabulation methods. The reference distribution came from the answers to the original race question. A combined race/ethnicity format was not created from the WSPS data because unedited information from the race question using the 1977 format was unavailable. 2. Advantages and Disadvantages of These Data Sources Only the Washington State data closely resemble the way the question on race will be asked under the 1997 standards. Yet, all three can offer insights into the relationship between how individuals will actually respond to the 1997 question on race and how they responded to the question under the 1977 standards. The NHIS and the CPS Supplement are nationally representative, and the Washington State data serve as an example for evaluating the tabulation methods at the state level. Simulations using 1990 census data also were conducted, but the results differed little from those for the other data sets. At this point, it is believed that an analysis of data from the 1998 Dress Rehearsal for Census 2000 would be of greater utility. Furthermore, the Dress Rehearsal data will provide examples of the effects of the 1997 standards at the local level. Thus, this analysis will be included in the next version of this report. 3. Description of New Analyses The analyses concentrated on the bridge tabulation methods. These analyses can be divided into three broad areas: (1) descriptions of racial distributions under the alternative bridging tabulation methods; (2) rates of racial ""misclassification"" for these alternatives; and, (3) sensitivity of outcome measures to the bridging alternatives. Distribution of Race. For the first phase of the analysis (using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the data from Washington State), the distributions of race under the allocation alternatives described previously were calculated: All Inclusive, Deterministic Whole Allocation (Smallest Group, Largest Group Other Than White, Largest Group, and Plurality) and Fractional Allocation (Equal Fractions and NHIS Fractions). These new distributions were compared to the reference distribution in each data set. At this time, it is unknown what percentage of people in the United States will identify with more than one racial group when given the opportunity to do so in Census 2000 and in subsequent surveys. For purposes of illustrating the effects of a greater proportion of individuals identifying more than one racial background, analyses were conducted increasing the proportion of multiple race responses two-, four-, six- and eight-fold using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State micro data sources. The racial distributions were compared using each of the tabulation methods to see effects with increasing levels of reporting more than one race. Of necessity, these tabulations assume that the increases are the 93   same across the different combinations of more than one race. The accuracy of this assumption cannot be tested. The purpose of these analyses is not to attempt to make accurate predictions about the extent of multiple race reporting or its composition, but rather to see more clearly possible differences among tabulation methods that may become apparent only with a greater percentage of more than one race reporting. Misclassification of Race. Besides evaluating the overall racial distributions produced by the tabulation methods, the misclassification of individuals also needs to be examined. For the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State survey, these misclassification rates were formed by comparing an individual's answer to the race question under the 1977 standards to the assigned category of the individual's response(s) to the race question under the 1997 standards using each of the tabulation methods. The misclassification rate and its standard error for each race by tabulation method were produced. Preliminary Outcomes Assessment. In the last phase of the analysis, the impact of multiplerace reporting on outcome measures was assessed. This process is important because users in many of the Federal agencies are not typically examining race distributions, but rather trends and indicators for the Nation (e.g., health outcomes, economic well-being, educational attainment) across racial groups. This is where the majority of work will need to be done within individual agencies as the 1997 standards are implemented. An initial examination of how common statistics could be affected by reporting of more than one race was conducted. Five outcome measures were examined, three from the NHIS and two from the CPS Supplement. From the NHIS, three routine health outcomes were calculated: percent of respondents in poor or fair health, percent of children living with a single mother, and percent of respondents with no health insurance. From the CPS Supplement, the proportions of respondents who were unemployed and the labor force participation rates for different racial groups were calculated. These estimates based on the bridging alternatives are not meant to be precise measures of these factors, but are used to demonstrate the possible impact reporting of multiple races and the tabulation methods may have on these and similar estimates. D. Examination of the Results with Respect to the Evaluation Criteria Bridging to the past will be needed for measuring change in a variety of circumstances. Besides measuring population growth, any number of economic, social, and health outcomes must be monitored. This work will involve different population groups at different levels of geography. As a first step toward providing the information users will need to make informed decisions about the methods, the strengths and weaknesses of the bridging methods with respect to the evaluation criteria outlined at the beginning of this report are discussed, based on the results of the statistical analyses conducted. The details of these statistical analyses can be found in Appendix C.  94   Measure Change Over Time. As indicated earlier, measuring change over time is the criterion that is of greatest importance in evaluating the bridging methods. The first and second phases of the analysis shed light on the performance of the various methods in this area. In essence, an ideal bridging method in this case is one that not only accurately recreates the population distribution under the 1977 standards such that the only difference remaining is a function of true change over time, but also assigns an individual's response to the old category that would have been chosen. The methodology used in these studies allows users, within limits, to see how well the bridging methods using racial data collected under the 1997 standards can match data from the same respondents collected (at about the same time) under the 1977 standards. To the extent that there is a match, any change that would occur from this point forward would indicate true change. If the match is poor, it is not possible to isolate the true change. When comparing the different methods to their reference distributions (whether using only the race question or the combined format), the racial categories that were most sensitive to which method is chosen were the numerically small ones, particularly the AIAN category. While different data sets were used in each study and the racial questions were not the same, the studies indicate that the Largest Group Deterministic Whole Assignment method, the Plurality method, and the two Deterministic Fractional Assignment methods produce distributions closer to the reference distributions than do the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method. Controlling for ethnicity had no effect on these results. One reason the Largest Group Assignment method results are so close is that it has little effect on the smaller racial groups, because most assignments are made to Black or White, and the percentages for these two races are so large that the relatively small increase they receive is not noticeable. The Plurality method produces a good fit, because it makes assignments at the level of specific racial combinations. The performance of the NHIS Fractional Assignment method can be discounted to a degree in the NHIS study because the analysis is somewhat circular; however, the results from the CPS Supplement and the Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) show this method yields a relatively close match. The Equal Fractional Assignment method produces a reasonable match in these studies. The primary reason that the other two Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method do not perform as well is that they alter the White percentage to some extent and substantially increase the percentage in the AIAN category. In the case of misclassification rates, some contradictory results emerge, both when using the race question alone and when using the combined format. While the AIAN and ""Other"" categories have high misclassification rates across all tabulation methods in the CPS Supplement, the same is not true for the other two surveys. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment methods produce the most comparable results for the AIAN category in both surveys and for the ""Other"" category in the WSPS; however, these methods have higher overall misclassification rates. Both the CPS Supplement and the WSPS have large misclassification rates for these two categories when using many of the tabulation methods. 95   When the distributions of the outcome variables are examined, all methods produce comparable, and relatively close matches for all health outcomes. For the AIAN unemployment rate, the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method appear to produce the least comparable results, but none of the differences is significant. There are significant differences in the AIAN labor force participation rates for several of the tabulation methods. It is likely that which method is best at matching a reference distribution for outcome measures will depend on the outcome being examined. Unfortunately, the data to assess the best tabulation method for each outcome may never be readily available. All of these conclusions should these studies. It is unclear how these responses could differ by Furthermore, most of this work samples at that. be viewed with caution. Many assumptions had to be made in people will respond to the new racial question in the future, and mode of data collection and with the subject of the survey. on developing bridging methods relied on sample data, and small  Congruence with Respondent's Choice. This criterion concerns how well the full range of the respondent's choices is represented in the racial distribution. It is more important for evaluating ongoing tabulations under the 1997 standards, but the bridging methods can be differentiated with respect to this criterion, too. None of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods takes into account the full range of the respondent's selections, but the Plurality method at least controls for the particular racial combination chosen by the respondent under the 1997 standards. The All Inclusive method accurately reflects all selections by tabulating actual responses and not people. The Equal Fraction Assignment method tabulates people, but, like the All Inclusive method, treats all responses equally. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method takes all responses into account, but assignment is based on attempting to estimate in which single-race category the respondent would prefer to be counted. Range of Applicability. This criterion refers to how well the bridging method can be applied in different contexts. The All Inclusive method provides the same results in every context, because assignment does not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution. This method is not suitable for users who need a distribution that adds to 100 percent. Of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods, the Largest Group Assignment method is the least sensitive to context and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are as easy to use as the Largest Group Whole Assignment method, but the results for the small racial categories will vary to a greater extent with the context, particularly according to level of geography. The Equal Fraction Assignment method is as generalizable as the All Inclusive method, but it is not quite as easy to use. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method may be the most problematic, because they currently represent only a national preference distribution based on data from 1993 to 1995. The use of this distribution at the local level would be likely to produce inaccurate results in a number of cases. That is not to say that the other methods do not face the same problem. 96   Meet Confidentiality and Reliability Standards. Because these methods all attempt to reproduce the racial categories under the 1977 standards, the same confidentiality problems that existed over the last 20 years will continue to exist. No increase in problems is anticipated. In the case of reliability, however, the situation is different. The All Inclusive method will not produce less reliable data than data produced under the 1977 standards. The Equal Fraction Assignment method may have reliability problems as a result of adding only fractional counts to some of the smaller categories if these categories have a high probability of being chosen as the preferred single race. The same would be true if equal fractions were used to make whole assignments. In sample surveys, the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods will have reliability problems to the extent that there is a large variance on the individual race proportions. This is likely to occur when small samples are involved. The Largest Group Whole assignment method should have the fewest problems with respect to reliability, and the Smallest Group Whole Assignment method will likely have the most. These methods have another problem, however, in that an individual's response may be assigned to different categories at different levels of geography. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method, as well as methods where fractions are used for whole assignment (i.e., the Plurality method), is based upon a sample distribution with its own variance properties. Reliability for the very small combinations will be quite bad unless many years of data are combined, and this presents its own problems. Minimize Disruptions to the Single Race Distributions. This criterion is relevant only for evaluation of bridging methods. Its purpose is to see how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the 1997 standards. To the extent that a bridging method can meet the other bridging criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportions in the ongoing distribution, it will have value for looking both forward and backward in time. An evaluation of the different methods according to this criterion involves the comparison of the bridge distributions to the detailed race distribution under the 1997 standards in each case. For the CPS Supplement, the Plurality method is marginally closer than the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the Fractional methods. While the All Inclusive method and the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods match for the White category, they differ substantially from the single-race AIAN category in the detailed distribution and are marginally worse for the API category. The NHIS Fractional method is the closest in both the NHIS and WSPS. Statistically Defensible. To be statistically defensible, the bridging method must conform to acceptable statistical conventions. The All Inclusive method makes no assumption about how respondents would assign themselves in the single race situation. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method are based on an observed distribution, and, to that extent, involve less judgment than the rest of the methods that assign people and not responses. While the Equal Fractional Assignment method is based on judgment, it does not make assumptions about the relative importance of any given race. The Largest Group Whole Assignment method 97   does assign greater importance to one of the races, but it also follows common, but different, statistical practice than the equal fraction approach. Both attempt to minimize the error in assignment. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment method and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment method do not follow statistical practice, but, instead, rely on the historical record of discrimination; even in these cases, however, the assigned category is based on an observed distribution. Ease of Use. ""Ease of use"" refers to how complicated it is to produce the bridge results. The Equal Fractional Assignment method makes assignments that do not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution at hand. It and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method do require the duplication of individual records or the creation, on every record, of a variable for each racial category under the 1977 standards in order to be able to assign fractions for any combination of categories. If the fractional methods are used to assign a respondent to a single category (whole probabilistic methods), this cumbersome process can be avoided. The All Inclusive method, like the Equal Fractional method, does not depend on the particular distribution, but it does produce proportions that add to more than 100 percent unless they are raked or recalculated to a base of 100 percent each time. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the NHIS Fractional method would require an extra step unless only national figures are used, because the relative size of the groups must be determined for each detailed distribution. Otherwise, they are as easy to use as the whole probabilistic methods. Skill Required. This criterion refers to the skills required to carry out the bridge operations. The amount of computer expertise to perform the operations associated with each of these methods is fairly trivial. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods require almost no statistical knowledge. Some familiarity with the statistical adjustment literature would be useful for understanding the Deterministic Fractional Assignment procedures. If the All Inclusive method were used, users might need to understand statistical raking. Understandability and Communicability. This criterion concerns how easily the methods can be explained and understood by the average user. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are both easy to explain and easy to understand. The fractional assignment of individuals to a single category also is not difficult to follow. Assigning fractions of a person to different categories may be easy to explain, but the average user may find it difficult to accept the idea. The All Inclusive method also is easily explained, but, unless the percentages are raked to 100 percent, users may have a problem understanding how to use the results. E. Weighting When Appropriate Population Controls Are Not Available For those using the new racial categories in surveys prior to the release of new population controls from Census 2000 (expected in 2002), a method is needed to allow the use of the updated  98   1990 controls. The following advice is provided for researchers who find themselves in this situation: 1. 2. 3. 4. Choose a whole-allocation bridging method. Create a bridged distribution using the chosen method. Rake this bridged distribution to the 1990-based controls. Use the final weight from this process when reporting distributions for the new racial categories, including the multiple-race combinations. 5. Provide the following caveats to data users: (a) weighting was not done using controls based on the new definitions, and (b) the bridged distribution is not necessarily the same as would have been obtained using the old race question. Choosing a whole-allocation bridging method will simplify the task. Data producers should select the bridging method that they judge to be the most appropriate for their data users. Provide any available information to evaluate the likely discrepancies between the bridged distribution and the distribution that would have been obtained using the old question. Reweighting to the new controls, once they become available, is strongly recommended. F. Strategies for Users This section suggests strategies for bridging that depend on the user's needs. In providing these strategies, two assumptions are made. The first is that the user is interested in the analysis of an historical data series. The second assumption follows from the first, and it is that the user will not simply be doing cross-sectional estimates of the current counts in the racial categories or the present and future characteristics of these populations. It should be noted that all of the bridging methods would require, to some extent, prior knowledge of population characteristics when working at the local level. If the user wants to examine change across the whole racial distribution, the Plurality method or one of the Fractional Allocation methods will likely provide the best approximations to the distributions from the past. They actually are based on information concerning how the respondents would have answered the question on race under the previous standards. While the new distribution should reflect only the growth in the racial categories due to population change and not methodological change, most of the other methods produce a substantial increase in the size of the American Indian and Alaska Native population not attributable to change over time. Accompanying the increase in the AIAN category is a corresponding decrease in the White category. Other distortions could occur as the size of the population identifying with more than one race grows. If the user is interested in a particular racial category, which method is chosen will depend on whether the user wants to err on the side of inclusion or exclusion, especially for the smaller 99   racial groups. Use of the Smallest Group method or the Largest Group Other Than White method will include a substantial number of individuals that might have identified with the larger racial group in the past. The characteristics of the group might change simply as a result of their inclusion. This is particularly the case for the AIAN category, and the differences between methods with respect to inclusion or exclusion will be greatest in areas having a large AIAN population, such as the state of Washington. Analysis of the combined race/ethnicity format indicates that the choice of tabulation method has little effect on Hispanics. It should be remembered, however, that these results are based on the use of a ""manufactured"" variable and may not truly represent what would occur if an actual combined format had been used in the past. It is also the case that the AIAN category is still affected by the choice of bridging method when using the combined format. The choice of bridging method also could depend on the substantive characteristics of interest. Some characteristics may not be affected by the particular bridging method chosen. Others will show more change with one method or another. In these cases, which bridging method is used will depend upon what the user is trying to discover. As noted above, health outcomes appeared not to be affected by the choice of bridging method, but economic outcomes were. Geographic characteristics also could affect the choice of bridging method. The user may have knowledge of local populations that would dictate which method should be used. For instance, the user might know that in a particular area Whites also are likely to identify as American Indian when given the opportunity, but, if forced to select a single race, they would almost certainly choose White. This knowledge might lead the user to use a bridging method that minimizes assignment to the American Indian and Alaska Native category. The fact that the Smallest Group method and the Largest Group Other Than White method give larger counts for the smaller racial groups might favor their selection in some circumstances. Reliability and confidentiality standards normally would restrict the analysis of these categories. Even though these bridging methods may produce less than ideal comparisons to the past, the larger size of the categories resulting from using these methods could increase analytical power enough to draw conclusions. Although the selection of a bridging method should be for substantive or methodological reasons, simplicity cannot be discounted altogether. Users must have both the substantive knowledge and methodological skill to use the more complicated methods. They also must be able to explain them and defend them.  100   References Benson, V. and Marano, M.

Contents  iii   How to Use This Census Report The appendixes contained in this volume supplement the Census 2000, Summary Social, Economic, and Housing Characteristics reports for the United States, states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These reports provide sample data based on both the 100-percent and the sample questions. Population characteristics data include disability status; earnings in 1999; educational attainment; employment status; full-time, year-round workers in 1999; income in 1999; journey to work; language spoken at home and ability to speak English; nativity; place of birth; poverty status in 1999; residence in 1995; school enrollment and type of school; veteran status; and work status in 1999. Housing characteristics data include bedrooms; gross rent; house heating fuel; kitchen facilities; mortgage status; occupancy; owner costs; plumbing facilities; rental cost; rooms; telephone service available; tenure; units in structure; value of home; vehicles available; year moved into unit; and year structure built. In prior decennial census publications, the appendixes that explained these subjects, geographic terms and concepts, and other general product information were included with the statistical tables; for Census 2000, these appendixes are found in this volume. Appendix A, Geographic Terms and Concepts. Provides definitions of the types of geographic areas and related information in census products. Appendix B, Definitions of Subject Characteristics.

INTRODUCTION--GEOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF DATA  A15 A14 A22 A22 A23 A23 A22 A23 A23 A22 A23 A23 A18 A16 A24 A8 A24 A24 A20  In decennial census data products, geographic entities usually are presented in an hierarchical arrangement or as an inventory listing. Hierarchical Presentation An hierarchical geographic presentation shows the geographic entities in a superior/subordinate structure. This structure is derived from the legal, administrative, or areal relationships of the entities. The hierarchical structure is depicted in report tables by means of indentation and is explained for computer-readable media in the geographic coverage portion of the abstract in the technical documentation. An example of hierarchical presentation is the ``standard census geographic hierarchy'': census block, within block group, within census tract, within place, within county subdivision, within county, within state, within division, within region, within the United States. Graphically, this is shown as: United States Region Division State County County subdivision Place (or part) Census tract (or part) Block group (or part) Census block Figure A1, which is a diagram of the geographic hierarchy, presents this information as a series of ``nesting'' relationships. For example, a line joining the lower-level entity ``place'' and the higherlevel entity ``state'' means that a place cannot cross a state boundary; a line linking ``census tract'' and ``county'' means that a census tract cannot cross a county line; and so forth. Inventory Presentation An inventory presentation of geographic entities is one in which all entities of the same type are shown in alphabetical, code, or geographic sequence, without reference to their hierarchical relationships. Generally, an inventory presentation shows totals for entities that may be split in a hierarchical presentation, such as place, census tract, or block group. An example of a series of  Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A3   inventory presentations is state, followed by all the counties in that state, followed by all the places in that state. Graphically, this is shown as: State County A County B County C Place X Place Y Place Z American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land (AIANA/HHL) Entities Exceptions to the standard hierarchical presentation occur in the case of some American Indian/Alaska Native area (AIANA) entities, which do not necessarily ``nest'' within states and counties. For instance, the following American Indian entities can cross state lines: federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, tribal subdivisions, and tribal designated statistical areas. National summary data for American Indian reservations may be presented as an alphabetical listing of reservation names followed by the state portions of each reservation. Also, a census tract or block group delineated by American Indian tribal authorities may be located in more than one state or county (see CENSUS TRACT, TRIBAL BLOCK GROUP, and TRIBAL CENSUS TRACT) for the purpose of presenting census data in the American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land (AIANA/HHL) hierarchy. The diagram in Figure A2 shows geographic relationships among geographic entities in the AIANA/HHL hierarchy. It does not show the geographic levels ``county,'' ``county subdivision,'' and ``place'' because AIANA/HHL entities do not necessarily nest within them. The definitions below are for geographic entities and concepts that the U.S. Census Bureau includes in its standard data products. Not all entities and concepts are shown in any one data product. AMERICAN INDIAN AREA, ALASKA NATIVE AREA, HAWAIIAN HOME LAND There are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data for Census 2000. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations, and Hawaiian home lands. The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas, Oklahoma tribal statistical areas, tribal designated statistical areas, and state designated American Indian statistical areas. Tribal subdivisions can exist within the statistical Oklahoma tribal statistical areas. In all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no American Indian, Alaska Native, or Hawaiian home land can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas, which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations. In some cases where more than one tribe claims jurisdiction over an area, the U.S. Census Bureau creates a joint use area as a separate entity to define this area of dual claims. The following provides more detail about each of the various American Indian areas, Alaska Native areas, and Hawaiian home lands. Alaska Native Regional Corporation (ANRC) Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are corporate entities established to conduct both business and nonprofit affairs of Alaska Natives pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-203). Twelve ANRCs are geographic entities that cover most of the state of Alaska (the Annette Island Reservean American Indian reservationis excluded from any ANRC). (A thirteenth ANRC represents Alaska Natives who do not live in Alaska and do not identify with any of the 12 corporations; the U.S. Census Bureau does not provide data for this ANRC because it has no geographic extent.) The boundaries of ANRCs have been legally established. A4 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   The U.S. Census Bureau offers representatives of the 12 nonprofit ANRCs the opportunity to review and update the ANRC boundaries. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for ANRCs for the 1990 census. Each ANRC is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, which is assigned in alphabetical order by ANRC name. Alaska Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA) Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs) are statistical entities that represent the densely settled portion of Alaska Native villages (ANVs), which constitute associations, bands, clans, communities, groups, tribes or villages, recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-203). ANVSAs are reviewed and delineated by officials of the ANV (or officials of the Alaska Native Regional Corporation (ANRC) in which the ANV is located if no ANV official chooses to participate in the delineation process) solely for data presentation purposes. An ANVSA may not overlap the boundary of another ANVSA, an American Indian reservation, or a tribal designated statistical area. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for ANVSAs for the 1990 census. Each ANVSA is assigned a national four-digit census code ranging from 6000 through 7999. Each ANVSA also is assigned a state-based five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code. Both the census and FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical order by ANVSA name. American Indian Reservation Federal American Indian reservations are areas that have been set aside by the United States for the use of tribes, the exterior boundaries of which are more particularly defined in the final tribal treaties, agreements, executive orders, federal statutes, secretarial orders, or judicial determinations. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes federal reservations as territory over which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. These entities are known as colonies, communities, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, villages, Indian communities, and Indian villages. The Bureau of Indian Affairs maintains a list of federally recognized tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations. Some state governments have established reservations for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state recognized American Indian reservations to the U.S. Census Bureau. The names of these reservations are followed by ``(State)'' in census data presentations. Federal reservations may cross state boundaries, and federal and state reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. For reservations that cross state boundaries, only the portions of the reservations in a given state are shown in the data products for that state. Lands that are administered jointly and/or are claimed by two tribes, whether federally or state recognized, are called ``joint use areas,'' and are treated as if they are separate American Indian reservations for data presentation purposes. The entire reservations are shown in data products for the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for American Indian reservations in the 1970 census. Each federal American Indian reservation is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 0001 through 4999. These census codes are assigned in alphabetical order of American Indian reservation names nationwide, except that joint use areas appear at the end of the code range. Each state American Indian reservation is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 9000 through 9499. Each American Indian reservation also is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code; because FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical sequence within each state, the FIPS code is different in each state for reservations that include territory in more than one state. Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A5   American Indian Off-Reservation Trust Land Trust lands are areas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual American Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off of a reservation. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority over these lands. Primary tribal governmental authority generally is not attached to tribal lands located off the reservation until the lands are placed in trust. In the U.S. Census Bureau's data tabulations, off-reservation trust lands always are associated with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. Such trust lands may be located in more than one state. Only the portions of off-reservation trust lands in a given state are shown in the data products for that state; all off-reservation trust lands associated with a reservation or tribe are shown in data products for the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided trust land data for off-reservation tribal trust lands in the 1980 census; in 1990, the trust land data included both tribal and individual trust lands. The U.S. Census Bureau does not identify restricted fee land or land in fee simple status as a specific geographic category. In decennial census data tabulations, off-reservation trust lands are assigned a four-digit census code and a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code that is the same as that for the reservation with which they are associated. As with reservations, FIPS codes for off-reservation trust lands are unique within state, so they will differ if they extend into more than one state. The FIPS codes for such off-reservation trust lands are the same as those for the associated reservation. In the TIGER/Line products, a letter code``T'' for tribal and ``I'' for individual identifies off-reservation trust lands. In decennial census data tabulations, a trust land flag uniquely identifies off-reservation trust lands. Printed reports show separate tabulations for all off-reservation trust land areas, but do not provide separate tabulations for the tribal versus individual trust lands. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are presented and coded by tribal name, interspersed alphabetically among the reservation names. American Indian Tribal Subdivision American Indian tribal subdivisions are administrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), known as areas, chapters, communities, or districts. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indians on the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or OTSAs. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in the 1980 census when it identified them as ``American Indian subreservation areas.'' It did not provide data for these entities in conjunction with the 1990 census. Each American Indian tribal subdivision is assigned a three-digit census code that is alphabetically in order and unique within each reservation, associated off-reservation trust land, and OTSA. Each tribal subdivision also is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code. FIPS codes are assigned alphabetically within state; the FIPS codes are different in each state for tribal subdivisions that extend into more than one state. Hawaiian Home Land (HHL) Hawaiian home lands (HHLs) are areas held in trust for native Hawaiians by the state of Hawaii, pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, as amended. The U.S. Census Bureau obtained the names and boundaries of HHLs from state officials. HHLs are a new geographic entity for Census 2000. Each HHL area is assigned a national four-digit census code ranging from 5000 through 5499 based on the alphabetical sequence of each HHL name. Each HHL also is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within the state of Hawaii. A6 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area (OTSA) Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) are statistical entities identified and delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau in consultation with federally recognized American Indian tribes in Oklahoma that do not currently have a reservation, but once had a reservation in that state. Boundaries of OTSAs will be those of the former reservations in Oklahoma, except where modified by agreements with neighboring tribes for data presentation purposes. OTSAs replace the ``tribal jurisdiction statistical areas'' of the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for the former Oklahoma reservations in conjunction with the 1980 census, when it defined a single allencompassing geographic entity called the ``Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized areas).'' Each OTSA is assigned a national four-digit census code ranging from 5500 through 5999 based on the alphabetical sequence of each OTSA's name, except that the joint use areas appear at the end of the code range. Each OTSA also is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order in Oklahoma. State Designated American Indian Statistical Area (SDAISA) State designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs) are statistical entities for state recognized American Indian tribes that do not have a state recognized land base (reservation). SDAISAs are identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by a state liaison identified by the governor's office in each state. SDAISAs generally encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of people who identify with a state recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A SDAISA may not be located in more than one state unless the tribe is recognized by both states, and it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area, tribal designated statistical area (TDSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area. The U.S. Census Bureau established SDAISAs as a new geographic statistical entity for Census 2000, to differentiate between state recognized tribes without a land base and federally recognized tribes without a land base. For the 1990 census, all such tribal entities had been identified as TDSAs. Each SDAISA is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 9500 through 9999 in alphabetical sequence of SDAISA names nationwide. Each SDAISA also is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within state. Tribal Designated Statistical Area (TDSA) Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) are statistical entities identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have a federally recognized land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of people who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A TDSA may be located in more than one state, and it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area, state designated American Indian statistical area (SDAISA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for TDSAs in conjunction with the 1990 census, when both federally and state recognized tribes could identify and delineate TDSAs. TDSAs now apply only to federally recognized tribes. State recognized tribes without a land base, including those that were TDSAs in 1990, are identified as SDAISAs, a new geographic entity for Census 2000. Each TDSA is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 8000 through 8999 in alphabetical sequence of TDSA names nationwide. Each TDSA also is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within state; because FIPS codes are assigned within each state, the FIPS code is different in each state for TDSAs that extend into more than one state. Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A7   AREA MEASUREMENT Area measurement data provide the size, in square units (metric and nonmetric) of geographic entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates and disseminates data. Area is calculated from the specific boundary recorded for each entity in the U.S. Census Bureau's geographic database (see TIGER database). These area measurements are recorded as whole square meters. (To convert square meters to square kilometers, divide by 1,000,000; to convert square kilometers to square miles, divide by 2.589988; to convert square meters to square miles, divide by 2,589,988.) The U.S. Census Bureau provides area measurement data for both land area and total water area. The water area figures include inland, coastal, Great Lakes, and territorial water. (For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau provided area measurements for land and total water; water area for each of the four water classifications was available in the Geographic Identification Code Scheme (GICS) product only.) ``Inland water'' consists of any lake, reservoir, pond, or similar body of water that is recorded in the U.S. Census Bureau's geographic database. It also includes any river, creek, canal, stream, or similar feature that is recorded in that database as a twodimensional feature (rather than as a single line). The portions of the oceans and related large embayments (such as the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound), the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea that belong to the United States and its territories are classified as ``coastal'' and ``territorial'' waters; the Great Lakes are treated as a separate water entity. Rivers and bays that empty into these bodies of water are treated as ``inland water'' from the point beyond which they are narrower than one nautical mile across. Identification of land and inland, coastal, territorial, and Great Lakes waters is for data presentation purposes only and does not necessarily reflect their legal definitions. Land and water area measurements may disagree with the information displayed on U.S. Census Bureau maps and in the TIGER database because, for area measurement purposes, features identified as ``intermittent water'' and ``glacier'' are reported as land area. For this reason, it may not be possible to derive the land area for an entity by summing the land area of its component census blocks. In addition, the water area measurement reported for some geographic entities includes water that is not included in any lower-level geographic entity. Therefore, because water is contained only in a higher-level geographic entity, summing the water measurements for all the component lower-level geographic entities will not yield the water area of that higher-level entity. This occurs, for example, where water is associated with a county but is not within the legal boundary of any minor civil division. Crews-of-vessels entities (see CENSUS TRACT and CENSUS BLOCK) do not encompass territory and, therefore, have no area measurements. The accuracy of any area measurement data is limited by the accuracy inherent in (1) the location and shape of the various boundary information in the TIGER database, (2) the location and shapes of the shorelines of water bodies in that database, and (3) rounding affecting the last digit in all operations that compute and/or sum the area measurements. BLOCK GROUP (BG) A block group (BG) consists of all census blocks having the same first digit of their four-digit identifying numbers within a census tract. For example, block group 3 (BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. BGs on American Indian reservations, offreservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 300 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, worker's dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) Most BGs were delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local, state, or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local or tribal participant.  A8  Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   BGs never cross the boundaries of states, counties, or statistically equivalent entities, except for a BG delineated by American Indian tribal authorities, and then only when tabulated within the American Indian hierarchy (see TRIBAL BLOCK GROUP). BGs never cross the boundaries of census tracts, but may cross the boundary of any other geographic entity required as a census block boundary (see CENSUS BLOCK). In decennial census data tabulations, a BG may be split to present data for every unique combination of American Indian area, Alaska Native area, Hawaiian home land, congressional district, county subdivision, place, voting district, or other tabulation entity shown in the data products. For example, if BG 3 is partly in a city and partly outside the city, there are separate tabulated records for each portion of BG 3. BGs are used in tabulating data nationwide, as was done for the 1990 census, for all block-numbered areas in the 1980 census, and for selected areas in the 1970 census. For data presentation purposes, BGs are a substitute for the enumeration districts (EDs) used for reporting data in many parts of the United States for the 1970 and 1980 censuses and in all areas before 1970. Also, BGs are the lowest level of the geographic hierarchy for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates and presents sample data. BOUNDARY CHANGES Many of the legal and statistical entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates decennial census data have had boundary changes between the 1990 census and Census 2000; that is, between January 2, 1990, and January 1, 2000. Boundary changes to legal entities result from: 1. Annexations to or detachments from legally established governmental units. 2. Mergers or consolidations of two or more governmental units. 3. Establishment of new governmental units. 4. Disincorporations or disorganizations of existing governmental units. 5. Changes in treaties or executive orders, and governmental action placing additional lands in trust. 6. Decisions by federal, state, and local courts. 7. Redistricting for congressional districts or county subdivisions that represent single-member districts for election to a county governing board. Statistical entity boundaries generally are reviewed by local, state, or tribal governments and can have changes to adjust boundaries to visible features to better define the geographic area each encompasses or to account for shifts and changes in the population distribution within an area. The historical counts shown for counties, county subdivisions, places, and American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas are not updated for such changes, and thus reflect the population and housing units in each entity as delineated at the time of each decennial census. Boundary changes are not reported for some entities, such as census designated places and block groups. Changes to the boundaries for census tracts and, for the first time, for census blocks are available in relationship files, which are only available in computer-readable form. The census tract relationship files feature the relationship of census tracts/block numbering areas at the time of the 1990 census to census tracts for Census 2000, and vice versa, including partial relationships. For the first time, the census tract relationship files show a measure of the magnitude of change using the proportion of the length of roads and sides of roads contained in partial census tracts. This information can be used to proportion the data for the areas where census tracts have changed. The census block relationship files, which are available only in computer-readable form, present relationships of the 1990 census and Census 2000 blocks on the basis of whole blocks or part blocks (``P''). The following relationships can be derived: Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A9   --  1990 census block One to one ......................................................

Census tract relationship files and block relationship files are not geographic equivalency files. For a true areal comparison between the census tracts/block numbering areas and blocks used for the 1990 census and the census tracts and blocks used for Census 2000 (as well as other geographic areas), it is necessary to use the 2000 TIGER/Line files. The 2000 TIGER/Line files will contain 1990 and 2000 boundaries for counties and statistically equivalent entities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian areas, Alaska Native village statistical areas, census tracts, census blocks, and by derivation from the census blocks, block groups. CENSUS BLOCK Census blocks are areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries, such as city, town, township, and county limits, property lines, and short, imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Generally, census blocks are small in area; for example, a block bounded by city streets. However, census blocks in sparsely settled areas may contain many square miles of territory. All territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas has been assigned block numbers, as was the case for the 1990 census. To improve operational efficiency and geographic identifications, the U.S. Census Bureau has introduced different numbering systems for tabulation blocks used in decennial census data products, and for collection blocks, used in administering the census. (In 1990, there generally was a single numbering system.) Collection block numbers are available only in the TIGER/Line data products; the U.S. Census Bureau does not tabulate data for collection blocks. Many tabulation blocks, used in decennial census data products, represent the same geographic area as the collection blocks used in the Census 2000 enumeration process. Where the collection blocks include territory in two or more geographic entities, each unique piece required for data tabulation is identified as a separate tabulation block with a separate block number. It is possible for two or more collection blocks to be combined into a single tabulation block. This situation can occur when a visible feature established as a collection block boundary is deleted during the field update operation. Tabulation blocks do not cross the boundaries of any entity for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates data, including American Indian areas, Alaska Native areas, Hawaiian home lands, census tracts, congressional districts, counties, county subdivisions, places, state legislative districts, urban and rural areas, school districts, voting districts, and ZIP Code tabulation areas. Tabulation blocks also generally do not cross the boundaries of certain landmarks, including military installations, national parks, and national monuments. Tabulation blocks are identified uniquely within census tract by means of a four-digit number. (The 1990 census block numbers had three digits, with a potential alphabetic suffix.) The Census 2000 collection blocks are numbered uniquely within county (or statistically equivalent entity), and consist of four or five digits. For its Census 2000 data tabulations, the U.S. Census Bureau created a unique set of census block numbers immediately before beginning the tabulation process. These A10 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   are the census block numbers seen in the data presentations. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau created a separate block with a suffix of ``Z'' to identify crews-of-vessels population. For Census 2000, crews-of-vessels population is assigned to the land block identified by the U.S. Census Bureau as associated with the home port of the vessel. Participants in certain U.S. Census Bureau-sponsored programs were able to request that line features in the TIGER database be held as tabulation block boundaries, provided that these conformed to U.S. Census Bureau criteria. This option was available to participants in the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program (the Block Boundary Suggestion Project), American Indian and Alaska Native Area Tribal Review (Block Definition Project), and the District of Columbia and the Puerto Rico Block Boundary Definition Project. The U.S. Census Bureau introduced a different method for identifying the water areas of census blocks. For the 1990 census, water was not uniquely identified within a census block; instead, all water area internal to a block group was given a single block number ending in ``99'' (for example, in block group 1, all water was identified as block 199). A suffix was added to each water block number where the block existed in more than one tabulation entity within its block group. For Census 2000, water area located completely within the boundary of a single land tabulation block has the same block number as that land block. Water area that touches more than one land block is assigned a unique block number not associated with any adjacent land block. The water block numbers begin with the block group number followed by ``999'' and proceed in descending order (for example, in block group 3, the numbers assigned to water areas that border multiple land blocks are 3999, 3998, etc.). In some block groups, the numbering of land blocks might use enough of the available numbers to reach beyond the 900 range within the block group. For this reason, and because some land blocks include water (ponds and small lakes), no conclusions about whether a block is all land or all water can be made by looking at the block number. The land/water flag, set at the polygon level in the TIGER database and shown in TIGER/Line and statistical data tabulation files, is the only way to know if a block is all water when viewing the computer files. On maps, water areas are shown with a screen symbol. CENSUS DIVISION Census divisions are groupings of states and the District of Columbia that are subdivisions of the four census regions. There are nine census divisions, which the U.S. Census Bureau established in 1910 for the presentation of census data. Each census division is identified by a one-digit census code; the same number appears as the first digit in the two-digit census state code (see STATE). Puerto Rico and the Island Areas are not part of any census region or census division. For a list of all census regions, census divisions, and their constituent states, see Figure A3. CENSUS REGION Census regions are groupings of states and the District of Columbia that subdivide the United States for the presentation of census data. There are four census regions--Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Each of the four census regions is divided into two or more census divisions. Before 1984, the Midwest region was named the North Central region. From 1910, when census regions were established, through the 1940s, there were three census regions--North, South, and West. Each census region is identified by a single-digit census code. Puerto Rico and the Island Areas are not part of any census region or census division. For a list of all census regions, census divisions, and their constituent states, see Figure A3. CENSUS TRACT Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A11   census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). For Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not represent the same areas. Census tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is included with the related census tract. Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes. CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT (CD) Congressional districts (CDs) are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population to all other CDs in the state as practicable. The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 are those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999. The CDs of the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. These CD boundaries and numbers remained in effect until after Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting had required a change. Six states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states (New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. The 108th Congress will be the first to reflect reapportionment and redistricting based on Census 2000 data. CDs are identified with a two-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code. The code 00 is used for states with a single representative. A12 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and the District of Columbia are represented in the House of Representatives by a delegate, and Puerto Rico by a resident commissioner, all of whom may not vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, but may vote on legislation as it is considered by committees to which they have been named. In computerreadable data products that display a congressional district field, the two-digit FIPS code ``98'' is used to identify such representational areas. The Northern Mariana Islands does not have representation in Congress. The FIPS code ``99'' identifies areas with no representation in Congress. COUNTY (OR STATISTICALLY EQUIVALENT ENTITY) The primary legal divisions of most states are termed ``counties.'' In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the statistically equivalent entities are census areas, city and boroughs (as in Juneau City and Borough), a municipality (Anchorage), and organized boroughs. Census areas are delineated cooperatively for data presentation purposes by the state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states; these incorporated places are known as ``independent cities'' and are treated as equivalent to counties for data presentation purposes. (In some data presentations, they may be treated as county subdivisions and places.) The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the entire area is considered equivalent to a county for data presentation purposes. In American Samoa, the primary divisions are districts and islands; in the Northern Mariana Islands, municipalities; in the Virgin Islands of the United States, the principal islands of St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas. Guam has no primary divisions, and the entire area is considered equivalent to a county for data presentation purposes. Each county and statistically equivalent entity is assigned a three-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code that is unique within state. These codes are assigned in alphabetical order of county or county equivalent within state, except for the independent cities, which are assigned codes higher than and following the listing of counties. COUNTY SUBDIVISION County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and statistically equivalent entities for data presentation purposes. They include census county divisions, census subareas, minor civil divisions (MCDs), unorganized territories, and incorporated places that are independent of any MCD. Each county subdivision is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within each state. Census County Division (CCD) Census county divisions (CCDs) are county subdivisions that were delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state and local government officials for data presentation purposes. CCDs have been established in 21 states where there are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs), where the MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes, where the boundaries of the MCDs are ambiguous or change frequently, and/or where the MCDs generally are not known to the public. CCDs have no legal functions and are not governmental units. The boundaries of CCDs usually are delineated to follow visible features and coincide with census tracts where applicable. (In a few instances, two CCDs may constitute a single census tract.) The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location. CCDs have been established in the following 21 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Census Subarea Census subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs, census areas, city and boroughs, and the municipality (entities that are statistically equivalent to counties) in Alaska. Census subareas are delineated cooperatively by the state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau. They were first used for data presentation purposes in conjunction with the 1980 census. Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A13   Minor Civil Division (MCD) Minor civil divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states (parish in Louisiana). MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs are variously designated as American Indian reservations, assessment districts, boroughs, charter townships, election districts, election precincts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, road districts, supervisors' districts, towns, and townships. In some states, all or some incorporated places are not located in any MCD (independent places) and thus serve as MCDs in their own right. In other states, incorporated places are part of the MCDs in which they are located (dependent places), or the pattern is mixedsome incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs. Independent cities, which are statistically equivalent to a county, also are treated as a separate MCD equivalent in states containing MCDs. In Maine and New York, there are American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that serve as MCD equivalents; a separate MCD is created in each case where the American Indian area crosses a county boundary. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in the following 28 states: Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the city of Washington is considered equivalent to an MCD for data presentation purposes. Arlington County, VA, also has no MCDs and the entire county is designated as an MCD with the name Arlington. In the Island Areas, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the following entities as MCDs:  American Samoa: Counties (within the three districts; the two islands have no legal subdivisions).  Northern Mariana Islands: Municipal districts.  Guam: Election districts.  Virgin Islands of the United States: Census subdistricts. The MCDs in 12 states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) also serve as generalpurpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for these MCDs in all data products in which it provides data for places. In eight MCD states (Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, and South Dakota) the MCD townships serve as general-purpose local governments but do not have the ability to perform all the governmental functions as incorporated places. This category also includes the counties in American Samoa. Missouri is exceptional in that it has a minority of townships that serve as general-purpose governments (the majority of townships in Missouri fall into the category described below). In the remaining eight MCD states (Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia); the counties containing precincts in Illinois and Nebraska; the townships in Williamson County, Illinois; and the majority of townships in Missouri, the MCDs are geographic subdivisions of the counties and are not governmental units. The MCDs in Puerto Rico and the Island Areas (except American Samoa) also fall into this classification. Unorganized Territory Unorganized territories occur in 10 minor civil division (MCD) states (Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, and South Dakota) where portions of counties are not included in any legally established MCD or independent incorporated place. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes such areas as one or more separate county subdivisions A14 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   for purposes of data presentation. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation ``unorganized territory'' or ``UT.'' Unorganized territories were first used for data presentation purposes in conjunction with the 1960 census. GEOGRAPHIC CODE Geographic codes are shown primarily in computer-readable data products, such as computer tape and CD-ROM/DVD media, including data tabulations and data tables associated with computer-readable boundary files, but they also are shown on some U.S. Census Bureau maps. Census codes are used only if there is no Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for the same geographic entity or if the FIPS code is not adequate for data presentation. A code that is not identified as either ``census'' or ``FIPS'' is usually a census code for which there is no FIPS equivalent. Entities that use only FIPS codes in U.S. Census Bureau products are congressional district, county and statistically equivalent entity, county subdivision, subbarrio, Alaska Native Regional Corporation, metropolitan area (that is, metropolitan statistical area, consolidated metropolitan statistical area, primary metropolitan statistical area, and New England county metropolitan area), place, and state. (A census code exists for each state, but was not assigned in alphabetical sequence and serves to organize the states by census region and census division.) Census Code Census codes are assigned for a variety of geographic entities, including American Indian area, Alaska Native village statistical area, Hawaiian home land, census division, census region, urbanized area, urban cluster, state legislative district, school district, urban growth area, and voting district. The structure, format, and meaning of census codes used in U.S. Census Bureau data products appear in the appropriate technical documentation. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Code Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes are assigned for a variety of geographic entities, including American Indian area, Alaska Native area, Hawaiian home land, congressional district, county, county subdivision, metropolitan area, place, and state. The structure, format, and meaning of FIPS codes used in U.S. Census Bureau data products appear in the appropriate technical documentation. The objective of FIPS codes is to improve the ability to use the data resources of the federal government and avoid unnecessary duplication and incompatibilities in the collection, processing, and dissemination of data. The FIPS codes and FIPS code documentation are available online at http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/index.htm. Further information about the FIPS 5-2, 6-4, and 9-1 publications (states, counties, and congressional districts, respectively) is available from the Geographic Areas Branch, Geography Division, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-7400, telephone 301- 457-1099. Further information about the FIPS 55-DC3 publication (places, consolidated cities, county subdivisions, and noncensus locational entities) is available from the Geographic Names Office, National Mapping Division, U.S. Geological Survey, 523 National Center, Reston, VA 20192, telephone 703-648-4544. United States Postal Service (USPS) Code United States Postal Service (USPS) codes for states are used in all decennial census data products. The codes are two-character alphabetic abbreviations. These codes are the same as the Federal Information Processing Standards two-character alphabetic abbreviations. INTERNAL POINT An internal point is a set of geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) that is located within a specified geographic entity. A single point is identified for each entity; for many entities, this point represents the approximate geographic center of that entity. If the shape of the entity causes this point to be located outside the boundary of the entity or in a water body, it is relocated to land area within the entity. In computer-readable products, internal points are shown to six decimal places; the decimal point is implied. Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A15   The first character of the latitude or longitude is a plus (+) or a minus () sign. A plus sign in the latitude identifies the point as being in the Northern Hemisphere, while a minus sign identifies a location in the Southern Hemisphere. For longitude, a plus sign identifies the point as being in the Eastern Hemisphere, while a minus sign identifies a location in the Western Hemisphere. ISLAND AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES The Island Areas of the United States are American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Northern Mariana Islands), and the Virgin Islands of the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau treats the Island Areas as entities that are statistically equivalent to states for data presentation purposes. Geographic definitions specific to the Island Areas are shown in the appropriate publications and documentation that accompany the data products for the Island Areas. Sometimes the Island Areas are referred to as ``Island Territories'' or ``Insular Areas.'' For the 1990 and previous censuses, the U.S. Census Bureau referred to the entities as ``Outlying Areas.'' The term ``U.S. Minor Outlying Islands'' refers to certain small islands under U.S. jurisdiction in the Caribbean and Pacific: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands, Navassa Island, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island. METROPOLITAN AREA (MA) The general concept of a metropolitan area (MA) is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei. The MAs and the central cities within an MA are designated and defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget, following a set of official standards that are published in a Federal Register Notice. These standards were developed by the interagency Federal Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MAs nationwide. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a U.S. Census Bureau-defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). An MA contains one or more central counties. An MA also may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county. An outlying county must have a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as population density, urban population, and population growth. In New England, MAs consist of groupings of cities and county subdivisions (mostly towns) rather than whole counties. The territory, population, and housing units in MAs are referred to as ``metropolitan.'' The metropolitan category is subdivided into ``inside central city'' and ``outside central city.'' The territory, population, and housing units located outside territory designated ``metropolitan'' are referred to as ``nonmetropolitan.'' The metropolitan and nonmetropolitan classification cuts across the other hierarchies; for example, generally there are both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. To meet the needs of various users, the standards provide for a flexible structure of metropolitan definitions that classify each MA either as a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or as a consolidated metropolitan statistical area divided into primary metropolitan statistical areas. In New England, there also is an alternative county-based definition of MSAs known as the New England County Metropolitan Areas. (See definitions below.) Documentation of the MA standards and how they are applied is available from the Population Distribution Branch, Population Division, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-8800, telephone 301-457-2419. Central City In each metropolitan statistical area and consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the largest place and, in some cases, one or more additional places are designated as ``central cities'' under the official standards. A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have central cities. The A16 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities, are included in the title of the metropolitan area (MA); there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary. Consolidated and Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA and PMSA) If an area that qualifies as a metropolitan area (MA) has 1 million people or more, two or more primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) may be defined within it. Each PMSA consists of a large urbanized county or cluster of counties (cities and towns in New England) that demonstrate very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSAs are established, the larger MA of which they are component parts is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA). CMSAs and PMSAs are established only where local governments favor such designations for a large MA. Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) are metropolitan areas (MAs) that are not closely associated with other MAs. These areas typically are surrounded by nonmetropolitan counties (county subdivisions in New England). Metropolitan Area Title and Code The title of a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) contains the name of its largest central city and up to two additional central city names, provided that the additional places meet specified levels of population, employment, and commuting. Generally, a place with a population of 250,000 or more is in the title, regardless of other criteria. The title of a primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA) may contain up to three place names, as determined above, or up to three county names, sequenced in order of population size, from largest to smallest. A consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) title also may include up to three names, the first of which generally is the most populous central city in the area. The second name may be the first city or county name in the most populous remaining PMSA; the third name may be the first city or county name in the next most populous PMSA. A regional designation may be substituted for the second and/or third names in a CMSA title if local opinion supports such a designation and the federal Office of Management and Budget deems it to be unambiguous and suitable. The titles for all metropolitan areas (MAs) also contain the U.S. Postal Service's abbreviation for the name of each state in which the MA is located. Each MA is assigned a four-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, in alphabetical order nationwide. If the fourth digit of the code is ``2,'' it identifies a CMSA. Additionally, there is a separate set of two-digit FIPS codes for CMSAs, also assigned alphabetically. New England County Metropolitan Area (NECMA) New England county metropolitan areas (NECMAs) are defined as a county-based alternative to the city- and town-based New England metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSAs). The NECMA defined for an MSA or a CMSA includes:  The county containing the first-named city in that MSA/CMSA title (this county may include the first-named cities of other MSAs/CMSAs as well), and  Each additional county having at least half its population in the MSAs/CMSAs whose first-named cities are in the previously identified county. NECMAs are not identified for individual primary metropolitan statistical areas. Central cities of a NECMA are those places in the NECMA that qualify as central cities of an MSA or a CMSA. NECMA titles derive from the names of these central cities. Each NECMA is assigned a four-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code. Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A17   PLACE Places, for the reporting of decennial census data, include census designated places, consolidated cities, and incorporated places. Each place is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, based on the alphabetical order of the place name within each state. If place names are duplicated within a state and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal description (for example, ``city'' before ``village''). Census Designated Place (CDP) Census designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. For Census 2000, for the first time, CDPs did not need to meet a minimum population threshold to qualify for tabulation of census data. For the 1990 census and earlier censuses, the U.S. Census Bureau required CDPs to qualify on the basis of various minimum population size criteria. Beginning with the 1950 census, the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state and local governments (and American Indian tribal officials starting with the 1990 census), identified and delineated boundaries and names for CDPs. In the data products issued in conjunction with Census 2000, the name of each such place is followed by ``CDP,'' as was the case for the 1990 and 1980 censuses. In the data products issued in conjunction with the 1950, 1960, and 1970 censuses, these places were identified by ``(U),'' meaning ``unincorporated place.'' Hawaii is the only state that has no incorporated places recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau. All places shown in the data products for Hawaii are CDPs. By agreement with the state of Hawaii, the U.S. Census Bureau does not show data separately for the city of Honolulu, which is coextensive with Honolulu County. All places in the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam are CDPs. The Virgin Islands of the United States has both CDPs and incorporated places. There are no CDPs in American Samoa; the U.S. Census Bureau treats the traditional villages as statistically equivalent to incorporated places. Consolidated City A consolidated government is a unit of local government for which the functions of an incorporated place and its county or minor civil division (MCD) have merged. The legal aspects of this action may result in both the primary incorporated place and the county or MCD continuing to exist as legal entities, even though the county or MCD performs few or no governmental functions and has few or no elected officials. Where this occurs, and where one or more other incorporated places in the county or MCD continue to function as separate governments, even though they have been included in the consolidated government, the primary incorporated place is referred to as a consolidated city. The presentation of data for consolidated cities varies depending on the geographic presentation. In some hierarchical presentations, consolidated cities are not shown. These presentations include the places within the consolidated city and the ``consolidated city (balance).'' Although hierarchical presentations do not show the consolidated city, the data for it are the same as the county or county subdivision with which it is coextensive. Other hierarchical presentations do show the consolidated city, county or county subdivision, and (balance) as separate entities. A18 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   For inventory geographic presentations, the consolidated city appears alphabetically sequenced within the listing of places; in 1990, consolidated places appeared at the end of the listing. The data for the consolidated city include the data for all places that are part of and within the consolidated city. The ``consolidated city (balance)'' entry shows the data for the portion of the consolidated government minus the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city, and is shown in alphabetical sequence with other places that comprise the consolidated city. For data presentation purposes these ``balance'' entities are treated as statistically equivalent to a place; they have no legal basis or functions. In summary presentations by size of place, consolidated cities are categorized by their incorporated places are partially inside and by place will include all territory within the solidated city is only for part of the place. the consolidated city is not included. The places within size, as is the ``consolidated city (balance).'' A few partially outside a consolidated city. Data tabulations place, while the tabulation for the place within a con-  Each consolidated city is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code that is unique within state. The places within consolidated cities and the ``consolidated city (balance)'' also are assigned five-digit FIPS place codes that are unique within state. The code assigned to each place within a consolidated city is the same as its regular place code; a place that is partially included in a consolidated city does not have a different code for the portions inside and outside the consolidated city. FIPS codes are assigned based on alphabetical sequence within each state. Incorporated Place Incorporated places recognized in decennial census data products are those reported to the U.S. Census Bureau as legally in existence on January 1, 2000, under the laws of their respective states, as cities, boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, towns, and villages, with the following exceptions: the towns in the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin, and the boroughs in New York are recognized as minor civil divisions for decennial census purposes; the boroughs, city and boroughs (as in Juneau City and Borough), and municipality (Anchorage) in Alaska are county equivalents for decennial census statistical presentation purposes. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places known as ``independent cities'' that are primary divisions of a state and legally not part of any county. For data presentation purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau may treat an independent city as a county equivalent, county subdivision, and place. The U.S. Census Bureau treats the villages in American Samoa as incorporated places because they have their own officials, who have specific legal powers as authorized in the American Samoa Code. The village boundaries are traditional rather than being specific, legally defined locations. There are no incorporated places in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. The U.S. Census Bureau treats the three towns in the Virgin Islands of the United States as incorporated places. There are a few incorporated places that do not have a legal description. An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division, which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. POPULATION OR HOUSING UNIT DENSITY Population and housing unit density are computed by dividing the total population or number of housing units within a geographic entity (for example, United States, state, county, place) by the land area of that entity measured in square kilometers or square miles. Density is expressed as both ``people (or housing units) per square kilometer'' and ``people (or housing units) per square mile'' of land area. PUBLIC USE MICRODATA AREA (PUMA) A public use microdata area (PUMA) is a decennial census area for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides specially selected extracts of raw data from a small sample of long-form census records that are screened to protect confidentiality. These extracts are referred to as ``public use microdata sample (PUMS)'' files. Since 1960, data users have been using these files to create their own statistical tabulations and data summaries. Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A19   For Census 2000, state, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico participants, following U.S. Census Bureau criteria, delineated two types of PUMAs within their states. PUMAs of one type comprise areas that contain at least 100,000 people. The PUMS files for these PUMAs contain a 5-percent sample of the long-form records. The other type of PUMAs, super-PUMAs, comprise areas of at least 400,000 people. The sample size is 1 percent for the PUMS files for super-PUMAs. PUMAs cannot be in more than one state or statistically equivalent entity. The larger 1-percent PUMAs are aggregations of the smaller 5-percent PUMAs. PUERTO RICO The U.S. Census Bureau treats the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as the statistical equivalent of a state for data presentation purposes. Each state and statistically equivalent entity is assigned a two-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order by state name, followed in alphabetical order by Puerto Rico and the Island Areas. Each state and statistically equivalent entity also is assigned the two-letter FIPS/U.S. Postal Service code. Municipio The primary legal divisions of Puerto Rico are termed ``municipios.'' For data presentation purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau treats a municipio as the equivalent of a county in the United States. Each municipio is assigned a unique three-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within Puerto Rico. Barrio, Barrio-Pueblo, and Subbarrio The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes barrios and barrios-pueblo as the primary legal divisions of municipios. These entities are similar to the minor civil divisions (MCDs) used for reporting decennial census data in 28 states of the United States. Subbarrios in 23 municipios are the primary legal subdivisions of the barrios-pueblo and some barrios. The U.S. Census Bureau presents the same types of Census 2000 data for these ``sub-MCDs'' as it does for the barrios and barriospueblo. (There is no geographic entity in the United States equivalent to the subbarrio.) Each barrio, barrio-pueblo, and subbarrio is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within Puerto Rico. Zona Urbana and Comunidad There are no incorporated places in Puerto Rico; instead, the U.S. Census Bureau provides decennial census data for two types of census designated places (CDPs): (1) zonas urbanas, representing the governmental center of each municipio, and (2) comunidades, representing other settlements. For Census 2000, there are no minimum population size requirements for CDPs. (For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau had required comunidades to have at least 1,000 people.) Each zona urbana and comunidad is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within Puerto Rico. Some types of geographic entities do not apply in Puerto Rico. For instance, Puerto Rico is not in any census region or census division. In addition, the U.S. Census Bureau does not tabulate data for state legislative districts and traffic analysis zones in Puerto Rico. (See also CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT (CD).) SCHOOL DISTRICT School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials or the Department of Defense provide public educational services for the areas residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in conjunction with the 1970 census. For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified. A20 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name. STATE (OR STATISTICALLY EQUIVALENT ENTITY) States are the primary governmental divisions of the United States. The District of Columbia is treated as a statistical equivalent of a state for data presentation purposes. For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau also treats a number of entities that are not legal divisions of the United States as statistically equivalent to a state: American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Each state and statistically equivalent entity is assigned a two-digit numeric Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order by state name, followed in alphabetical order by Puerto Rico and the Island Areas. Each state and statistically equivalent entity also is assigned a two-letter FIPS/U.S. Postal Service code and a two-digit census code. The census code is assigned on the basis of the geographic sequence of each state within each census division; the first digit of the code identifies the respective division, except for Puerto Rico and the Island Areas, which are not assigned to any region or division. The census regions, census divisions, and their component states are listed in Figure A3. STATE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT (SLD) State legislative districts (SLDs) are the areas from which members are elected to state legislatures. The SLDs embody the upper (senate) and lower (house) chambers of the state legislature. (Nebraska has a unicameral legislature that the U.S. Census Bureau treats as an upper-chamber legislative area for data presentation purposes. There are, therefore, no data by lower chamber.) A unique census code of up to three characters, identified by state participants, is assigned to each SLD within state. The code ``ZZZ'' identifies parts of a county in which no SLDs were identified. As an option in the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program (Public Law 94-171), participating states receive P.L. 94-171 census data for their SLDs (see VOTING DISTRICT (VTD)). Not all states delineated SLDs for the purpose of presenting Census 2000 data, in which case the entire state is treated as a single SLD coded with blanks at both levels. TIGER DATABASE TIGER is an acronym for the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (System or database). It is a digital (computer-readable) geographic database that automates the mapping and related geographic activities required to support the U.S. Census Bureau's census and survey programs. The U.S. Census Bureau developed the TIGER System to automate the geographic support processes needed to meet the major geographic needs of the 1990 census: producing the cartographic products to support data collection and map presentations, providing the geographic structure for tabulation and dissemination of the collected statistical data, assigning residential and employer addresses to the correct geographic location and relating those locations to the geographic entities used for data tabulation, and so forth. The content of the TIGER database is undergoing continuous updates and is made available to the public through a variety of TIGER/Line files that may be obtained free of charge from the Internet or packaged on CD-ROM or DVD from Customer Services, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-1900; telephone 301-763-INFO (4636); Internet http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger. TRAFFIC ANALYSIS ZONE (TAZ) A traffic analysis zone (TAZ) is a statistical entity delineated by state and/or local transportation officials for tabulating traffic-related census dataespecially journey-to-work and place-of-work statistics. A TAZ usually consists of one or more census blocks, block groups, or census tracts. For the 1990 census, TAZs were defined as part of the Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP). The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for TAZs in conjunction with the 1980 census, when it identified them as ``traffic zones.'' Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A21   Each TAZ is identified by a six-character alphanumeric code that is unique within county or statistically equivalent entity. For the 1990 census, TAZ codes were unique within CTPP area, which generally conformed to a metropolitan area. TRIBAL BLOCK GROUP A tribal block group (BG) is a cluster of census blocks having the same first digit of their four-digit identifying numbers and are within a single tribal census tract. For example, tribal BG 3 consists of all blocks within tribal tract 9406 numbered from 3000 to 3999. Where a federally recognized American Indian reservation and/or off-reservation trust land crosses county and/or state lines, the same tribal BG may be assigned on both sides of the state/county boundary within a tribal census tract that is numbered from 9400 to 9499. The optimum size for a tribal BG is 1,000 people; it must contain a minimum of 300 people. (See also BLOCK GROUP (BG).) The difference between a tribal BG and a nontribal BG is in the hierarchical presentation of the data. A tribal BG is part of the American Indian hierarchy; that is, the tribal BG is within a tribal census tract that is within a federally recognized American Indian reservation and/or offreservation trust land. (See INTRODUCTION--GEOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF DATA.) TRIBAL CENSUS TRACT Tribal census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a federally recognized American Indian reservation and/or off-reservation trust land. The optimum size for a tribal census tract is 2,500 people; it must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. Where a federally recognized American Indian reservation or off-reservation trust land crosses county or state lines, the same tribal census tract number may be assigned on both sides of the state/county boundary. The U.S. Census Bureau uses the census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for tribal census tracts that cross state/county boundaries and are within or encompassing American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land. (See also CENSUS TRACT.) The difference between a tribal census tract and a nontribal census tract is in the hierarchical presentation of the data. A tribal census tract is part of the American Indian hierarchy; that is, the tribal census tract is within a federally recognized American Indian reservation and/or offreservation trust land. (See INTRODUCTION--GEOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF DATA.) UNITED STATES The United States consists of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. URBAN AND RURAL The U.S. Census Bureau classifies as urban all territory, population, and housing units located within urbanized areas (UAs) and urban clusters (UCs). It delineates UA and UC boundaries to encompass densely settled territory, which generally consists of:  A cluster of one or more block groups or census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile at the time.  Surrounding block groups and census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 500 people per square mile at the time.  Less densely settled blocks that form enclaves or indentations, or are used to connect discontiguous areas with qualifying densities. Rural consists of all territory, population, and housing units located outside of UAs and UCs. Geographic entities, such as metropolitan areas, counties, minor civil divisions, and places, often contain both urban and rural territory, population, and housing units. This urban and rural classification applies to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. A22 Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Urbanized Area (UA) An urbanized area (UA) consists of densely settled territory that contains 50,000 or more people. The U.S. Census Bureau delineates UAs to provide a better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and housing in the vicinity of large places. For Census 2000, the UA criteria were extensively revised and the delineations were performed using a zero-based approach. Because of more stringent density requirements, some territory that was classified as urbanized for the 1990 census has been reclassified as rural. (Area that was part of a 1990 UA has not been automatically grandfathered into the 2000 UA.) In addition, some areas that were identified as UAs for the 1990 census have been reclassified as urban clusters. Urban Cluster (UC) An urban cluster (UC) consists of densely settled territory that has at least 2,500 people but fewer than 50,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau introduced the UC for Census 2000 to provide a more consistent and accurate measure of the population concentration in and around places. UCs are defined using the same criteria that are used to define UAs. UCs replace the provision in the 1990 and previous censuses that defined as urban only those places with 2,500 or more people located outside of urbanized areas. Urban Area Title and Code The title of each urbanized area (UA) and urban cluster (UC) may contain up to three incorporated place names, and will include the two-letter U.S. Postal Service abbreviation for each state into which the UA or UC extends. However, if the UA or UC does not contain an incorporated place, the urban area title will include the single name of a census designated place, minor civil division, or populated place recognized by the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System. Each UA and UC is assigned a five-digit numeric code, based on a national alphabetical sequence of all urban area names. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned a four-digit UA code based on the metropolitan area codes. A separate flag is included in data tabulation files to differentiate between UAs and UCs. In printed reports, this differentiation is included in the name. Urban Area Central Place A central place functions as the dominant center of an urban area. The U.S. Census Bureau identifies one or more central places for each urbanized area (UA) or urban cluster (UC) that contains a place. Any incorporated place or census designated place (CDP) that is in the title of the urban area is a central place of that UA or UC. In addition, any other incorporated place or CDP that has an urban population of 50,000 or an urban population of at least 2,500 people and is at least 2/3 the size of the largest place within the urban area also is a central place. Extended Place As a result of the urbanized area (UA) and urban cluster (UC) delineations, an incorporated place or census designated place may be partially within and partially outside of a UA or UC. Any place that is split by a UA or UC is referred to as an extended place. Documentation of the UA, UC, and extended place criteria is available from the Geographic Areas Branch, Geography Division, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-7400; telephone 301-457-1099. URBAN GROWTH AREA (UGA) An urban growth area (UGA) is a legally defined geographic entity in Oregon that the U.S. Census Bureau includes in the TIGER database in agreement with the state. UGAs, which are defined around incorporated places, are used to control urban growth. UGA boundaries, which need not follow visible features, are delineated cooperatively by state and local officials and then confirmed in state law. UGAs are a new geographic entity for Census 2000. Geographic Terms and Concepts U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  A23   Each UGA is identified by a five-digit census code, which generally is the same as the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for the incorporated place for which the UGA is named. The codes are assigned alphabetically within Oregon. VOTING DISTRICT (VTD) Voting district (VTD) is the generic name for geographic entities, such as precincts, wards, and election districts, established by state, local, and tribal governments for the purpose of conducting elections. States participating in the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) may provide boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs to the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for VTDs following the 1980 census. Because the U.S. Census Bureau requires that VTDs follow boundaries of census blocks, participating states often adjusted the boundaries of the VTDs they submit to conform to census block boundaries for data presentation purposes. If requested by the participating state, the U.S. Census Bureau identifies the VTDs that have not been adjusted as an ``A'' for actual in the VTD indicator field of the PL data file. The VTD indicator for all other VTDs is shown as ``P'' for pseudo. For Census 2000, each VTD is identified by a one- to six-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county. The code ``ZZZZZZ'' identifies parts of a county in which no VTDs were identified. For a state or county that did not participate in the VTD project, the code fields are blank. ZIP CODE TABULATION AREA (ZCTATM) A ZIP Code tabulation area (ZCTATM) is a statistical geographic entity that approximates the delivery area for a U.S. Postal Service five-digit or three-digit ZIP Code. ZCTAs are aggregations of census blocks that have the same predominant ZIP Code associated with the residential mailing addresses in the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File. Three-digit ZCTA codes are applied to large contiguous areas for which the U.S. Census Bureau does not have five-digit ZIP Code information in its Master Address File. ZCTAs do not precisely depict ZIP Code delivery areas, and do not include all ZIP Codes used for mail delivery. The U.S. Census Bureau has established ZCTAs as a new geographic entity similar to, but replacing, data tabulations for ZIP Codes undertaken in conjunction with the 1990 and earlier censuses.

Puerto Rico: Please note that States and Puerto Rico, except comparability refer only to the documentation for Puerto Rico censuses. AGE The data on age, which was asked of all people, were derived from answers to the long-form questionnaire Item 4 and short-form questionnaire Item 6. The age classification is based on the age of the person in complete years as of April 1, 2000. The age of the person usually was derived from their date of birth information. Their reported age was used only when date of birth information was unavailable. Data on age are used to determine the applicability of some of the sample questions for a person and to classify other characteristics in census tabulations. Age data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and examine many programs and policies. Therefore, age is tabulated by single years of age and by many different groupings, such as 5-year age groups. Median age. Median age divides the age distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median age and one-half above the median. Median age is computed on the basis of a single year of age standard distribution (see the ``Standard Distributions'' section under ``Derived Measures''). Median age is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on medians, see ``Derived Measures.'') Limitation of the data. The most general limitation for many decades has been the tendency of people to overreport ages or years of birth that end in zero or 5. This phenomenon is called ``age heaping.'' In addition, the counts in the 1970 and 1980 censuses for people 100 years old and over were substantially overstated. So also were the counts of people 69 years old in 1970 and 79 years old in 1980. Improvements have been made since then in the questionnaire design and in the imputation procedures that have minimized these problems. Review of detailed 1990 census information indicated that respondents tended to provide their age as of the date of completion of the questionnaire, not their age as of April 1, 1990. One reason this happened was that respondents were not specifically instructed to provide their age as of April 1, 1990. Another reason was that data collection efforts continued well past the census date. In addition, there may have been a tendency for respondents to round their age up if they were close to having a birthday. It is likely that approximately 10 percent of people in most age groups were actually 1 year younger. For most single years of age, the misstatements were largely offsetting. The problem is most pronounced at age zero because people lost to age 1 probably were not fully offset by the inclusion of babies born after April 1, 1990. Also, there may have been more rounding up to age 1 to avoid reporting age as zero years. (Age in complete months was not collected for infants under age 1.) B4 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B70 B77 B77 B77 B77 B69 B69 B70  for Census 2000, the definitions below apply to both the United where noted. For 1990 and earlier censuses, references on United States. Please refer to the appropriate technical for comparability statements pertaining to 1990 and earlier   The reporting of age 1 year older than true age on April 1, 1990, is likely to have been greater in areas where the census data were collected later in calendar year 1990. The magnitude of this problem was much less in the 1960, 1970, and 1980 censuses where age was typically derived from respondent data on year of birth and quarter of birth. These shortcomings were minimized in Census 2000 because age was usually calculated from exact date of birth and because respondents were specifically asked to provide their age as of April 1, 2000. (For more information on the design of the age question, see the section below that discusses ``Comparability.'') Comparability. Age data have been collected in every census. For the first time since 1950, the 1990 data were not available by quarter year of age. This change was made so that coded information could be obtained for both age and year of birth. In 2000, each individual has both an age and an exact date of birth. In each census since 1940, the age of a person was assigned when it was not reported. In censuses before 1940, with the exception of 1880, people of unknown age were shown as a separate category. Since 1960, assignment of unknown age has been performed by a general procedure described as ``imputation.'' The specific procedures for imputing age have been different in each census. (For more information on imputation, see ``Accuracy of the Data.'') ANCESTRY The data on ancestry were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 10, which was asked of a sample of the population. The data represent self-classification by people according to the ancestry group or groups with which they most closely identify. Ancestry refers to a person's ethnic origin or descent, ``roots,'' heritage, or the place of birth of the person, the person's parents, or their ancestors before their arrival in the United States. Some ethnic identities, such as Egyptian or Polish, can be traced to geographic areas outside the United States, while other ethnicities, such as Pennsylvania German or Cajun, evolved in the United States. The intent of the ancestry question was not to measure the degree of attachment the respondent had to a particular ethnicity. For example, a response of ``Irish'' might reflect total involvement in an Irish community or only a memory of ancestors several generations removed from the individual. Also, the question was intended to provide data for groups that were not included in the Hispanic origin and race questions. Official Hispanic origin data come from long-form questionnaire Item 5, and official race data come from long-form questionnaire Item 6. Therefore, although data on all groups are collected, the ancestry data shown in these tabulations are for non-Hispanic and nonrace groups. Hispanic and race groups are included in the ``Other groups'' category for the ancestry tables in these tabulations. The ancestry question allowed respondents to report one or more ancestry groups, although only the first two were coded. If a response was in terms of a dual ancestry, for example, ``Irish English,'' the person was assigned two codes, in this case one for Irish and another for English. However, in certain cases, multiple responses such as ``French Canadian,'' ``Greek Cypriote,'' and ``Scotch Irish'' were assigned a single code reflecting their status as unique groups. If a person reported one of these unique groups in addition to another group, for example, ``Scotch Irish English,'' resulting in three terms, that person received one code for the unique group (Scotch-Irish) and another one for the remaining group (English). If a person reported ``English Irish French,'' only English and Irish were coded. Certain combinations of ancestries where the ancestry group is a part of another, such as ``German-Bavarian,'' were coded as a single ancestry using the more specific group (Bavarian). Also, responses such as ``Polish-American'' or ``Italian-American'' were coded and tabulated as a single entry (Polish or Italian). The Census Bureau accepted ``American'' as a unique ethnicity if it was given alone, with an ambiguous response, or with state names. If the respondent listed any other ethnic identity such as ``Italian-American,'' generally the ``American'' portion of the response was not coded. However, distinct groups such as ``American Indian,'' ``Mexican American,'' and ``African American'' were coded and identified separately because they represented groups who considered themselves different from those who reported as ``Indian,'' ``Mexican,'' or ``African,'' respectively. Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B5   In all tabulations, when respondents provided an unclassifiable ethnic identity (for example, ``multinational,'' ``adopted,'' or ``I have no idea''), the answer was included in tabulation category ``Unclassified or not reported.'' The tabulations on ancestry are presented using two types of data presentations--one using total people as the base, and the other using total responses as the base. The following are categories shown in the two data presentations. Presentation Based on People Single ancestries reported -- Includes all people who reported only one ancestry group. Included in this category are people with multiple-term responses such as ``Greek Cypriote'' who are assigned a single code. Multiple ancestries reported -- Includes all people who reported more than one group and were assigned two ancestry codes. Ancestry unclassified -- Includes all people who provided a response that could not be assigned an ancestry code because they provided unclear entries or entries that represent religious groups. Presentation Based on Responses First ancestry reported -- Includes the first response of all people who reported at least one codeable entry. For example, in this category, the count for Danish would include all those who reported only Danish and those who reported Danish first and then some other group. Second ancestry reported -- Includes the second response of all people who reported a multiple ancestry. Thus, the count for Danish in this category includes all people who reported Danish as the second response, regardless of the first response provided. Total ancestries reported or total ancestries tallied -- Includes the total number of ancestries reported and coded. If a person reported a multiple ancestry such as ``French Danish,'' that response was counted twice in the tabulations once in the French category and again in the Danish category. Thus, the sum of the counts in this type of presentation is not the total population but the total of all responses. An automated coding system was used for coding ancestry in Census 2000. This greatly reduced the potential for error associated with a clerical review. Specialists with knowledge of the subject matter reviewed, edited, coded, and resolved inconsistent or incomplete responses. The code list used in Census 2000, containing over 1,000 categories, reflects the results of the Census Bureau's experience with the 1990 ancestry question, research, and consultation with many ethnic experts. Many decisions were made to determine the classification of responses. These decisions affected the grouping of the tabulated data. For example, the Italian category includes the responses of Sicilian and Tuscan, as well as a number of other responses. Limitation of the data. Although some people consider religious affiliation a component of ethnic identity, the ancestry question was not designed to collect any information concerning religion. Thus, if a religion was given as an answer to the ancestry question, it was listed in the ``Other groups'' category. Ancestry should not be confused with a person's place of birth, although a person's place of birth and ancestry may be the same (see ``Place of Birth''). The ancestry data in these tabulations are limited to groups that were not shown in the Hispanic origin and race tabulations. For example, since Mexican is shown in the Hispanic origin tables, it is not shown in the ancestry tables. Likewise, since Korean is shown in the race tables, it is not shown in the ancestry tables. Hispanic and race groups are included in the ``Other groups'' category for the ancestry tables in these tabulations. Unlike other census questions, there was no imputation for nonresponse to the ancestry question. B6 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Comparability. The ancestry question was first introduced in 1980 as ``What is this person's ancestry?'' In 1990, the question was changed to ``What is this person's ancestry or ethnic origin?'' to improve understanding and response. This question was used again in Census 2000. The ancestry groups used as examples have changed over time. The changes were introduced to avoid or to minimize example-induced responses, and to ensure broad geographic and group coverage. CITIZENSHIP STATUS The data on citizenship were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 13, which was asked of a sample of the population. On the stateside questionnaire, respondents were asked to select one of five categories: (1) born in the United States, (2) born in Puerto Rico or a U.S. Island Area (such as Guam), (3) born abroad of American parent(s), (4) naturalized citizen, (5) not a citizen. On the Puerto Rico questionnaire, respondents were asked to select one of five categories: (1) born in Puerto Rico, (2) born in a U.S. state, District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Mariana Islands, (3) born abroad of American parent or parent(s), (4) U.S. citizen by naturalization, (5) not a citizen of the United States. People not reporting citizenship were assigned citizenship based on a set of criteria including the citizenship status of other household members and place of birth. (See ``Place of Birth.'') Citizen. This category includes respondents who indicated that they were born in the United States, Puerto Rico, a U.S. Island Area, or abroad of American parent or parents. People who indicated that they were U.S. citizens through naturalization are also citizens. Not a citizen. This category includes respondents who indicated that they were not U.S. citizens. Native. The native population includes people born in the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Island Areas (such as Guam). People who were born in a foreign country but have at least one American (U.S. citizen) parent also are included in this category. The native population includes anyone who was a U.S. citizen at birth. Foreign born. The foreign-born population includes all people who were not U.S. citizens at birth. Foreign-born people are those who indicated they were either a U.S. citizen by naturalization or they were not a citizen of the United States. Census 2000 does not ask about immigration status. The population surveyed includes all people who indicated that the United States was their usual place of residence on the census date. The foreign-born population includes: immigrants (legal permanent residents), temporary migrants (e.g., students), humanitarian migrants (e.g., refugees), and unauthorized migrants (people illegally residing in the United States). The foreign-born population is shown by selected area, country, or region of birth. The places of birth shown in data products were chosen based on the number of respondents who reported that area or country of birth. (See ``Place of Birth.'') Comparability. The citizenship status questions for the 2000 decennial census and the 1990 decennial census are identical. DISABILITY STATUS The data on disability status were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Items 16 and 17. Item 16 was a two-part question that asked about the existence of the following long-lasting conditions: (a) blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment (sensory disability) and (b) a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying (physical disability). Item 16 was asked of a sample of the population 5 years old and over. Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B7   Item 17 was a four-part question that asked if the individual had a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting 6 months or more that made it difficult to perform certain activities. The four activity categories were: (a) learning, remembering, or concentrating (mental disability); (b) dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home (self-care disability); (c) going outside the home alone to shop or visit a doctor's office (going outside the home disability); and (d) working at a job or business (employment disability). Categories 17a and 17b were asked of a sample of the population 5 years old and over; 17c and 17d were asked of a sample of the population 16 years old and over. For data products that use the items individually, the following terms are used: sensory disability for 16a, physical disability for 16b, mental disability for 17a, self-care disability for 17b, going outside the home disability for 17c, and employment disability for 17d. For data products that use a disability status indicator, individuals were classified as having a disability if any of the following three conditions were true: (1) they were 5 years old and over and had a response of ``yes'' to a sensory, physical, mental or self-care disability; (2) they were 16 years old and over and had a response of ``yes'' to going outside the home disability; or (3) they were 16 to 64 years old and had a response of ``yes'' to employment disability. Comparability. The 1990 census data products did not include a general disability status indicator. Furthermore, a comparable indicator could not be constructed since the conceptual framework of the 1990 census was more limited. The questionnaire included only three types of disability in questions with four subparts. The questions asked about whether an individual had a condition that had lasted for 6 months or more and that (1) limited the kind or amount of work that he or she could do at a job, (2) prevented the individual from working at a job, (3) made it difficult to go outside the home alone (for example, to shop or visit a doctor's office), and (4) made it difficult to take care of his or her own personal needs, such as bathing, dressing, or getting around inside the home. The 1990 disability questions were asked on the long form questionnaire of the population 15 years old and over. EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT Data on educational attainment were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 9, which was asked of a sample of the population. Data on attainment are tabulated for the population 25 years old and over. However, when educational attainment is cross-tabulated by other variables, the universe may change. (For example, when educational attainment is crossed by disability status, the data are tabulated for the civilian noninstitutionalized population 18 to 34 years old.) People are classified according to the highest degree or level of school completed. The order in which degrees were listed on the questionnaire suggested that doctorate degrees were ``higher'' than professional school degrees, which were ``higher'' than master's degrees. The question included instructions for people currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received. Respondents who did not report educational attainment or enrollment level were assigned the attainment of a person of the same age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, occupation and sex, where possible, who resided in the same or a nearby area. Respondents who filled more than one box were edited to the highest level or degree reported. The question included a response category that allowed respondents to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. It allowed people who received either a high school diploma or the equivalent, for example, passed the Test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.) and did not attend college, to be reported as ``high school graduate(s).'' The category ``Associate degree'' included people whose highest degree is an associate degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor's degree. Master's degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Some examples of professional degrees include medicine, dentistry, B8 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. Vocational and technical training, such as barber school training; business, trade, technical, and vocational schools; or other training for a specific trade, are specifically excluded. High school graduate or higher. This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received a college, university, or professional degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not high school graduates. Not enrolled, not high school graduate. This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as ``high school dropouts.'' However, there is no criterion regarding when they ``dropped out'' of school, so they may have never attended high school. Comparability. From 1840 to 1930, the census measured educational attainment by means of a basic literacy question. In 1940, a single question was asked on highest grade of school completed. In the 1950 to 1980 censuses, a two-part question was used to construct highest grade or year of school completed. The question asked (1) the highest grade of school attended and (2) whether that grade was finished. For people who have not attended college, the response categories in the current educational attainment question should produce data that are comparable to data on highest grade completed from earlier censuses. For people who attended college, there is less comparability between years of school completed and highest degree. Beginning in 1990, the response categories for people who have attended college were modified from earlier censuses because there was some ambiguity in interpreting responses in terms of the number of years of college completed. For instance, it was not clear whether ``completed the fourth year of college,'' ``completed the senior year of college,'' and ``college graduate'' were synonymous. Research conducted shortly before the 1990 census suggests that these terms were more distinct than in earlier decades, and this change may have threatened the ability to estimate the number of ``college graduates'' from the number of people reported as having completed the fourth or a higher year of college. It was even more difficult to make inferences about post-baccalaureate degrees and ``Associate'' degrees from highest year of college completed. Thus, comparisons of post-secondary educational attainment in the 2000 and 1990 censuses with data from the earlier censuses should be made with great caution. Changes between 1990 and Census 2000 were slight. The two associate degree categories in 1990 were combined into one for Census 2000. ``Some college, no degree'' was split into two categories, ``Some college credit, but less than 1 year,'' and ``1 or more years of college, no degree.'' Prior to 1990, the college levels reported began with ``Completed 1 year of college.'' Beginning in 1990, the first category was ``Some college, no degree,'' which allowed people with less than 1 year of college to be given credit for college. Prior to 1990, they were included in ``High school, 4 years.'' The two revised categories will accommodate comparisons with either data series and allow the tabulation of students who completed at least 1 year of college, as some data users wish. This will not change the total number who completed some college. The category ``12th grade, no diploma'' was counted as high school completion or ``Completed high school, 4 years'' prior to 1990 and as ``Less than high school graduate'' in 1990 and 2000. In the 1960 and subsequent censuses, people for whom educational attainment was not reported were assigned the same attainment level as a similar person whose residence was in the same or a nearby area. In the 1940 and 1950 censuses, people for whom educational attainment was not reported were not allocated. In censuses prior to 1990, ``median school years completed'' was used as a summary measure of educational attainment. Using the current educational attainment question, the median can only be calculated for groups of which less than half the members have attended college. ``Percent high school graduate or higher'' and ``percent bachelor's degree or higher'' are summary measures that can be calculated from the present data and offer quite readily interpretable measures of differences between population subgroups. Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B9   EMPLOYMENT STATUS The data on employment status (referred to as labor force status in previous censuses), were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Items 21and 25, which were asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. The series of questions on employment status was designed to identify, in this sequence: (1) people who worked at any time during the reference week; (2) people who did not work during the reference week, but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent (excluding people on layoff); (3) people on temporary layoff who expected to be recalled to work within the next 6 months or who had been given a date to return to work, and who were available for work during the reference week; and (4) people who did not work during the reference week, who had looked for work during the reference week or the three previous weeks, and who were available for work during the reference week. (For more information, see ``Reference Week.'') The employment status data shown in Census 2000 tabulations relate to people 16 years old and over. In the 1940, 1950, and 1960 censuses, employment status data were presented for people 14 years old and over. The change in the universe was made in 1970 to agree with the official measurement of the labor force as revised in January 1967 by the U.S. Department of Labor. The 1970 census was the last to show employment data for people 14 and 15 years old. Employed. All civilians 16 years old and over who were either (1) ``at work''-- those who did any work at all during the reference week as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession, worked on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a family farm or in a family business; or (2) were ``with a job but not at work''-- those who did not work during the reference week, but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent because of illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons. Excluded from the employed are people whose only activity consisted of work around their own house (painting, repairing, or own home housework) or unpaid volunteer work for religious, charitable, and similar organizations. Also excluded are all institutionalized people and people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces. Civilian employed. This term is defined exactly the same as the term ``employed'' above. Unemployed. All civilians 16 years old and over were classified as unemployed if they were neither ``at work'' nor ``with a job but not at work'' during the reference week, were looking for work during the last 4 weeks, and were available to start a job. Also included as unemployed were civilians 16 years old and over who: did not work at all during the reference week, were on temporary layoff from a job, had been informed that they would be recalled to work within the next 6 months or had been given a date to return to work, and were available to return to work during the reference week, except for temporary illness. Examples of job seeking activities were:  Registering at a public or private employment office  Meeting with prospective employers  Investigating possibilities for starting a professional practice or opening a business  Placing or answering advertisements  Writing letters of application  Being on a union or professional register Civilian labor force. Consists of people classified as employed or unemployed in accordance with the criteria described above. Labor force. All people classified in the civilian labor force (i.e., ``employed'' and ``unemployed'' people), plus members of the U.S. Armed Forces (people on active duty with the United States Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard). B10 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Not in labor force. All people 16 years old and over who are not classified as members of the labor force. This category consists mainly of students, individuals taking care of home or family, retired workers, seasonal workers enumerated in an off-season who were not looking for work, institutionalized people (all institutionalized people are placed in this category regardless of any work activities they may have done in the reference week), and people doing only incidental unpaid family work (fewer than 15 hours during the reference week). Worker. The terms ``worker'' and ``work'' appear in connection with several subjects: employment status, journey-to-work, class of worker, and work status in 1999. Their meaning varies and, therefore, should be determined by referring to the definition of the subject in which they appear. When used in the concepts ``Workers in Family,'' ``Workers in Family in 1999,'' and ``Full-Time, Year-Round Workers,'' the term ``worker'' relates to the meaning of work defined for the ``Work Status in 1999'' subject. Full-time, year-round workers. See ``Work status in 1999.'' Limitation of the data. The census may understate the number of employed people because people who have irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs sometimes report themselves as not working. The number of employed people ``at work'' is probably overstated in the census (and conversely, the number of employed ``with a job, but not at work'' is understated) since some people who were on vacation or sick leave erroneously reported themselves as working. This problem has no effect on the total number of employed people. The reference week for the employment data is not the same calendar week for all people. Since people can change their employment status from 1 week to another, the lack of a uniform reference week may mean that the employment data do not reflect the reality of the employment situation of any given week. (For more information, see ``Reference Week.'') Note: The Census Bureau is aware there may be a problem or problems in the employment-status data of Census 2000 Summary File 3 (including tables P38, P43-P46, P149A-I, P150A-I, PCT35, PCT69A-I, and PCT70A-I). The labor force data for some places where colleges are located appear to overstate the number in the labor force, the number unemployed, and the percent unemployed, probably because of reporting or processing error. The exact cause is unknown, but the Census Bureau will continue to research the problem. Comparability. The questionnaire items and employment status concepts for Census 2000 are essentially the same as those used in the 1970 to 1990 censuses. However, these concepts differ in many respects from those associated with the 1950 and 1960 censuses. Since employment data from the census are obtained from respondents in households, they differ from statistics based on reports from individual business establishments, farm enterprises, and certain government programs. People employed at more than one job are counted only once in the census and are classified according to the job at which they worked the greatest number of hours during the reference week. In statistics based on reports from business and farm establishments, people who work for more than one establishment may be counted more than once. Moreover, some establishment-based tabulations may exclude private household workers, unpaid family workers, and self-employed people, but may include workers less than 16 years old. Census tabulations count people who had a job but were not at work among the employed, but these people may be excluded from employment figures based on establishment payroll reports. Furthermore, census employment tabulations include people on the basis of place of residence regardless of where they work; whereas, establishment data report people at their place of work regardless of where they live. This latter consideration is particularly significant when comparing data for workers who commute between areas. For several reasons, the unemployment figures of the Census Bureau are not comparable with published figures on unemployment compensation claims. For example, figures on unemployment compensation claims exclude people who have exhausted their benefit rights, new workers who have not earned rights to unemployment insurance, and people losing jobs not covered by unemployment insurance systems (including some workers in agriculture, domestic services, and religious organizations, and self-employed and unpaid family workers). In addition, the qualifications for drawing unemployment compensation differ from the definition of unemployment used by the Census Bureau. People working only a few hours during the week and people with a job, but not at work are sometimes eligible for unemployment compensation but are classified as ``employed'' in the census. Differences in the geographical distribution of unemployment data arise because the place where claims are filed may not necessarily be the same as the place of residence of the unemployed worker. Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B11   The figures on employment status from the decennial census are generally comparable with similar data collected in the Current Population Survey, which is the official source of the monthly national unemployment rate. However, some differences may exist because of variations between the two data sources in enumeration and processing techniques. GRADE IN WHICH ENROLLED The data on grade or level in which enrolled were derived from long-form questionnaire Item 8b, which was asked of a sample of the population. People who were enrolled in school were classified as enrolled in ``Nursery school, preschool,'' ``Kindergarten,'' ``Grade 1 to 4'' or ``Grade 5 to 8,'' ``Grade 9 to 12,'' ``College undergraduate years (freshman to senior)'' or ``Graduate and professional school (for example: medical, dental, or law school).'' Comparability. Grade of enrollment was first available in the 1940 census, where it was obtained from responses to the question on highest grade of school completed. Enumerators were instructed that ``for a person still in school, the last grade completed will be the grade preceding the one in which he or she was now enrolled.'' From 1950 to 1980, grade of enrollment was obtained from the highest grade attended in the two-part question used to measure educational attainment. (For more information, see the discussion under ``Educational Attainment.'') The form of the question from which level of enrollment was derived in the 1990 census most closely corresponds to the question used in 1940. While data from prior censuses can be aggregated to provide levels of enrollment comparable to the 1990 census and Census 2000, the data from these sources cannot be disaggregated to show single grade of enrollment as in previous censuses. In the 1990 census, people who were enrolled in school were classified as enrolled in ``preprimary school,'' ``elementary or high school,'' or ``college,'' according to their response to long-form questionnaire Item 12 (years of school completed or highest degree received). Those who were enrolled and reported completing nursery school or less were classified as enrolled in ``preprimary school,'' which includes kindergarten. Similarly, those enrolled who had completed at least kindergarten, but not high school, were classified as enrolled in elementary or high school. The enrolled who also reported completing high school or some college or having received a post-secondary degree were classified as enrolled in ``college.'' Those who reported completing the twelfth grade but receiving ``NO DIPLOMA'' were classified as enrolled in high school. The Census 2000 question is the first to be asked measure both year of enrollment and educational served the needs for educational attainment data censuses, it did not serve reporting of enrollment GRANDPARENTS AS CAREGIVERS The data on grandparents as caregivers were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 19, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. Data were collected on whether a grandchild lives in the household, whether the grandparent has responsibility for the basic needs of the grandchild, and the duration of that responsibility. Because of the very low number of people under 30 years old who are grandparents, data are only shown for people 30 years old and over. Existence of a grandchild in the household. This was determined by a ``Yes'' answer to the sample question, ``Does this person have any of his/her own grandchildren under the age of 18 living in this house or apartment?'' Responsibility for basic needs. This question determines if the grandparent is financially responsible for food, shelter, clothing, day care, etc., for any or all grandchildren living in the household. Duration of responsibility. The answer refers to the grandchild for whom the grandparent has been responsible for the longest period of time. Duration categories ranged from less than 6 months to 5 years or more. B12 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  only of the enrolled and does not serve to attainment. While the attainment item in 1990 better than the question used in earlier level well.   Comparability. These questions are new to Census 2000. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 mandated that the decennial census collect data on this subject. GROUP QUARTERS The group quarters population includes all people not living in households. Two general categories of people in group quarters are recognized: (1) the institutionalized population and (2) the noninstitutionalized population. Institutionalized population. The institutionalized population includes people under formally authorized, supervised care or custody in institutions at the time of enumeration; such as correctional institutions, nursing homes, and juvenile institutions. Noninstitutionalized population. The noninstitutionalized population includes all people who live in group quarters other than institutions, such as college dormitories, military quarters, and group homes. Also, included are staff residing at institutional group quarters. For a complete description of the types of group quarters included in Census 2000, see the Technical Documentation for Summary File 1, 2000 Census of Population and Housing, at http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf1.pdf. HISPANIC OR LATINO The data on the Hispanic or Latino population, which was asked of all people, were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 5, and short-form questionnaire Item 7. The terms ``Spanish,'' ``Hispanic origin,'' and ``Latino'' are used interchangeably. Some respondents identify with all three terms, while others may identify with only one of these three specific terms. Hispanics or Latinos who identify with the terms ``Spanish,'' ``Hispanic,'' or ``Latino'' are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the questionnaire -- ``Mexican,'' ``Puerto Rican,'' or ``Cuban'' -- as well as those who indicate that they are ``other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino.'' People who do not identify with one of the specific origins listed on the questionnaire but indicate that they are ``other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino'' are those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people identifying themselves generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on. All write-in responses to the ``other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino'' category were coded. Origin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino may be of any race. Some tabulations are shown by the origin of the householder. In all cases where the origin of households, families, or occupied housing units is classified as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino, the origin of the householder is used. (For more information, see the discussion of householder under ``Household Type and Relationship.'') If an individual could not provide a Hispanic origin response, their origin was assigned using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if origin was missing for a natural-born daughter in the household, then either the origin of the householder, another natural-born child, or the spouse of the householder was assigned. If Hispanic origin was not reported for anyone in the household, the origin of a householder in a previously processed household with the same race was assigned. This procedure is a variation of the general imputation procedures described in ``Accuracy of the Data,'' and is similar to those used in 1990, except that for Census 2000, race and Spanish surnames were used to assist in assigning an origin. (For more information, see the ``Comparability'' section below.) Comparability. There are two important changes to the Hispanic origin question for Census 2000. First, the sequence of the race and Hispanic origin questions for Census 2000 differs from that in 1990; in 1990, the race question preceded the Hispanic origin question. Testing prior to Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B13   Census 2000 indicated that response to the Hispanic origin question could be improved by placing it before the race question without affecting the response to the race question. Second, there is an instruction preceding the Hispanic origin question indicating that respondents should answer both the Hispanic origin and the race questions. This instruction was added to give emphasis to the distinct concepts of the Hispanic origin and race questions and to emphasize the need for both pieces of information. Furthermore, there has been a change in the processing of the Hispanic origin and race responses. In 1990, the Hispanic origin question and the race question had separate edits; therefore, although information may have been present on the questionnaire, it was not fully utilized due to the discrete nature of the edits. However, for Census 2000, there was a joint race and Hispanic origin edit which for example, made use of race responses in the Hispanic origin question to impute a race if none was given. HOUSEHOLD TYPE AND RELATIONSHIP Household A household includes all of the people who occupy a housing unit. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.) A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied (or if vacant, intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other people in the building and that have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. In 100-percent tabulations, the count of households or householders always equals the count of occupied housing units. In sample tabulations, the numbers may differ as a result of the weighting process. Average household size. A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in households by the total number of households (or householders). In cases where household members are tabulated by race or Hispanic origin, household members are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual. Average household size is rounded to the nearest hundredth. Relationship to Householder Householder. The data on relationship to householder were derived from the question, ``How is this person related to Person 1,'' which was asked of Persons 2 and higher in housing units. One person in each household is designated as the householder (Person 1). In most cases, the householder is the person, or one of the people, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented. If there is no such person in the household, any adult household member 15 years old and over could be designated as the householder (i.e., Person 1). Households are classified by type according to the sex of the householder and the presence of relatives. Two types of householders are distinguished: family householders and nonfamily householders. A family householder is a householder living with one or more individuals related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all of the people in the household related to him or her are family members. A nonfamily householder is a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only. Spouse (husband/wife). A spouse (husband/wife) is a person married to and living with a householder. People in formal marriages, as well as people in common-law marriages, are included. The number of spouses is equal to the number of ``married-couple families'' or ``married-couple households'' in 100-percent tabulations. Marital status categories cannot be inferred from the 100-percent tabulations since the marital status question was not included on the 100-percent form. In sample tabulations, the number of spouses may not be equal to the number of married-couple households due to the differences in the weighting procedures for sample data. B14 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Child. A child is a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or an adopted child of the householder, regardless of the child's age or marital status. The category excludes sons-in-law, daughters-inlaw, and foster children. Natural-born son/daughter. Natural-born son/daughter includes a son or daughter of the householder by birth, regardless of the age of the child. Adopted son/daughter. Adopted son/daughter includes a son or daughter of the householder by legal adoption, regardless of the age of the child. If a stepson/stepdaughter of the householder has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is then classified as an adopted child. Stepson/stepdaughter. Stepson/stepdaughter includes a son or daughter of the householder through marriage but not by birth, regardless of the age of the child. If a stepson/stepdaughter of the householder has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is then classified as an adopted child. Own child. Own child is a never-married child under 18 years who is a son or daughter of the householder by birth, marriage (a stepchild), or adoption. For 100-percent tabulations, own children consists of all sons/daughters of householders who are under 18 years old. For sample data, own children consists of sons/daughters of householders who are under 18 years old and who have never been married. Therefore, numbers of own children of householders may be different in these two tabulations since marital status was not collected as a 100-percent item in Census 2000. In certain tabulations, own children are further classified as living with two parents or with one parent only. Own children living with two parents are by definition found only in married-couple families. In a subfamily, an ``own child'' is a child under 18 years old who is a natural-born child, stepchild, or an adopted child of a mother in a mother-child subfamily, a father in father-child subfamily, or either spouse in a married-couple subfamily. (Note: In the tabulation under ``EMPLOYMENT STATUS'' of own children under 6 years by employment status of parents, the number of ``own children'' includes any child under 6 years old in a family or a subfamily who is a son or daughter, by birth, marriage, or adoption, of a member of the householder's family, but not necessarily of the householder.) Related children. Related children include the sons and daughters of the householder (including natural-born, adopted, or stepchildren) and all other people under 18 years old, regardless of marital status, in the household, who are related to the householder, except the spouse of the householder. Foster children are not included since they are not related to the householder. Other relatives. Other relatives include any household member related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption, but not included specifically in another relationship category. In certain detailed tabulations, the following categories may be shown: Grandchild. A grandchild is a grandson or granddaughter of the householder. Brother/sister. Brother/sister refers to the brother or sister of the householder, including stepbrothers, stepsisters, and brothers and sisters by adoption. Brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law are included in the ``Other relative'' category on the questionnaire. Parent. Parent refers to the father or mother of the householder, including a stepparent or adoptive parent. Fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law are included in the ``Parent-in-law'' category on the questionnaire. Parent-in-law. A parent-in-law is the mother-in-law or father-in-law of the householder. Son-in-law/daughter-in-law. A son-in-law/daughter-in-law, by definition, is a spouse of the child of the householder. Other relatives. Other relatives include anyone not listed in a reported category above who is related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption (brother-in-law, grandparent, nephew, aunt, cousin, and so forth). Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B15   Nonrelatives. Nonrelatives include any household member not related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption, including foster children. The following categories may be presented in more detailed tabulations: Roomer, boarder. A roomer or boarder is a person who lives in a room in the household of Person 1 (householder). Some sort of cash or noncash payment (e.g., chores) is usually made for their living accommodations. Housemate or roommate. A housemate or roommate is a person who is not related to the householder and who shares living quarters primarily to share expenses. Unmarried partner. An unmarried partner is a person who is not related to the householder, who shares living quarters, and who has a close personal relationship with the householder. Foster child. A foster child is a person who is under 18 years old placed by the local government in a household to receive parental care. They may be living in the household for just a brief period or for several years. Foster children are nonrelatives of the householder. If the foster child is also related to the householder, the child should be classified as that specific relative. Other nonrelatives. Other nonrelatives includes individuals who are not related by birth, marriage, or adoption to the householder and who are not described by the categories given above. Unrelated Individual An unrelated individual is: (1) a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only, (2) a household member who is not related to the householder, or (3) a person living in group quarters who is not an inmate of an institution. Family Type A family includes a householder and one or more other people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as part of the householder's family in census tabulations. Thus, the number of family households is equal to the number of families, but family households may include more members than do families. A household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations. Not all households contain families since a household may be comprised of a group of unrelated people or of one person living alone. Families are classified by type as either a ``married-couple family'' or ``other family'' according to the presence of a spouse. ``Other family'' is further broken out according to the sex of the householder. The data on family type are based on answers to questions on sex and relationship that were asked on a 100-percent basis. Married-couple family. This category includes a family in which the householder and his or her spouse are enumerated as members of the same household. Other family: Male householder, no wife present. This category includes a family with a male maintaining a household with no wife of the householder present. Female householder, no husband present. This category includes a family with a female maintaining a household with no husband of the householder present. Nonfamily household. This category includes a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only. B16 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Average family size. A measure total number of families (or family race or Hispanic origin, the race or the race or Hispanic origin of each hundredth. Subfamily  obtained by dividing the number of people in families by the householders). In cases where this measure is tabulated by Hispanic origin refers to that of the householder rather than to individual. Average family size is rounded to the nearest  A subfamily is a married couple with or without own children under 18 years old who are never-married, or a single parent with one or more own never-married children under 18 years old. A subfamily does not maintain their own household, but lives in a household where the householder or householder's spouse is a relative. Subfamilies are defined during processing of sample data. In some labor force tabulations, both one-parent families and one-parent subfamilies are included in the total number of children living with one parent, while both married-couple families and married-couple subfamilies are included in the total number of children living with two parents. Unmarried-Partner Household An unmarried-partner household is a household that includes a householder and an ``unmarried partner.'' An ``unmarried partner'' can be of the same or of the opposite sex of the householder. An ``unmarried partner'' in an ``unmarried-partner household'' is an adult who is unrelated to the householder, but shares living quarters and has a close personal relationship with the householder. An unmarried-partner household may also be a family household or a nonfamily household, depending on the presence or absence of another person in the household who is related to the householder. There may be only one unmarried-partner per household, and an unmarried partner may not be included in a married-couple household as the householder cannot have both a spouse and an unmarried partner. Comparability. The 1990 relationship category, ``Natural-born or adopted son/daughter'' has been replaced by ``Natural-born son/daughter'' and ``Adopted son/daughter.'' The following categories were added in Census 2000: ``Parent-in-law'' and ``Son-in-law/daughter-in-law.'' The 1990 nonrelative category, ``Roomer, boarder, or foster child'' was replaced by two categories: ``Roomer, boarder'' and ``Foster child.'' In 2000, foster children had to be in the local government's foster care system to be so classified. In 1990, foster children were estimated to be those children in households who were not related to the householder and for whom there were no people 18 years old and over who may have been their parents. In 1990, stepchildren who were adopted by the householder were still classified as stepchildren. In 2000, stepchildren who were legally adopted by the householder were classified as adopted children. Own children shown in 100-percent tabulations may be of any marital status. For comparability with previous censuses, own children shown for sample data are still restricted to never-married children. Some tables may show relationship to householder and be labeled ``child.'' These tabulations include all marital status categories of natural-born, adopted, or stepchildren. Because of changes in editing procedures, same sex unmarried-partner households in 1990 should not be compared with same sex unmarried-partner households in Census 2000. INCOME IN 1999 The data on income in 1999 were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Items 31 and 32, which were asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. ``Total income'' is the sum of the amounts reported separately for wage or salary income; net self-employment income; interest, dividends, or net rental or royalty income or income from estates and trusts; social security or railroad retirement income; Supplemental Security Income (SSI); public assistance or welfare payments; retirement, survivor, or disability pensions; and all other income. ``Earnings'' are defined as the sum of wage or salary income and net income from selfemployment. ``Earnings'' represent the amount of income received regularly for people 16 years old and over before deductions for personal income taxes, social security, bond purchases, union dues, medicare deductions, etc. Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B17   Receipts from the following sources are not included as income: capital gains, money received from the sale of property (unless the recipient was engaged in the business of selling such property); the value of income ``in kind'' from food stamps, public housing subsidies, medical care, employer contributions for individuals, etc.; withdrawal of bank deposits; money borrowed; tax refunds; exchange of money between relatives living in the same household; and gifts and lump-sum inheritances, insurance payments, and other types of lump-sum receipts. Income Type in 1999 The eight types of income reported in the census are defined as follows: 1. Wage or salary income. Wage or salary income includes total money earnings received for work performed as an employee during the calendar year 1999. It includes wages, salary, armed forces pay, commissions, tips, piece-rate payments, and cash bonuses earned before deductions were made for taxes, bonds, pensions, union dues, etc. 2. Self-employment income. Self-employment income includes both farm and nonfarm self-employment income. Nonfarm self-employment income includes net money income (gross receipts minus expenses) from one's own business, professional enterprise, or partnership. Gross receipts include the value of all goods sold and services rendered. Expenses include costs of goods purchased, rent, heat, light, power, depreciation charges, wages and salaries paid, business taxes (not personal income taxes), etc. Farm self-employment income includes net money income (gross receipts minus operating expenses) from the operation of a farm by a person on his or her own account, as an owner, renter, or sharecropper. Gross receipts include the value of all products sold, government farm programs, money received from the rental of farm equipment to others, and incidental receipts from the sale of wood, sand, gravel, etc. Operating expenses include cost of feed, fertilizer, seed, and other farming supplies, cash wages paid to farmhands, depreciation charges, cash rent, interest on farm mortgages, farm building repairs, farm taxes (not state and federal personal income taxes), etc. The value of fuel, food, or other farm products used for family living is not included as part of net income. 3. Interest, dividends, or net rental income. Interest, dividends, or net rental income includes interest on savings or bonds, dividends from stockholdings or membership in associations, net income from rental of property to others and receipts from boarders or lodgers, net royalties, and periodic payments from an estate or trust fund. 4. Social security income. Social security income includes social security pensions and survivors benefits, permanent disability insurance payments made by the Social Security Administration prior to deductions for medical insurance, and railroad retirement insurance checks from the U.S. government. Medicare reimbursements are not included. 5. Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a nationwide U.S. assistance program administered by the Social Security Administration that guarantees a minimum level of income for needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals. The census questionnaire for Puerto Rico asked about the receipt of SSI; however, SSI is not a federally administered program in Puerto Rico. Therefore, it is probably not being interpreted by most respondents as the same as SSI in the United States. The only way a resident of Puerto Rico could have appropriately reported SSI would have been if they lived in the United States at any time during calendar year 1999 and received SSI. 6. Public assistance income. Public assistance income includes general assistance and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). Separate payments received for hospital or other medical care (vendor payments) are excluded. This does not include Supplemental Security Income (SSI). 7. Retirement income. Retirement income includes: (1) retirement pensions and survivor benefits from a former employer; labor union; or federal, state, or local government; and the B18 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   U.S. military; (2) income from workers' compensation; disability income from companies or unions; federal, state, or local government; and the U.S. military; (3) periodic receipts from annuities and insurance; and (4) regular income from IRA and KEOGH plans. This does not include social security income. 8. All other income. All other income includes unemployment compensation, Veterans' Administration (VA) payments, alimony and child support, contributions received periodically from people not living in the household, military family allotments, and other kinds of periodic income other than earnings. Income of households. This includes the income of the householder and all other individuals 15 years old and over in the household, whether they are related to the householder or not. Because many households consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than average family income. Although the household income statistics cover calendar year 1999, the characteristics of individuals and the composition of households refer to the time of enumeration (April 1, 2000). Thus, the income of the household does not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the household during all or part of calendar year 1999 if these individuals no longer resided in the household at the time of enumeration. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did not reside in the household during 1999 but who were members of the household at the time of enumeration are included. However, the composition of most households was the same during 1999 as at the time of enumeration. Income of families. In compiling statistics on family income, the incomes of all members 15 years old and over related to the householder are summed and treated as a single amount. Although the family income statistics cover calendar year 1999, the characteristics of individuals and the composition of families refer to the time of enumeration (April 1, 2000). Thus, the income of the family does not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the family during all or part of calendar year 1999 if these individuals no longer resided with the family at the time of enumeration. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did not reside with the family during 1999 but who were members of the family at the time of enumeration are included. However, the composition of most families was the same during 1999 as at the time of enumeration. Income of individuals. Income for individuals is obtained by summing the eight types of income for each person 15 years old and over. The characteristics of individuals are based on the time of enumeration (April 1, 2000), even though the amounts are for calendar year 1999. Median income. The median divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median income and one-half above the median. For households and families, the median income is based on the distribution of the total number of households and families including those with no income. The median income for individuals is based on individuals 15 years old and over with income. Median income for households, families, and individuals is computed on the basis of a standard distribution (see the ``Standard Distributions'' section under ``Derived Measures''). Median income is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Median income figures are calculated using linear interpolation if the width of the interval containing the estimate is $2,500 or less. If the width of the interval containing the estimate is greater than $2,500, Pareto interpolation is used. (For more information on medians and interpolation, see ``Derived Measures.'') Aggregate income. Aggregate income is the sum of all incomes for a particular universe. Aggregate income is subject to rounding, which means that all cells in a matrix are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. (For more information, see ``Aggregate'' under ``Derived Measures.'') Mean income. Mean income is the amount obtained by dividing the aggregate income of a particular statistical universe by the number of units in that universe. Thus, mean household income is obtained by dividing total household income by the total number of households. (The aggregate used to calculate mean income is rounded. For more information, see ``Aggregate income.'') Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B19   For the various types of income, the means are based on households having those types of income. For households and families, the mean income is based on the distribution of the total number of households and families including those with no income. The mean income for individuals is based on individuals 15 years old and over with income. Mean income is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Care should be exercised in using and interpreting mean income values for small subgroups of the population. Because the mean is influenced strongly by extreme values in the distribution, it is especially susceptible to the effects of sampling variability, misreporting, and processing errors. The median, which is not affected by extreme values, is, therefore, a better measure than the mean when the population base is small. The mean, nevertheless, is shown in some data products for most small subgroups because, when weighted according to the number of cases, the means can be added to obtained summary measures for areas and groups other than those shown in census tabulations. (For more information on means, see ``Derived Measures.'') Earnings. Earnings are defined as the sum of wage or salary income and net income from self-employment. ``Earnings'' represent the amount of income received regularly for people 16 years old and over before deductions for personal income taxes, social security, bond purchases, union dues, medicare deductions, etc. Median earnings. The median divides the earnings distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median earnings and one-half above the median. Median earnings is restricted to individuals 16 years old and over and is computed on the basis of a standard distribution (see the ``Standard Distributions'' section under ``Derived Measures''). Median earnings figures are calculated using linear interpolation if the width of the interval containing the estimate is $2,500 or less. If the width of the interval containing the estimate is greater than $2,500, Pareto interpolation is used. (For more information on medians and interpolation, see ``Derived Measures.'') Aggregate earnings. Aggregate earnings are the sum of wage/salary and net self-employment income for a particular universe of people 16 years old and over. Aggregate earnings are subject to rounding, which means that all cells in a matrix are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. (For more information, see ``Aggregate'' under ``Derived Measures.'') Mean earnings. Mean earnings is calculated by dividing aggregate earnings by the population 16 years old and over with earnings. (The aggregate used to calculate mean earnings is rounded. For more information, see ``Aggregate earnings.'') Mean earnings is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. (For more information on means, see ``Derived Measures.'') Per capita income. Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group. It is derived by dividing the total income of a particular group by the total population in that group. (The aggregate used to calculate per capita income is rounded. For more information, see ``Aggregate'' under ``Derived Measures.'') Per capita income is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. (For more information on means, see ``Derived Measures.'') Limitation of the data. Since answers to income questions are frequently based on memory and not on records, many people tended to forget minor or sporadic sources of income and, therefore, underreport their income. Underreporting tends to be more pronounced for income sources that are not derived from earnings, such as public assistance, interest, dividends, and net rental income. Extensive computer editing procedures were instituted in the data processing operation to reduce some of these reporting errors and to improve the accuracy of the income data. These procedures corrected various reporting deficiencies and improved the consistency of reported income items associated with work experience and information on occupation and class of worker. For example, if people reported they were self employed on their own farm, not incorporated, but had reported  B20  Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   wage and salary earnings only, the latter amount was shifted to self-employment income. Also, if any respondent reported total income only, the amount was generally assigned to one of the types of income items according to responses to the work experience and class-of-worker questions. Another type of problem involved nonreporting of income data. Where income information was not reported, procedures were devised to impute appropriate values with either no income or positive or negative dollar amounts for the missing entries. (For more information on imputation, see ``Accuracy of the Data.'') In income tabulations for households and families, the lowest income group (for example, less than $10,000) includes units that were classified as having no 1999 income. Many of these were living on income ``in kind,'' savings, or gifts, were newly created families, or were families in which the sole breadwinner had recently died or left the household. However, many of the households and families who reported no income probably had some money income that was not reported in the census. Comparability. The income data collected in the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses are similar to Census 2000 data, but there are variations in the detail of the questions. In 1990, income information for 1989 was collected from people in approximately 17 percent of all housing units and group quarters. Each person 15 years old and over was required to report:  Wage or salary income  Net nonfarm self-employment income  Net farm self-employment income  Interest, dividend, or net rental or royalty income  Social security or railroad retirement income  Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), or other public assistance income  Retirement, survivor, or disability income  Income from all other sources Since the number of respondents reporting farm self-employment income has become smaller over the years, the farm and nonfarm self-employment items were combined into one item for Census 2000. Data users are still able to obtain an estimate of ``farm self-employment'' income by looking at net self-employment income in combination with other labor force related questions such as ``occupation of longest job.'' Supplemental Security Income (SSI) was asked separately from other public assistance income or welfare received from a state or local welfare office in Census 2000. Between the 1990 census and Census 2000, there were minor differences in the processing of the data. In both censuses, all people with missing values in one or more of the detailed type of income items were designated as allocated. Each missing entry was imputed either as a ``no'' or as a dollar amount. If total income was reported and one or more of the type of income fields was not answered, then the entry in total income generally was assigned to one of the income types according to the socioeconomic characteristics of the income recipient. This person was designated as unallocated. In 2000 and 1990, all nonrespondents with income not reported (whether householders or other people) were assigned the reported income of people with similar characteristics. (For more information on imputation, see ``Accuracy of the Data.'') In 1980, income information for 1979 was collected from people in approximately 19 percent of all housing units and group quarters. Each person 15 years old and over was required to report:  Wage or salary income  Net nonfarm self-employment income Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B21    Net farm self-employment income  Interest, dividend, or net rental or royalty income  Social security or railroad retirement income  Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), or other public assistance income  Income from all other sources There was a difference in the method of computer derivation of aggregate income from individual amounts. In the 1980 census, income amounts less than $100,000 were coded in tens of dollars, and amounts of $100,000 or more were coded in thousands of dollars; $5 was added to each amount coded in tens of dollars and $500 to each amount coded in thousands of dollars. Entries of $999,000 or more were treated as $999,500 and losses of $9,999 or more were treated as minus $9,999. In the 1990 and 2000 censuses, income amounts less than $999,999 were keyed to the nearest dollar. Amounts of $999,999 or more were treated as $999,999 and losses of $9,999 or more were treated as minus $9,999 in all of the computer derivations of aggregate income. In 1970, information on income in 1969 was obtained from all members in every fifth housing unit 14 years old and over and small group quarters (less than 15 people) and every fifth person in all other group quarters. Each person 14 years old and over was required to report:  Wage or salary income  Net nonfarm self-employment income  Net farm self-employment income  Social security or railroad retirement income  Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), or other public assistance income  Income from all other sources If a person reported a dollar amount in wage or salary, net nonfarm self-employment income, or net farm self-employment income, the person was considered as unallocated only if no further dollar amounts were imputed for any additional missing entries. In 1960, data on income were obtained from all members 14 years old and over in every fourth housing unit and from every fourth person 14 years old and over living in group quarters. Each person was required to report wage or salary income, net self-employment income, and income other than earnings received in 1959. An assumption was made in the editing process that no other type of income was received by a person who reported the receipt of either wage and salary income or self-employment but who had failed to report the receipt of other money income. For several reasons, the income data shown in census tabulations are not directly comparable with those that may be obtained from statistical summaries of income tax returns. Income, as defined for federal tax purposes, differs somewhat from the Census Bureau concept. Moreover, the coverage of income tax statistics is different because of the exemptions of people having small amounts of income and the inclusion of net capital gains in tax returns. Furthermore, members of some families file separate returns and others file joint returns; consequently, the income reporting unit is not consistently either a family or a person. The earnings data shown in census tabulations are not directly comparable with earnings records of the Social Security Administration. The earnings record data for 1999 excluded the earnings of some civilian government employees, some employees of nonprofit organizations, workers covered by the Railroad Retirement Act, and people not covered by the program because of insufficient earnings. Because census data are obtained from household questionnaires, they may differ from Social Security Administration earnings record data, which are based upon employers' reports and the federal income tax returns of self-employed people. B22 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce publishes annual data on aggregate and per-capita personal income received by the population for states, metropolitan areas, and selected counties. Aggregate income estimates based on the income statistics shown in census products usually would be less than those shown in the BEA income series for several reasons. The Census Bureau data are obtained directly from households; whereas, the BEA income series is estimated largely on the basis of data from administrative records of business and governmental sources. Moreover, the definitions of income are different. The BEA income series includes some items not included in the income data shown in census publications, such as income ``in kind,'' income received by nonprofit institutions, the value of services of banks and other financial intermediaries rendered to people without the assessment of specific charges, medicare payments, and the income of people who died or emigrated prior to April 1, 2000. On the other hand, the census income data include contributions for support received from people not residing in the same household if the income is received on a regular basis. In comparing income data for 1999 with earlier years, it should be noted that an increase or decrease in money income does not necessarily represent a comparable change in real income, unless adjustments for changes in prices are made. INDUSTRY, OCCUPATION, AND CLASS OF WORKER The data on industry, occupation, and class of worker were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Items 27, 28, and 29 respectively, which were asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. Information on industry relates to the kind of business conducted by a person's employing organization; occupation describes the kind of work a person does on the job. For employed people, the data refer to the person's job during the reference week. For those who worked at two or more jobs, the data refer to the job at which the person worked the greatest number of hours during the reference week. For unemployed people, the data refer to their last job. The industry and occupation statistics are derived from the detailed classification systems developed for Census 2000 as described below. Respondents provided the data for the tabulations by writing on the questionnaires descriptions of their industry and occupation. These descriptions were data captured and sent to an automated coder (computer software), which assigned a portion of the written entries to categories in the classification system. The automated system assigned codes to 59 percent of the industry entries and 56 percent of the occupation entries. Those cases not coded by the computer were referred to clerical staff in the Census Bureau's National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana, for coding. The clerical staff converted the written questionnaire responses to codes by comparing these responses to entries in the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations. For the industry code, these coders also referred to an Employer Name List. This list, prepared from the American Business Index (ABI), contained the names of business establishments and their North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes converted to population census equivalents. This list facilitated coding and maintained industrial classification comparability. Industry The industry classification system used during Census 2000 was developed for the census and consists of 265 categories for employed people, classified into 14 major industry groups. From 1940 through 1990, the industrial classification has been based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual. The Census 2000 classification was developed from the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) published by the Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President. NAICS is an industry description system that groups establishments into industries based on the activities in which they are primarily engaged. The NAICS differs from most industry classifications because it is a supply-based, or production-oriented economic concept. Census data, which were collected from households, differ in detail and nature from those obtained from establishment surveys. Therefore, the census classification system, while defined in NAICS terms, cannot reflect the full detail in all categories. Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B23   NAICS shows a more detailed hierarchical structure than that used for Census 2000. The expansion from 11 divisions in the SIC to 20 sectors in the NAICS provides groupings that are meaningful and useful for economic analysis. Various statistical programs that previously sampled or published at the SIC levels face problems with the coverage for 20 sectors instead of 11 divisions. These programs requested an alternative aggregation structure for production purposes which was approved and issued by the Office of Management and Budget on May 15, 2001, in the clarification Memorandum No. 2, ``NAICS Alternate Aggregation Structure for Use by U.S. Statistical Agencies.'' Several census data products will use the alternative aggregation, while others, such as Summary File 3 and Summary File 4, will use more detail. Occupation The occupational classification system used during Census 2000 consists of 509 specific occupational categories for employed people arranged into 23 major occupational groups. This classification was developed based on the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual: 2000, which includes a hierarchical structure showing 23 major occupational groups divided into 96 minor groups, 449 broad groups, and 821 detailed occupations. For Census 2000, tabulations with occupation as the primary characteristic present several levels of occupational detail. Some occupation groups are related closely to certain industries. Operators of transportation equipment, farm operators and workers, and healthcare providers account for major portions of their respective industries of transportation, agriculture, and health care. However, the industry categories include people in other occupations. For example, people employed in agriculture include truck drivers and bookkeepers; people employed in the transportation industry include mechanics, freight handlers, and payroll clerks; and people employed in the health care industry include occupations such as security guard and secretary. Class of Worker The data on class of worker were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 29. The information on class of worker refers to the same job as a respondent's industry and occupation, categorizing people according to the type of ownership of the employing organization. The class of worker categories are defined as follows: Private wage and salary workers. Private wage and salary workers include people who worked for wages, salary, commission, tips, pay-in-kind, or piece rates for a private for-profit employer or a private not-for-profit, tax-exempt, or charitable organization. Self-employed people whose business was incorporated are included with private wage and salary workers because they are paid employees of their own companies. Some tabulations present data separately for these subcategories: ``for-profit,'' ``not-for-profit,'' and ``own business incorporated.'' Government workers. Government workers includes people who were employees of any federal, tribal, state, or local governmental unit, regardless of the activity of the particular agency. For some tabulations, the data were presented separately for federal (includes tribal), state, and local governments. Employees of foreign governments, the United Nations, or other formal international organizations were classified as ``federal government,'' unlike the 1990 census when they were classified as ``private not-for-profit.'' Self-employed in own not incorporated business workers. Self-employed in own not incorporated business workers includes people who worked for profit or fees in their own unincorporated business, professional practice, or trade, or who operated a farm. Unpaid family workers. Unpaid family workers includes people who worked 15 hours or more without pay in a business or on a farm operated by a relative. Self-employed in own incorporated business workers. In tabulations, this category is included with private wage and salary workers because they are paid employees of their own companies. B24 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   The industry category, ``Public administration,'' is limited to regular government functions, such as legislative, judicial, administrative, and regulatory activities of governments. Other government organizations, such as schools, hospitals, liquor stores, and bus lines, are classified by industry according to the activity in which they are engaged. On the other hand, the class of worker government categories include all government workers. In some cases, respondents supplied industry, occupation, or class of worker descriptions that were not sufficiently specific for a precise classification or did not report on these items at all. In the coding operation, certain types of incomplete entries were corrected using the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations. For example, it was possible in certain situations to assign an industry code based on the occupation reported, or vice versa. Following the coding operations, there was a computer edit and an allocation process. The edit first determined whether a respondent was in the universe that required an industry and occupation code. The codes for the three items (industry, occupation, and class of worker) were checked to ensure they were valid and were edited for their relation to each other. Invalid and inconsistent codes were either blanked or changed to a consistent code. If one or more of the three codes was blank after the edit, a code was assigned from a ``similar'' person based on other items, such as age, sex, education, farm or nonfarm residence, and weeks worked. If all of the labor force and income data were blank, all of these economic items were assigned from one other person or one other household who provided all the necessary data. Comparability. Comparability of industry and occupation data was affected by a number of factors, primarily the systems used to classify the questionnaire responses. For both the industry and occupation classification systems, the basic structures were generally the same from 1940 to 1970, but changes in the individual categories limited comparability of the data from one census to another. These changes were needed to recognize the ``birth'' of new industries and occupations, the ``death'' of others, the growth and decline in existing industries and occupations, and the desire of analysts and other users for more detail in the presentation of the data. Probably the greatest cause of noncomparability is the movement of a segment of a category to a different category in the next census. Changes in the nature of jobs and respondent terminology and refinement of category composition made these movements necessary. The 1990 occupational classification system was essentially the same as the 1980 census. However, the industry classification had minor changes between 1980 and 1990 that reflected changes to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). In Census 2000, both the industry and occupation classifications had major revisions to reflect changes to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). The conversion of the census classifications in 2000 means that the 2000 classification systems are not comparable to the classifications used in the 1990 census and earlier. Other factors that affected data comparability over the decades include the universe to which the data referred (in 1970, the age cutoff for labor force was changed from 14 years old to 16 years old); the wording of the industry and occupation questions on the questionnaire (for example, important changes were made in 1970); improvements in the coding procedures (the Employer Name List technique was introduced in 1960); and how the ``not reported'' cases were handled. Prior to 1970, they were placed in the residual categories, ``industry not reported'' and ``occupation not reported.'' In 1970, an allocation process was introduced that assigned these cases to major groups. In Census 2000, as in 1980 and 1990, the ``not reported'' cases were assigned to individual categories. Therefore, the 1980, 1990, and Census 2000 data for individual categories include some numbers of people who would have been tabulated in a ``not reported'' category in previous censuses. The following publications contain information on the various factors affecting comparability and are particularly useful for understanding differences in the occupation and industry information from earlier censuses: U.S. Census Bureau, Changes Between the 1950 and 1960 Occupation and Industry Classifications With Detailed Adjustments of 1950 Data to the 1960 Classifications, Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B25   Technical Paper No. 18, 1968; U.S. Census Bureau, 1970 Occupation and Industry Classification Systems in Terms of Their 1960 Occupation and Industry Elements, Technical Paper No. 26, 1972; and U.S. Census Bureau, The Relationship Between the 1970 and 1980 Industry and Occupation Classification Systems, Technical Paper No. 59, 1988. For citations for earlier census years, see the 1980 Census of Population report, PC80-1-D, Detailed Population Characteristics. The 1990 census introduced an additional class of worker category for ``private not-for-profit'' employers, which is also used for Census 2000. This category is a subset of the 1980 category ``employee of private employer'' so there is no comparable data before 1990. Also in 1990, employees of foreign governments, the United Nations, etc., were classified as ``private not-for-profit,'' rather than ``Federal Government'' as in 1970, 1980, and Census 2000. While in theory, there was a change in comparability, in practice, the small number of U.S. residents working for foreign governments made this change negligible. Comparability between the statistics on industry and occupation from Census 2000 and statistics from other sources is affected by many of the factors described in the ``Employment Status'' section. These factors are primarily geographic differences between residence and place of work, different dates of reference, and differences in counts because of dual job holdings. Industry data from population censuses cover all industries and all kinds of workers, whereas, data from establishments often exclude private household workers, government workers, and the self employed. Also, the replies from household respondents may have differed in detail and nature from those obtained from establishments. Occupation data from the census and data from government licensing agencies, professional associations, trade unions, etc., may not be as comparable as expected. Organizational listings often include people not in the labor force or people devoting all or most of their time to another occupation; or the same person may be included in two or more different listings. In addition, relatively few organizations, except for those requiring licensing, attained complete coverage of membership in a particular occupational field. JOURNEY TO WORK Place of Work The data on place of work were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 22, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week. (For more information, see ``Reference Week.'') Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the armed forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. Data on place of work refer to the geographic location at which workers carried out their occupational activities during the reference week. The exact address (number and street name) of the place of work was asked, as well as the place (city, town, or post office); whether or not the place of work was inside or outside the limits of that city or town; and the county, state or foreign country, and ZIP Code. If the person's employer operated in more than one location, the exact address of the location or branch where the respondent worked was requested. When the number and street name were unknown, a description of the location, such as the building name or nearest street or intersection, was to be entered. In areas where the workplace address was coded to the block level, people were tabulated as working inside or outside a specific place based on the location of that address, regardless of the response to Question 22c concerning city/town limits. In areas where it was impossible to code the workplace address to the block level, people were tabulated as working in a place if a place name was reported in Question 22b and the response to Question 22c was either ``yes'' or the item was left blank. In selected areas, census designated places (CDPs) may appear in the tabulations as places of work. The accuracy of place-of-work data for CDPs may be affected by the extent to which their census names were familiar to respondents, and by coding problems caused by similarities between the CDP name and the names of other geographic jurisdictions in the same vicinity. B26 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Place-of-work data are given for minor civil divisions (MCDs) (generally, cities, towns, and townships) in 12 selected states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin), based on the responses to the place-of-work question. The MCDs in these 12 states also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for the MCDs in all data products in which it provides data for places. Many towns and townships are regarded locally as equivalent to a place, and therefore, were reported as the place of work. When a respondent reported a locality or incorporated place that formed a part of a township or town, the coding and tabulating procedure was designed to include the response in the total for the township or town. Limitation of the data. The data on place of work relate to a reference week; that is, the calendar week preceding the date on which the respondents completed their questionnaires or were interviewed by enumerators. This week is not the same for all respondents because the enumeration was not completed in 1 week. However, for the majority of people, the reference week for Census 2000 is the week ending with April 1, 2000. The lack of a uniform reference week means that the place-of-work data reported in Census 2000 do not exactly match the distribution of workplace locations observed or measured during an actual work week. The place-of-work data are estimates of people 16 years old and over who were both employed and at work during the reference week (including people in the armed forces). People who did not work during the reference week but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons are not included in the place-of-work data. Therefore, the data on place of work understate the total number of jobs or total employment in a geographic area during the reference week. It also should be noted that people who had irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs during the reference week may have erroneously reported themselves as not working. The address where the individual worked most often during the reference week was recorded on the Census 2000 questionnaire. If a worker held two jobs, only data about the primary job (the one worked the greatest number of hours during the preceding week) was requested. People who regularly worked in several locations during the reference week were requested to give the address at which they began work each day. For cases in which daily work was not begun at a central place each day, the person was asked to provide as much information as possible to describe the area in which he or she worked most during the reference week. Comparability. The wording of the question on place of work was substantially the same in Census 2000, the 1990 census, and the 1980 census. However, data on place of work from Census 2000 and the 1990 census are based on the full census sample, while data from the 1980 census were based on only about one-half of the full sample. For the 1980 census, nonresponse or incomplete responses to the place-of-work question were not allocated, resulting in the use of ``not reported'' categories in the 1980 publications. However, for Census 2000 and the 1990 census, when place of work was not reported or the response was incomplete, a work location was allocated to the person based on their means of transportation to work, travel time to work, industry, and location of residence and workplace of others. Census 2000 and 1990 census tabulations, therefore, do not contain a ``not reported'' category for the place-of-work data. Comparisons between 1980, 1990, or Census 2000 data on the gross number of workers in particular commuting flows, or the total number of people working in an area, should be made with extreme caution. Any apparent increase in the magnitude of the gross numbers may be due solely to the fact that for Census 2000 and the 1990 census, the ``not reported'' cases have been distributed among specific place-of-work destinations, instead of tallied in a separate category, as in 1980. Means of Transportation to Work The data on means of transportation to work were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 23a, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B27   This question was asked of people who indicated in Question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week. (For more information, see ``Reference Week.'') Means of transportation to work refers to the principal mode of travel or type of conveyance that the worker usually used to get from home to work during the reference week. Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the armed forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. People who used different means of transportation on different days of the week were asked to specify the one they used most often, that is, the greatest number of days. People who used more than one means of transportation to get to work each day were asked to report the one used for the longest distance during the work trip. The category ``Car, truck, or van -- drove alone'' includes people who usually drove alone to work, as well as people who were driven to work by someone who then drove back home or to a nonwork destination during the reference week. The category ``Car, truck, or van -- carpooled'' includes workers who reported that two or more people usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. The category ``Public transportation'' includes workers who usually used a bus or trolley bus, streetcar or trolley car, subway or elevated, railroad, ferryboat, or taxicab during the reference week. Pblico is included in the ``Public transportation'' category in Puerto Rico. The category ``Other means'' includes workers who used a mode of travel that is not identified separately. The category ``Other means'' may vary from table to table, depending on the amount of detail shown in a particular distribution. The means of transportation data for some areas may show workers using modes of public transportation that are not available in those areas (for example, subway or elevated riders in a metropolitan area where there actually is no subway or elevated service). This result is largely due to people who worked during the reference week at a location that was different from their usual place of work (such as people away from home on business in an area where subway service was available) and people who used more than one means of transportation each day but whose principal means was unavailable where they lived (for example, residents of nonmetropolitan areas who drove to the fringe of a metropolitan area and took the commuter railroad most of the distance to work). Private Vehicle Occupancy The data on private vehicle occupancy were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 23b, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in Question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in Question 23a that their means of transportation to work was ``Car, truck, or van.'' (For more information, see ``Reference Week.'') Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the armed forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. Private vehicle occupancy refers to the number of people who usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. The category ``Drove alone,'' includes people who usually drove alone to work as well as people who were driven to work by someone who then drove back home or to a nonwork destination. The category ``Carpooled,'' includes workers who reported that two or more people usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. Workers per car, truck, or van. This is obtained by dividing the number of people who reported using a car, truck, or van to get to work by the number of such vehicles that they used. The number of vehicles used is derived by counting each person who drove alone as one vehicle, each person who reported being in a 2-person carpool as one-half of a vehicle, each person who reported being in a three-person carpool as one-third of a vehicle, and so on, and then summing all the vehicles. Workers per car, truck, or van is rounded to the nearest hundredth. Time Leaving Home to Go to Work The data on time leaving home to go to work were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 24a, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in Question 21 that they worked at some time B28 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   during the reference week and who reported in Question 23a that they worked outside their home. The departure time refers to the time of day that the person usually left home to go to work during the reference week. (For more information, see ``Reference Week.'') Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the armed forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. Travel Time to Work The data on travel time to work were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 24b, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in Question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in Question 23a that they worked outside their home. Travel time to work refers to the total number of minutes that it usually took the person to get from home to work each day during the reference week. The elapsed time includes time spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. (For more information, see ``Reference Week.'') Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the armed forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. Aggregate travel time to work (minutes). Aggregate travel time to work (minutes) is calculated by adding together all the number of minutes each worker traveled to work (one way) for specified travel times and/or means of transportation. Aggregate travel time to work is zero if the aggregate is zero, is rounded to 4 minutes if the actual aggregate is 1 to 7 minutes, and is rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 minutes for all other values (if the aggregate is not already evenly divisible by 5). (For more information, see ``Aggregate'' under ``Derived Measures.'') Mean travel time to work (minutes). Mean travel time to work is the average travel time in minutes that workers usually took to get from home to work (one way) during the reference week. This measure is obtained by dividing the total number of minutes taken to get from home to work by the number of workers 16 years old and over who did not work at home. The travel time includes time spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. Mean travel times of workers having specific characteristics also are computed. For example, the mean travel time of workers traveling 45 or more minutes is computed by dividing the aggregate travel time of workers whose travel time was 45 or more minutes by the number of workers whose travel time was 45 or more minutes. Mean travel time to work is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on means, see ``Derived Measures.'') LANGUAGE SPOKEN AT HOME AND ABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH Language Spoken at Home Data on language spoken at home were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Items 11a and 11b, which were asked of a sample of the population. Data were edited to include in tabulations only the population 5 years old and over. Questions 11a and 11b referred to languages spoken at home in an effort to measure the current use of languages other than English. People who knew languages other than English but did not use them at home or who only used them elsewhere were excluded. Most people who reported speaking a language other than English at home also speak English. The questions did not permit determination of the primary or dominant language of people who spoke both English and another language. (For more information, see discussion below on ``Ability to Speak English.'') Instructions to enumerators and questionnaire assistance center staff stated that a respondent should mark ``Yes'' in Question 11a if the person sometimes or always spoke a language other than English at home. Also, respondents were instructed not to mark ``Yes'' if a language other than English was spoken only at school or work, or if speaking another language was limited to a  Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B29   few expressions or slang of the other language. For Question 11b, respondents were instructed to print the name of the non-English language spoken at home. If the person spoke more than one language other than English, the person was to report the language spoken more often or the language learned first. For people who indicated that they spoke a language other than English at home in Question 11a, but failed to specify the name of the language in Question 11b, the language was assigned based on the language of other speakers in the household, on the language of a person of the same Spanish origin or detailed race group living in the same or a nearby area, or of a person of the same place of birth or ancestry. In all cases where a person was assigned a non-English language, it was assumed that the language was spoken at home. People for whom a language other than English was entered in Question 11b, and for whom Question 11a was blank were assumed to speak that other language at home. The write-in responses listed in Question 11b (specific language spoken) were optically scanned or keyed onto computer files, then coded into more than 380 detailed language categories using an automated coding system. The automated procedure compared write-in responses reported by respondents with entries in a master code list, which initially contained approximately 2,000 language names, and added variants and misspellings found in the 1990 census. Each write-in response was given a numeric code that was associated with one of the detailed categories in the dictionary. If the respondent listed more than one non-English language, only the first was coded. The write-in responses represented the names people used for languages they speak. They may not match the names or categories used by linguists. The sets of categories used are sometimes geographic and sometimes linguistic. The following table provides an illustration of the content of the classification schemes used to present language data.

In households where one or more people (5 years old and over) speak a language other than English, the household language assigned to all household members is the non-English language spoken by the first person with a non-English language in the following order: householder, spouse, parent, sibling, child, grandchild, in-laws, other relatives, stepchild, unmarried partner, housemate or roommate, and other nonrelatives. Thus, a person who speaks only English may have a non-English household language assigned to him/her in tabulations of individuals by household language. Language density. Language density is a household measure of the number of household members who speak a language other than English at home in three categories: none, some, and all speak another language. Limitation of the data. Some people who speak a language other than English at home may have first learned that language at school. However, these people would be expected to indicate that they spoke English ``Very well.'' People who speak a language other than English, but do not do so at home, should have been reported as not speaking a language other than English at home. The extreme detail in which language names were coded may give a false impression of the linguistic precision of these data. The names used by speakers of a language to identify it may reflect ethnic, geographic, or political affiliations and do not necessarily respect linguistic distinctions. The categories shown in the tabulations were chosen on a number of criteria, such as information about the number of speakers of each language that might be expected in a sample of the U.S. population. Comparability. Information on language has been collected in every census since 1890, except 1950. The comparability of data among censuses is limited by changes in question wording, by the subpopulations to whom the question was addressed, and by the detail that was published. Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B31   The same question on language was asked in 1980, 1990, and Census 2000. This question on the current language spoken at home replaced the questions asked in prior censuses on mother tongue; that is, the language other than English spoken in the person's home when he or she was a child; one's first language; or the language spoken before immigrating to the United States. The censuses of 1910-1940, 1960, and 1970 included questions on mother tongue. A change in coding procedures from 1980 to 1990 improved accuracy of coding and may have affected the number of people reported in some of the 380 plus categories. In 1980, coding clerks supplied numeric codes for the written entries on each questionnaire using a 2,000 name reference list. In 1990, written entries were keyed, then transcribed to a computer file and matched to a computer dictionary that began with the 2,000 name list. The name list was expanded as unmatched entries were referred to headquarters specialists for resolution. In Census 2000, the written entries were transcribed by ``optical character recognition'' (OCR), or manually keyed when the computer could not read the entry. Then all language entries were copied to a separate computer file and matched to a master code list. The code list is the master file developed from all language unique entries on the 1990 census, and included over 55,000 entries. The computerized matching ensured that identical alphabetic entries received the same code. Unmatched entries were referred to headquarters specialists for coding. In 2000, entries were reported in about 350 of the 380 categories. Ability to Speak English Data on ability to speak English were derived from the answers to long-form questionnaire Item 11c, which was asked of a sample of the population. Respondents who reported that they spoke a language other than English in long-form questionnaire Item 11a were asked to indicate their ability to speak English in one of the following categories: ``Very well,'' ``Well,'' ``Not well,'' or ``Not at all.'' The data on ability to speak English represent the person's own perception about his or her own ability or, because census questionnaires are usually completed by one household member, the responses may represent the perception of another household member. Respondents were not instructed on how to interpret the response categories in Question 11c. People who reported that they spoke a language other than English at home, but whose ability to speak English was not reported, were assigned the English-language ability of a randomly selected person of the same age, Hispanic origin, nativity and year of entry, and language group. Linguistic isolation. A household in which no person 14 years old and over speaks only English and no person 14 years old and over who speaks a language other than English speaks English ``Very well'' is classified as ``linguistically isolated.'' In other words, a household in which all members 14 years old and over speak a non-English language and also speak English less than ``Very well'' (have difficulty with English) is ``linguistically isolated.'' All the members of a linguistically isolated household are tabulated as linguistically isolated, including members under 14 years old who may speak only English. Comparability. The current question on ability to speak English was asked for the first time in 1980. From 1890 to 1910, ``Able to speak English, yes/no'' was asked along with two literacy questions. In tabulations from 1980, the categories ``Very well'' and ``Well'' were combined. Data from other surveys suggested a major difference between the category ``Very well'' and the remaining categories. In some tabulations showing ability to speak English, people who reported that they spoke English ``Very well'' are presented separately from people who reported their ability to speak English as less than ``Very well.'' MARITAL STATUS The data on marital status were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 7, ``What is this person's marital status,'' which was asked of a sample of the population. The marital status classification refers to the status at the time of enumeration. Data on marital status are tabulated only for the population 15 years old and over. B32 Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Each person was asked whether they were ``Now married,'' ``Widowed,'' ``Divorced,'' ``Separated,'' or ``Never married.'' Couples who live together (for example, people in common-law marriages) were able to report the marital status they considered to be the most appropriate. Never married. Never married includes all people who have never been married, including people whose only marriage(s) was annulled. Ever married. Ever married includes people married at the time of enumeration, along with those who are separated, widowed, or divorced. Now married, except separated. Now married, except separated includes people whose current marriage has not ended through widowhood or divorce; or who are not currently separated. The category also may include people in common-law marriages if they consider this category the most appropriate. In certain tabulations, currently married people are further classified as ``spouse present'' or ``spouse absent.'' Separated. Separated includes people with legal separations, people living apart with intentions of obtaining a divorce, and people who are permanently or temporarily separated because of marital discord. Widowed. This category includes widows and widowers who have not remarried. Divorced. This category includes people who are legally divorced and who have not remarried. Now married. All people whose current marriage has not ended by widowhood or divorce. This category includes people defined above as ``separated.'' Spouse present. Married people whose wives or husbands were enumerated as members of the same household or the same group quarters facility, including those whose spouses may have been temporarily absent for such reasons as travel or hospitalization. Spouse absent. Married people whose wives or husbands were not enumerated as members of the same household or the same group quarters facility. Separated. Defined above. Spouse absent, other. Married people whose wives or husbands were not enumerated as members of the same household, excluding separated. For example, this includes any person whose spouse was employed and living away from home, in an institution, or away in the armed forces. Differences between the number of currently married males and the number of currently married females occur because of reporting differences and because some husbands and wives have their usual residence in different areas. These differences also can occur because different weights are applied to the individual's data. Any differences between the number of ``now married, spouse present'' males and females are due solely to sample weighting procedures. By definition, the numbers would be the same. Comparability. Census 2000 marital status definitions are the same as those used in 1990. A general marital status question has been asked in every census since 1880. While the marital status question in Census 2000 is identical to that of 1990, in Census 2000 the question was only asked on the long form, while in previous years it was asked on the short form. PLACE OF BIRTH The data on place of birth were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 12 which was asked of a sample of the population. Respondents were asked to report the U.S. state, Puerto Rico, U.S. Island Area, or foreign country where they were born. People not reporting a place of birth were assigned the state or country of birth of another family member or their residence 5 years earlier, or were imputed the response of another person with similar characteristics. People Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B33   born outside the United States were asked to report their place of birth according to current international boundaries. Since numerous changes in boundaries of foreign countries have occurred in the last century, some people may have reported their place of birth in terms of boundaries that existed at the time of their birth or emigration, or in accordance with their own national preference. The place of birth question for residents of Puerto Rico was identical to the question on the stateside questionnaires. The same code lists were used to code the responses and similar edits were applied. Nativity. Information on place of birth and citizenship status was used to classify the population into two major categories: native and foreign born. (See ``Native'' and ``Foreign Born'' under ``Citizenship Status.'') Comparability. The 2000 decennial census place of birth question matches the 1999 and subsequent American Community Survey (ACS) questions. The 1990 decennial census place of birth question matches the 1996-1998 ACS questions. For the 2000 decennial census and post-1998 ACS samples, separate check boxes and write-in spaces were used for people born in the United Sates and those born outside the United States. Data on place of birth have been collected in each U.S. census since 1850. In prior censuses, the place of birth question asked respondents to report the state or foreign country where they were born. There were no check boxes in prior censuses. Nonresponse to the place of birth question has been imputed to some degree since 1970. For 1970 through 1990, state of birth was imputed for people born in the United States; people born outside the United States were assigned ``born abroad, country not specified'' or ``born in an outlying area, not specified.'' In 2000, a specific Island Area (referred to as ``outlying areas'' in previous censuses) or country of birth was imputed. Data on place of birth for Puerto Rico was asked beginning in 1910. In censuses prior to 2000, the place of birth question asked respondents to report the municipio in Puerto Rico as well as the U.S. state or the foreign country where they were born. Tabulations for those censuses showed people who were born in the same or a different municipio. Municipio of birth was not asked in 2000. Nonresponse was imputed in 1980 and 1990 for all questions, but a specific foreign country was not imputed until 2000. Parental nativity (birthplace of parents) was asked of a sample of the population in each decennial census between 1870 and 1970. The 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses instead included a question on ancestry, except for the U.S. Island Areas (such as Guam) which asked the parental nativity question. (See ``Ancestry.'') POVERTY STATUS IN 1999 The poverty data were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Items 31 and 32, the same questions used to derive income data. (For more information, see ``Income in 1999.'') The Census Bureau uses the federal government's official poverty definition. The Social Security Administration (SSA) developed the original poverty definition in 1964, which federal interagency committees subsequently revised in 1969 and 1980. The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Directive 14 prescribes this definition as the official poverty measure for federal agencies to use in their statistical work. Derivation of the Current Poverty Measure When the Social Security Administration (SSA) created the poverty definition in 1964, it focused on family food consumption. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) used its data about the nutritional needs of children and adults to construct food plans for families. Within each food plan, dollar amounts varied according to the total number of people in the family and the family's composition, such as the number of children within each family. The cheapest of these plans, the Economy Food Plan, was designed to address the dietary needs of families on an austere budget.  B34  Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Since the USDA's 1955 Food Consumption Survey showed that families of three or more people across all income levels spent roughly one-third of their income on food, the SSA multiplied the cost of the Economy Food Plan by three to obtain dollar figures for the poverty thresholds. Since the Economy Food Plan budgets varied by family size and composition, so too did the poverty thresholds. For 2-person families, the thresholds were adjusted by slightly higher factors because those households had higher fixed costs. Thresholds for unrelated individuals were calculated as a fixed proportion of the corresponding thresholds for 2-person families. The poverty thresholds are revised annually to allow for changes in the cost of living as reflected in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The poverty thresholds are the same for all parts of the country -- they are not adjusted for regional, state or local variations in the cost of living. For a detailed discussion of the poverty definition, see U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Reports, ``Poverty in the United States: 1999,'' P-60-210. How Poverty Status is Determined The poverty status of families and unrelated individuals in 1999 was determined using 48 thresholds (income cutoffs) arranged in a two dimensional matrix. The matrix consists of family size (from 1 person to 9 or more people) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to 8 or more children present). Unrelated individuals and 2-person families were further differentiated by the age of the reference person (RP) (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over). To determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person's total family income with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition (see table below). If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered poor, together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. Weighted average thresholds. Even though the official poverty data are based on the 48 thresholds arranged by family size and number of children within the family, data users often want to get an idea of the ``average'' threshold for a given family size. The weighted average thresholds provide that summary. They are weighted averages because for any given family size, families with a certain number of children may be more or less common than families with a different number of children. In other words, among 3-person families, there are more families with two adults and one child than families with three adults. To get the weighted average threshold for families of a particular size, multiply each threshold by the number of families for whom that threshold applies; then add up those products, and divide by the total number of families who are of that family size. For example, for 3-person families, 1999 weighted thresholds were calculated in the following way using information from the 2000 Current Population Survey: Family type No children (three adults) One child (two adults) Two children (one adult) Totals Number of families 5,213 8,208 2,656 16,077 * * * Threshold $13,032 = $67,935,816 $13,410 = $110,069,280 $13,423 = $35,651,488 $213,656,584  Source: Current Population Survey, March 2000.  Dividing $213,656,584 by 16,077 (the total number of 3-person families) yields $13,290, the weighted average threshold for 3-person families. Please note that the thresholds are weighted not just by the number of poor families, but by all families for which the thresholds apply: the thresholds are used to determine which families are at or above poverty, as well as below poverty. Individuals for whom poverty status is determined. Poverty status was determined for all people except institutionalized people, people in military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15 years old. These groups also were excluded from the numerator and denominator when calculating poverty rates. They are considered neither ``poor'' nor ``nonpoor.'' Definitions of Subject Characteristics U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  B35   Specified poverty levels. For various reasons, the official poverty definition does not satisfy all the needs of data users. Therefore, some of the data reflect the number of people below different percentages of the poverty level. These specified poverty levels are obtained by multiplying the official thresholds by the appropriate factor. For example, the average income cutoff at 125 percent of the poverty level was $21,286 ($17,029 x 1.25) in 1999 for family of four people.  Poverty Threshold in 1999, by Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years Old (Dollars) Related children under 18 years old Size of family unit Weighted average threshold 8501 8667 7990 10869 11214 10075 13290 17029 20127 22727 25912 28967 34417 11156 10070 13032 17184 20723 23835 27425 30673 36897 11483 11440 13410 17465 21024 23930 27596 30944 37076 13423 16895 20380 23436 27006 30387 36583 16954 19882 22964 26595 29899 36169 None One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight or more  One person (unrelated individual) .............

Income deficit represents the difference between the total income of families and unrelated individuals below the poverty level and their respective poverty thresholds. In computing the income deficit, families reporting a net income loss are assigned zero dollars and for such cases the deficit is equal to the poverty threshold. This measure provides an estimate of the amount which would be required to raise the incomes of all poor families and unrelated individuals to their respective poverty thresholds. The income deficit is thus a measure of the degree of the impoverishment of a family or unrelated individual. However, please use caution when comparing the average deficits of families with different characteristics. Apparent differences in average income deficits may, to some extent, be a function of differences in family size. Aggregate income deficit. Aggregate income deficit refers only to those families or unrelated individuals who are classified as below the poverty level. It is defined as the group (e.g., type of family) sum total of differences between the appropriate threshold and total family income or total personal income. Aggregate income deficit is subject to rounding, which means that all cells in a matrix are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. (For more information, see ``Aggregate'' under ``Derived Measures.'') Mean income deficit. Mean income deficit represents the amount obtained by dividing the total income deficit for a group below the poverty level by the number of families (or unrelated individuals) in that group. (The aggregate used to calculate mean income deficit is rounded. For more information, s

The guidance presented in this document is intended for any Federal agencies or organizational units that maintain, collect, or present data on race and ethnicity for Federal statistical purposes, program administrative reporting, or civil rights compliance reporting. This is a substantially updated version of the earlier guidance that was made available in February 1999. It reflects public comments on the previous version as well as the Tabulation Working Group's further research and deliberations. The guidance, which was requested by Federal agencies and the many users of data on race and ethnicity, continues to be developed with the involvement of these constituencies. By design, this guidance does not cover all of the specific issues individual agencies will need to address during their implementation of the 1997 standards. The guidance for implementing the 1997 standards focuses on three areas: collecting data, tabulating data, and building bridges to compare data collected under the 1997 and the 1977 standards. In some areas work is ongoing, and the guidance will be updated as additional research and analyses are completed. We expect that the guidance will evolve further as data from Census 2000 and other data collections employing the 1997 collection standards become available, as agencies address implementation issues in their respective programs, and as additional research needs are identified and addressed. In keeping with the process that guided the development of the 1997 standards for data on race and ethnicity, we are looking forward to a continuing dialogue on this provisional guidance. We welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions. Katherine K.

The guidance complements the Federal Government's decision in October 1997 to provide an opportunity for individuals to select one or more races when responding to agency requests for data on race and ethnicity. To foster comparability across data collections carried out by various agencies, it is useful for those agencies to report responses of more than one race using some standardized tabulations or formats. The report briefly explains why the tabulation guidelines are needed, reviews the general guidance issued when the standards were adopted in October 1997, and provides information on the criteria used in developing the guidelines. This report also addresses a larger set of implementation questions that have emerged during the working group's deliberations. Thus, the report considers: C C C C Collecting data on race and ethnicity using the 1997 standards; Tabulating Census 2000 data as well as data on race and ethnicity collected in surveys and from administrative records; Using data on race and ethnicity in applications such as legislative redistricting, civil rights monitoring and enforcement, and population estimates; and Comparing data under the 1997 and the 1977 standards when conducting trend analyses.  In addition, the appendices to the report provide the full text of reports on the research that has been conducted in two areas: approaches for collecting data on race and ethnicity, and approaches for bridging between data collected under the 1997 standards and data collected under the 1977 standards. The guidelines are necessarily provisional pending the availability of data from Census 2000 and other data systems as the 1997 standards are implemented. The guidelines provide a general framework and are not intended to cover all aspects of problems that agencies will encounter during their implementation of the 1997 standards. In some instances, for example, specific implementation issues are being address through OMB's paperwork review of data collections. The guidelines are likely to be reviewed and refined as Federal agencies and others gain experience with data collected under the 1997 standards. 5   CHAPTER 1 BACKGROUND This chapter discusses why guidance is needed for tabulating data collected using the 1997 standards, reiterates the general guidance issued when the standards were adopted in October 1997, provides clarification of several aspects of the standards, and presents the criteria that were developed for evaluating bridging methods and presenting data. A. Need for Tabulation Guidelines On October 30, 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published ""Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity"" (Federal Register, 62 FR 58781 - 58790)(see Appendix A). The 1997 standards reflect a change in data collection policy, making it possible for Federal agencies to collect information that reflects the increasing diversity of our Nation's population stemming from growth in interracial marriages and immigration. Under the new policy, agencies are now required to offer respondents the option of selecting one or more of the following five racial categories included in the 1997 standards: -- American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. -- Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. -- Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used in addition to ""Black or African American."" -- Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. -- White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. These five categories are the minimum set for data on race for Federal statistics, program administrative reporting, and civil rights compliance reporting. With respect to ethnicity, the standards provide for the collection of data on whether or not a person is of ""Hispanic or Latino"" culture or origin. (The standards do not permit a multiple response that would indicate an ethnic heritage that is both ""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino."") This category is defined as follows: 6   -- Hispanic or Latino. A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, ""Spanish origin,"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic or Latino."" As a result of the change in policy for collecting data on race, the reporting categories used to present these data must similarly reflect this change. In keeping with the spirit of the 1997 standards, agencies cannot collect multiple responses and then report and publish data using only the five single race categories. Agencies are expected to provide as much detail as possible on the multiple race responses, consistent with agency confidentiality and data quality criteria. As provided by the standards, OMB will consider any agency variances to this policy on a case by case basis. Based on agency research prior to the issuance of the 1997 standards, it was estimated that less than two percent of the Nation's total population was likely to identify with more than one race. This percentage may increase as those who identify with more than one racial heritage become aware of the opportunity to report more than one race. As compared with data collected on adults, data collected on children and youth, however, are likely to reflect larger numbers and percentages of respondents reporting themselves as belonging to more than one racial group. In the early years of the standards' implementation, there will be issues of data quality and confidentiality related to sample size that may restrict the amount of data that can be published for some combinations of multiple race responses. Over time, however, the size of these data cells may increase. It should be noted that such data quality and confidentiality problems for small population groups also existed under the 1977 standards, where sample sizes sometimes prevented presentation of data on certain population groups such as American Indians. The possible multiple race combinations under the 1997 standards, some with small data cells, serve to make such data quality concerns more apparent. Some balance will need to be struck between having a tabulation showing the full distribution of all possible combinations of multiple race responses and presenting only the minimum -- that is, a single aggregate of people who reported more than one race. When the standards were announced on October 30, 1997, they became effective immediately for all new and revised Federal record keeping or reporting requirements that included data on race and ethnicity. All existing Federal record keeping or reporting requirements must be made consistent with the provisions of the 1997 standards at the time they are submitted to OMB for extension through the reports clearance process, or no later than January 1, 2003. As provided by the standards, an agency must make a request to OMB for any variation from the standards. B. General Guidelines for Tabulating Data on Race In response to concerns that had been raised about how Federal agencies would tabulate multiple race responses, OMB in the October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice issued the following general guidance: 7   C  Consistent with criteria for confidentiality and data quality, the tabulation procedures used by the agencies should result in the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as possible. Guidelines for tabulation ultimately must meet the needs of at least two groups within the Federal Government, with the overriding objective of providing the most accurate and informative body of data. The first group is composed of those Federal Government officials charged with carrying out constitutional and legislative mandates, such as redistricting legislatures, enforcing civil rights laws, and monitoring progress in antidiscrimination programs. (The legislative redistricting file produced by the Bureau of the Census, also known as the Public Law 94-171 file, is an example of a file meeting such legislative needs.) The second group consists of the staff of Federal statistical agencies producing and analyzing data that are used to monitor economic and social conditions and trends. Many of the needs of the first group can be met with an initial tabulation that provides, consistent with standards for data quality and confidentiality, the full detail of racial reporting; that is, the number of people reporting in each single race category and the number reporting in each of the possible combinations of races, which would add to the total population. Depending on the judgment of users, the combinations of multiple responses could be collapsed. (1) One method would be to provide separate totals for those reporting in the most common multiple race combinations and to collapse the data for other less frequently reported combinations. The specifics of the collapsed distributions would be dependent on the results of particular data collections. (2) A second method would be to report the total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination with other races. These totals would represent upper bounds on the size of the populations who identified with each of the racial categories. In some cases, this latter method could be used for comparing data collected under the old standards with data collected under the 1997 standards.  C  C  C  C C  It is important that Federal agencies with the same or closely related responsibilities adopt consistent tabulation methods. Regardless of the method chosen for collapsing multiple race responses, Federal agencies must make available the total number reporting more than one race, if confidentiality and data quality requirements can be met, in order to ensure that any changes in response patterns resulting from the 1997 standards can be monitored over time.  8     Different tabulation procedures might be required to meet various needs of Federal agencies for data on race. Nevertheless, Federal agencies often need to compare racial and ethnic data. Hence, some standardization of tabulation categories for reporting data on race is desirable to facilitate such comparisons.  The October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice identified four areas where further research was needed on how to tabulate data: (1) How should the data be used to evaluate conformance with program objectives in the area of equal employment opportunity and other anti-discrimination programs? (2) How should the decennial census data for many small population groups with multiple racial heritages be used to develop sample designs and survey controls for major demographic surveys? (3) How should the 1997 standards be introduced in the vital statistics program which obtains the number of births and deaths from administrative records, but uses intercensal population estimates in determining the rates of births and deaths? (4) And more generally, how can meaningful comparisons be made of data collected under the previous standards and data that will be collected under the 1997 standards? In order to address these and other issues and to ensure that tabulation methodologies would be carefully developed and coordinated among the Federal agencies, OMB assembled a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from the Federal agencies that generate or use these data. This group has considered tabulation issues and developed the provisional guidance that is presented in this report for use by Federal agencies. The work of this group has included: (1) a review of Federal data needs and uses to ensure that the tabulation guidelines produce data that meet statutory and program requirements; (2) cognitive testing of the wording of questions; (3) cognitive testing of a form for reporting aggregate data; (4) evaluation of different methods of bridging from the 1997 to the 1977 standards; and (5) development of guidelines for presenting data on multiple race responses that meet accepted data quality and confidentiality standards. The tabulation guidance in this report is necessarily provisional pending the availability of Census 2000 data and other data series as the 1997 standards are implemented. These guidelines will be reviewed and modified as agencies and other data users gain experience with data collected using the 1997 standards. C. Interpretation of Self-Reported Data on Race It is important to remember that the Federal racial and ethnic data categories are social-political constructs and that they should not be interpreted as being genetic, biological, or anthropological in nature. Data on race and ethnicity have historically been collected in the decennial census, 9   but the categories for collecting and tabulating these data have changed numerous times. These changes have reflected the shifts in the racial makeup of the population and changes in social attitudes and political concerns. The standard was developed in the mid-1970's in large measure to provide comparable data to monitor equal access in areas such as housing, education, mortgage lending, health care services, and employment for population groups that historically had experienced discrimination and differential treatment because of their race or ethnicity. By using the standard to tabulate data in these areas by race and ethnicity, it is possible to compare disparities across data systems. While the Federal categories provide a standardized format for purposes of collecting and presenting data on race and ethnicity, the standard was not designed to capture the full complexity of race and ethnicity in the United States. This context is important for understanding why the Federal Government collects data on race and ethnicity and for interpreting these data. The 1997 standards emphasize self-reporting or self-identification as the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. The standards do not establish criteria or qualifications (such as blood quantum levels) that are to be used in determining a particular individual's racial or ethnic classification. They do not tell an individual who he or she is, or specify how an individual should classify himself or herself. Self-identification for race and Hispanic or Latino origin means that the responses are based on self-perception and therefore are subjective, but by definition, the responses are accurate. In situations where self-reporting is not practicable or feasible, such as identification by personnel of funeral homes, observer identification may be used. Because the 1997 standard allows individuals to report one or more races, the importance of self-identification is underscored; it is generally difficult for observers to report an individual's multiple racial heritages. As mentioned above, a consequence of using self-identification is that unless a person is purposely misreporting, there are no wrong answers even if ""objective"" clues suggest otherwise. This contrasts with the collection of information on other demographic characteristics. For example, if someone born on January 1, 1950, indicates that he or she is 30 years of age when asked on January 1, 2000, the researcher views this as an error and corrects the information. The use of self-identification coupled with the social nature of race also results in situations where an individual's response to questions on race may change over time as a result of the maturation process, the particular situation, and the changing environment. If a data collection strategy used to measure age were to produce such results, that strategy would be abandoned; in the case of race, however, such change is acceptable and expected. The dynamic nature of the concept of race and how the population views it as well as the circumstances under which the data are collected need to be considered in the interpretation and analysis of these data. An example of how the social dimension of race is incorporated into the collection of information is the large increase in the percent of the population identifying as American Indians between the 1970 and 1980 censuses. A standard interpretation of population increase focuses on the basic demographic processes of mortality, natality, and immigration. In this instance, these processes could not explain this increase. On the other hand, it would be equally wrong to 10   conclude that persons misreported their race in either 1970 or 1980. The increase reflects societal changes related to the perception of American Indian heritage and how these changes affect how individuals self-identify. Another example relates to multiple race identity. One way to define ""objectively"" a multiple race individual would be to assess the race of each of the parents. It is possible to identify a population in this way from data sets that collect information on the characteristics of family members. This approach becomes increasingly complex in situations where parents are also of multiple races, leading to questions about how much of a given racial heritage the respondent considers ""enough"" to report. Analyses show that not all persons with parents of different races identify as having more than one race. It also appears that the probability of identifying multiple races changes with the age of the individual as well as with the specific races of the parents. How individuals come to their self-identification is an important research issue that would require collection of data beyond the minimum set of categories and which would not be feasible to incorporate into all data collection systems. In interpreting and evaluating the results of analyses that are based on data collected using the 1997 standards, it is important to remember that the approach can only capture selected aspects of a complex dimension, and that what is captured will be affected by strong and complex social processes. As more detailed data are collected, and analyses that directly address these social processes are conducted, the interpretation of the information collected more routinely under the 1997 standard will be clearer. D. Points of Clarification Regarding the 1997 Standards This section elaborates on several points in the standards that have been a source of confusion for some users. Under the 1997 standards, ""Hispanic or Latino"" is clearly designated as an ethnicity and not as a race. Whether or not an individual is Hispanic or Latino, every effort should be made to ascertain the race or races with which an individual identifies. The two-question format, with the ethnicity question preceding the race question, should be used when information is collected through self-identification. Although the standards permit the use of a combined question when collecting data by observer identification, the use of the twoquestion format is strongly encouraged even where observer identification is used. Regardless of the question format, observers are expected to attempt to identify the individual's race(s). The standards require that at a minimum the total number of persons identifying with more than one race be reported. (A response that includes, for example, two or more Asian groups is not a multiple race response.) It is stressed that this is a minimum; agencies are strongly encouraged to report detailed information on specific racial combinations subject to constraints of data 11   reliability and confidentiality standards. In this regard, agencies are expected to report only those categories that meet their current reliability and confidentiality standards. Thus, the reporting of individual categories is likely to be more detailed when the overall racial distribution is reported than when characteristics by race (such as, for example, income by race ) are reported. The following wording in the standards concerning the reporting of data when the combined question is used is clarified in the paragraph below: ""In cases where data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting `Hispanic or Latino and one or more races' and the total number of respondents reporting `more than one race' (regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided."" (Section 2b of the standards) A complete tabulation of race by ethnicity should always be reported when confidentiality permits. If not, at least ethnicity by the single races and ethnicity for those reporting more than one race should be given. Thus, an Hispanic or Latino respondent reporting one race should be reported both as Hispanic or Latino and as a member of that single race. Reporting a composite - - such as the number of people who responded ""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""more than one race"" -- is a minimum that should be used only if more detailed reporting would violate data reliability and confidentiality standards. The rules discussed in Section 4 of the 1997 standards concerning the presentation of data on race and ethnicity under special circumstances are not to be invoked unilaterally by an agency. If the agency believes the standard categories are inappropriate, the agency must request a specific variance from OMB. The 1997 standards do not include an ""other race"" category. For Census 2000, OMB granted an exception to the Census Bureau to use a category called ""Some Other Race."" OMB has also granted an exception to the National Center for Health Statistics to include ""Some Other Race"" on the U.S. standard birth and death certificates in order to maintain comparability between the demographically related data systems of vital statistics and the decennial census. E. Criteria Used in Developing the Tabulation Guidelines The interagency tabulation working group generated criteria that could be used both to evaluate the technical merits of different bridging procedures (see Chapter 5 and Appendix C) and to display data under the 1997 standards. The relative importance of each criterion will depend on the purpose for which the data are intended to be used. For example, in the case of bridging to the 1977 standards, the most important criterion is ""measuring change over time,"" while ""congruence with respect to respondent's choice"" will be more critical for presenting data under the 1997 standards.  12   The criteria set forth below are designed only to assess the technical adequacy of the various statistical procedures. The first two criteria listed below are central to consideration of bridging methods. The next six criteria apply both to bridging and long-term tabulation decisions. The last criterion is of primary importance for future tabulations of data collected using the 1997 standards. Bridging: Measure change over time. This is the most important criterion for bridging because the major purpose of any historical bridge will be to measure true change over time as distinct from methodologically induced change. The ideal bridging method, under this criterion, would be one that matches how the respondent would have responded under the 1977 standards had that been possible. In this ideal situation, differences between the new distribution and the old distribution would reflect true change in the distribution itself. Minimize disruptions to the single race distribution. This criterion applies only to methods for bridging. Its purpose is to consider how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the 1997 standards. To the extent that a bridging method can meet the other criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportion in the ongoing distribution, it will facilitate looking both forward and backward in time. Bridging and future tabulations: Range of applicability. Because the purpose of the guidelines is to foster consistency across agencies in tabulating racial and ethnic data, tabulation procedures that can be used in a wide range of programs and varied contexts are usually preferable to those that have more limited applicability. Meet confidentiality and reliability standards. It is essential that the tabulations maintain the confidentiality standards of the statistical organization while producing reliable estimates. Statistically defensible. Because tabulations may be published by statistical agencies and/or provided in public use data, the recommended tabulation procedures should follow recognized statistical practices. Ease of use. Because the tabulation procedures are likely to be used in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they can be implemented with a minimum of operational difficulty. Thus, the tabulation procedures must be capable of being easily replicated by others.  13   Skill required. Similarly, it is important that the tabulation procedures can be implemented by individuals with relatively little statistical knowledge. Understandability and communicability. Again, because the tabulation procedures will likely be used, as well as presented, in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they be easily explainable to the public. Future tabulations: Congruence with respondent's choice. Because of changes in the categories and the respondent instructions accompanying the question on race (allowing one or more categories to be selected), the underlying logic of the tabulation procedures must reflect to the greatest extent possible the full detail of race reporting.  CHAPTER 2 COLLECTING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY USING THE 1997 STANDARDS This chapter provides guidelines for use by agencies in developing data collection questions, formats, and associated procedures to implement the 1997 standards. A. Developing Procedures for Data Collection An interagency committee representing the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, and the General Accounting Office conducted two phases of cognitive research to develop and test procedures to collect and aggregate data on race and ethnicity using the 1997 standards. This chapter briefly describes the research conducted by the committee and offers initial guidelines for agencies developing data collection procedures. These guidelines will be continually reviewed and modified as implementation of the 1997 standards occurs, feedback from agencies is received, and new research findings become available. The guidelines in this chapter address the wording and format of questions that ask for self-reported data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin as well as the design of forms that collect aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin. Instructions and training procedures for field interviewers and administrative personnel who will be using these questions and forms are also discussed. 1. Developing and Testing Self-Reported Race and Ethnicity Questions A goal of this research was to provide guidance on the wording and format of questions for selfreported race and Hispanic or Latino origin, depending on the data collection mode. The interagency committee conducted research on survey questions administered by telephone or in  14   face-to-face personal interviews. In addition, the Census Bureau conducted extensive research on the design of questions in preparation for Census 2000. Both short and long versions of questions were tested. For short versions of the race question, the five minimum response categories were usedthey are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Long versions of the race question provided for reporting of subgroups such as Chinese, Japanese, Samoan, and so forth. For Hispanic or Latino origin questions, the minimum level of detail used was a Yes or No response indicating Hispanic or Latino origin background. Long versions of the question provided for reporting of subgroups such as Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Mexican. Below is a brief description of the methods used in the two phases of research conducted by the interagency committee followed by the results and their implications. This section concludes with general guidelines to use in collecting self-reported data on race and ethnicity and offers specific examples of question wording and format. Research Methods. In Phase I, 44 cognitive laboratory interviews were completed, 33 face-toface and 11 by telephone. Interviews were conducted in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Subjects were grouped for analysis purposes according to their reports of the race of their mother and father. Among the 44 subjects, 15 reported both parents as Black or African American, 10 reported both parents as White, 2 reported both parents as Asian, 2 reported both parents as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 2 reported both parents as American Indian or Alaska Native, 6 reported their mother's race as different from their father's race, and 7 reported some other response (e.g., Hispanic or country of origin). Of the 6 subjects who reported multiple race backgrounds, 3 reported American Indian or Alaska Native in combination with either Black or African American or White, 2 reported Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander in combination with either Asian or White, and 1 reported Asian and White. Ten of the 44 subjects were of Hispanic or Latino origin. In Phase II, a total of 82 cognitive interviews were conducted in four locations: New York, NY; Tulsa, OK; Sacramento, CA; and Honolulu, HI. Half of the interviews tested items designed for face-to-face surveys and the remaining half tested items designed for telephone administration. As in Phase I, subjects in Phase II were grouped for analysis purposes according to their reports of the race(s) of their mother and father. One of the purposes of the Phase II research was to test race and ethnicity questions specifically with subjects who were Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and of multiple race backgrounds. Among the 82 subjects, 17 subjects reported their parents as Hispanic; these subjects were not further categorized by race for analysis purposes. Sixteen reported both parents as Asian, 16 reported both parents as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 14 reported both parents as American Indian or Alaska Native, and19 reported their mother's race as different from their father's race. During the cognitive interviews, subjects were probed extensively about their racial and ethnic backgrounds. Based on this information, among the 19 subjects reporting more than one race, 5 were American Indian and White, 3 were Black and 15   White, 3 were American Indian or Alaska Native, Black, and White, 2 were Asian and White, 2 were American Indian or Alaska Native and Black, 2 were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and Asian, 1 was Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and White, and 1 was Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, and White. All research subjects were asked general demographic questions (e.g., age, education, and marital status) as well as the test versions of questions on Hispanic or Latino origin and race. Respondents were also asked to provide proxy data for all members of their household. Then, debriefings were conducted to learn more about the subjects' understanding of the questions and terms used. Findings. Generally, subjects were able to answer without difficulty the race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared. However, individual differences were found in the interpretation and meaning of terms used and there was obvious confusion among some subjects regarding the separation of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. In debriefings, some subjects who were of Hispanic or Latino origin said they usually report Hispanic (or some variation indicating Hispanic status or country of origin) when answering surveys or government forms that ask race. As expected, subjects who were interviewed face-to-face seemed to use and rely on the flashcards to select a response. Subjects interviewed by telephone had more difficulty answering the race question and the long version of the Hispanic question since they had to listen to a relatively long list of response options. There was some indication that hearing a list with alternative terms representing one category (i.e., Black or African American is one category, not two) may result in confusion. A few subjects thought the interviewer asked them to choose between Black or African American and commented that they did not like having to make a choice. This problem can be addressed through interviewer training that teaches the interviewer to pause longer after saying each response category; that is, if the interviewer is reading a list of ""...White, Black or African American, Asian, ..."" she/he should pause between the words White and Black, not pause between Black or African American, and pause again between African American and Asian. Last, there was some evidence that hearing the instruction to ""Select one or more..."" was misunderstood on the telephone to mean that the subject had to select more than one race. Interviewers will need to be trained to perceive and correct for this. Implications. As has been noted elsewhere in the literature, respondents often do not make clear distinctions among the terms and concepts used in defining race, ethnicity, nationality, and ancestry. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared but individual differences in the interpretation and meaning of terms used were found, as was confusion regarding the distinction of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. The following statements from the cognitive interviews illustrate these findings.  16   C  It means ethnic background. Not the country. I think people tend to cross quickly between using the terms race and country. When I say, ""Yes, I am Hawaiian,"" I mean that in my bloodstream I have Hawaii. My blood inheritance. Race I guess means the color somebody is. Or, their cultural heritage. The word race means the biological heritage from which you descend. Race means the culture that someone is from. The way I think of race, I think of it as a negative, probably because of what we've read about in the 60's--race riots, etc. It always seems to have a negative connotation. I prefer to use ethnicity. I answer differently sometimes, depending on what's beneficial to my family or me. Sometimes you see Hispanic as a choice for race. If Hispanic had been offered as a race then I would have chosen that. The race question is difficult because it doesn't have enough categories, it's too restrictive. With only five categories, there are two that are too specific--American Indian and Native Hawaiian--and there's a list of countries for the Asians. It doesn't specify anything about Central or South American descent. Everybody comes from different backgrounds; even White Americans can probably check off Irish, etc.  C C C C  C C C  General Guidelines. Based on work accomplished by the interagency committee as well as the testing of questions in a variety of modes and with subjects of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, the following guidelines and examples for the design of questions on race and ethnicity are offered: C Communicate clearly an instruction that allows, but does not require, multiple responses to the race question. The 1997 standards are clear that the format and wording used in a question on race must communicate to the respondent an instruction that multiple responses are acceptable. Based on research findings, the recommended forms for this instruction are Select one or more, Mark one or more, or Choose one or more. There was some limited research indicating that the wording ""...one or more..."" was better understood than a ""Mark all that apply"" alternative. Other instructions may be needed, especially when integrating a race question within an existing data collection instrument. For example, some mail instruments do not word questions in a personal way; that is, rather than What is your age? an instrument may simply have Age with a line for an entry. Taking this case further, if a form has an item simply worded as Race with a line for an entry, then an instruction should be included to 17   communicate that multiple race responses are acceptable (e.g., Race - enter one or more). Regardless of exact wording, the instruction must be evident to the respondent. C Consider using an instruction to answer both the question on Hispanic or Latino origin question and the question on race. Using an instruction has particular relevance for mail surveys or questionnaires that are selfadministered since there is no opportunity for interviewer interaction. An instruction such as the following that was used in Census 2000 may improve potential item non-response, especially among Hispanic respondents: NOTE: Please answer BOTH Questions 4 and 5 (Hispanic or Latino and Race). C For data collection efforts requiring detailed Hispanic or Latino origin or detailed race information, consider a two-part question or follow-up questions asked by the interviewer or printed on a form. For example, respondents who first report being of Hispanic or Latino origin would then be asked if they are Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and so forth. Take mode of administration carefully into account when designing questions and instructions. This guideline may seem obvious but it is often the case that surveys are conducted using more than one mode (i.e., the initial interview attempt may be a personal visit but a telephone interview is permissible). Since the questions should be designed with the mode in mind, there may need to be different versions of questions, depending on the mode of administration. C Provide definitions to the minimum race categories when possible. This guideline is particularly relevant when the short version (only the five minimum categories) of a question on race is used. Individual interpretation of the five categories could lead to response error, especially for respondents unsure of the definitions of Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander. For self-administered forms, providing the definition of the category should be considered if space and formatting limitations can be overcome. For interviewer-administered questions, the definitions should be readily available to the interviewer (usually in a manual that provides question-byquestion specifications or a pop-up screen if the interview is computer-assisted) to assist the respondent if needed.  C  18   C  Adhere to the specific terminology for the racial and ethnic categories as stated in the 1997 standards. The 1997 standards address the words and terms to use, and also indicate other terms that can be considered. For example, the title of the previous Black category should be revised to Black or African American and additional terms such as Haitian or Negro can be used if desired. In another example, American Indian should be used and Native American should not be substituted for American Indian. Reviewing the terms specified in the revised standards is strongly encouraged before designing questions on race and Hispanic or Latino origin.  Specific Guidelines on Question Wording and Format. The examples below are based on numerous discussions with interagency committee members, recommendations by questionnaire design experts, and testing results from both the interagency committee's research as well as research conducted by the Census Bureau in preparation for Census 2000. It is important to remember that other variations of questions on ethnicity and race may work just as well or better in a particular survey or data collection environment. There is not ""one right way"" to ask an individual to report his/her race and ethnicity. Rather, question wording and format should depend on the mode of administration as well as the context in which the questions are being asked. For ease of reference, the following list first provides examples for use in a face-to-face or personal visit mode of data collection, followed by telephone and then self-administration (usually thought of as a mail survey, but also could be used for forms and applications filled out by an individual). There are examples of questions that ask Hispanic or Latino origin as well as questions that ask for reports of race. It is important to recognize that as agencies implement the 1997 revised standards, more will be learned about which question formats work best. Thus, OMB does not at this time recommend one example of question wording or format over another. Also, OMB does not recommend a particular order of categories. There are advantages and disadvantages to various approaches such as an alphabetic ordering versus the ordering of the most prevalent group followed by groups less prevalent. The ordering shown reflects the ordering used in the testing of these questions.

Developing and Testing Aggregate Reporting Forms Implementing the 1997 standards will cause fundamental changes to the ways in which data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin have previously been aggregated and reported. As a result, a second goal of the interagency committee's research is to provide guidance on the design of reporting forms that will be used by administrative personnel to aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin for a given population (e.g., reporting race and ethnicity for a school population). Initial research efforts. Three different types of forms were tested with eighteen subjects who were familiar with reporting aggregate data for a given population, but not necessarily familiar with the 1997 standards. Of the 18 respondents interviewed, 6 worked for the Federal Government, 8 worked in private industry, 3 worked in local correctional facilities, and 1 worked in a school. None of the forms tested were completed accurately without interviewer intervention. Regardless of the form tested or whether the testing was conducted in a laboratory or on-site, the most common problem was the requirement to count and report race for individuals who are of Hispanic or Latino origin. As an illustration, one subject stated ""It's (the form) basically asking how Hispanics were separated into groups of races. I think the part that confuses me is that our Hispanics do not view themselves as another race. And so that is kind of what threw me off... it's asking for Hispanics who had marked `White,' but they don't. They would have checked Hispanic."" Discussions with subjects revealed that all but one worked for agencies that have used a single question -- a combined race and ethnicity format -- to collect data. Rather than continuing the testing of different draft forms, work shifted in FY 2000 to establishing guidance for Federal enforcement agencies that collect, use, and/or report aggregate data on race. This work culminated in the March 9, 2000, issuance of OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, Guidance on Aggregation and Allocation of Data on Race for Use in Civil Rights Monitoring 24   and Enforcement (see Chapter 4 for further discussion on the implementation of this bulletin). The aggregation method described in the bulletin keeps intact the five single race categories and includes the four double race combinations most frequently reported in recent studies. The method also provides for the collection of information on any multiple race combinations that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest. A balance category is provided to aggregate and report those individual responses that are not included in (1) one of the five single race categories or four double race combinations or (2) other combinations that represent more than one percent of the population in a jurisdiction. Appendix B contains the bulletin and an example agencies could use to design aggregate reporting forms. Guidelines. Even though there were many problems found in developing and testing aggregate forms, the following initial guidelines can be offered:  If possible (notwithstanding confidentiality and disclosure issues), allow for the reporting of every combination of multiple race responses. If every combination cannot be reported because of burden and/or confidentiality concerns, include at a minimum the following 10 categories described in Bulletin 0002.            American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of individuals reporting more than one race    If the categories described in Bulletin 00-02 are used, also include to the greatest extent possible any aggregate counts of multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population of interest or study. Provide definitions that assist in understanding the concepts of single race responses and multiple race responses as well as the distinction between ethnicity and race. Explain how the missing data should be reported. Design the form in a professional manner and include clear instructions.      25     When feasible, consider providing information to respondents about how multiple race responses will be aggregated and reported to a Federal enforcement agency. For example, employers may want to include on employment applications the following information: Below are two questions--the first is about your ethnicity and the second your race. You are to answer both questions. In answering the second question, you may select one or more races. The summarized information is reported to the Federal Government for civil rights enforcement purposes. The summarized information will be reported in the following categories only: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. White Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Black or African American and White Asian and White American Indian or Alaska Native and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of all other individuals selecting more than one race.  If you select races that are not in categories 1 through 9 above, you will be counted in 10, which is the balance of all other individuals selecting more than one race. For example, if you select Asian and Black and White, your race will be reported in the balance category.  3. Developing Field Instructions and Training Procedures Work to develop interviewer instructions and interviewer training procedures has only recently begun. Long-term plans include developing and testing different training modules and interviewer instructions, depending on the mode of administration and the type of data collection. This work will, in all likelihood, address in a more systematic way some longstanding issues in the fielding of questions on race and ethnicity and ways that interviewers can be trained to improve data quality. Specific procedures on how to ask the questions and, in some cases, how to instruct the respondent to use the flashcard, will be developed along with suggested interviewer probes, definitions, and statements that can be used to address respondent problems. During the cognitive testing of the race and ethnicity questions, interviewer training and field procedures were also tested. Specifically, interviewers were trained to administer the questions in a standardized manner as would be done in actual survey interviews. (Cognitive probing was conducted after the questions were administered.) As is common in actual surveys, the interviewers were also supplied with a ""Question and Answer"" sheet to assist in responding to questions and confusion on the part of respondents.  26   The interviewers experienced the greatest difficulty in assisting Hispanic or Latino respondents who were having trouble answering the question on race. If a respondent answered ""I'm Hispanic or Latino"" (or some other term for Hispanic), the interviewers were trained to point the respondent back to the race categories by responding with something like ""In addition to being Hispanic, can you describe yourself as [repeat race categories]?"" Also, if a respondent insisted that Hispanic or Latino was a race or asked why it wasn't on the list of races, the interviewer was trained to say that ""Hispanic or Latino is generally considered an ethnicity rather than a raceHispanic or Latino persons can be of any race."" This study found these kinds of interviewer explanations to be mostly ineffective and in fact, some respondents found them to be offensive. The research team concluded that interviewers should rely on standard probing techniques to encourage respondents to place their answer into an explicit response category, and to repeat the categories if necessary. Clearly, more research is needed in this area as the 1997 standards become more widely implemented. B. Processing Census 2000 Data Using the 1997 Standards This section provides an overview of the procedures the Census Bureau is following in editing responses to the Census 2000 race and Hispanic origin questions and imputing responses to these questions for people who did not provide them. A comparison of these procedures with those implemented in the 1990 census is shown at the end of this section. The process can be divided into five parts: pre-editing procedures, within-household imputation, ""hot deck"" imputation, substitution, and group quarters editing. The basic philosophy in performing editing and imputation operations is that the Census Bureau has enough subjectmatter expertise and access to related information provided by the respondent, by others in the respondent's household, or by other people similar to the respondent to make reasonable imputations of missing responses. In cases where answers are not responsive to the question, they are removed and new responses are imputed. As part of its effort to inform the public about data quality, the Census Bureau publishes the degree to which it imputes responses for each question. In addition, the Census Bureau indicates in its microdata files which responses for a given record have been imputed. A certain amount of editing of responses occurs during coding operations, which precede the implementation of formal editing and imputation procedures. For example, during the coding of write-in responses to the question on race, coders must determine how national origin or ethnic group responses, such as Jamaican and German, should be coded into racial categories. The Census Bureau developed an approach for assigning race codes to responses that represent national origins or ethnic groups (excluding American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, Asian  27   subgroups, and Pacific Islander groups) and the results of this approach are reflected in the race code list and in the coding procedures.1 1. Pre-editing Procedures Purpose: To convert input codes into standard three-digit output codes, detect and correct outof-range values, ensure that no more than eight2 race codes appear on the edited file, and resolve into one code multiple responses given to the question on Hispanic origin. (Please note that all original responses are preserved on the unedited files.) Tasks: Race  The pre-editing procedures include the following operations to assign three-digit codes for responses to this question:     Convert check box marks into corresponding three-digit codes; Ensure that write-in codes obtained from the coding operations are valid;3 Eliminate duplicate codes; and Remove general codes when more specific codes are provided (for example, if the check box code for American Indian and Alaska Native and a code for a tribe are present, the check box code is eliminated).  Data on single ancestry by race from the 1990 census were used to help make decisions about how to code these responses into racial categories. Essentially, if 90 percent or more of people who reported a single, specific ancestry reported in a specific race category in 1990 (for example, 97 percent of people indicating Jamaican ancestry reported as Black in the question on race), then that race is used as the Census 2000 response. This 90percent rule was not applied to write-in responses of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, Asian groups, or Pacific Islander groups because the question on race was designed explicitly to obtain these types of responses. Although it is possible for more than eight race codes to be input during data processing (including coding), no more than eight race codes are kept on the edited files that are used for data products. For example, people may provide multiple ethnic responses (such as German, Italian, Jamaican, and Nigerian) in addition to multiple check box responses and write-in responses of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes or Asian and Pacific Islander groups, possibly resulting in eight or more input race codes. Results from the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal show that of people reporting more than one race, the overwhelming majority report only two races. Thus, storing up to eight race codes in the output files preserves, as much as possible, the original groups reported. In rare cases, invalid codes may have been applied inadvertently to a particular write-in response. Although extensive efforts are made to identify and correct these situations, the editing procedures act as a backup system for resolving any remaining problems. 3 2  1  28   The pre-editing procedures then ensure that no more to the edited file. The goal in this process is to retain American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and about groups while, at the same time, preserving reporting White, Black, and Some other race. Hispanic origin  than eight race codes are sent as output as much information as possible about detailed Asian and Pacific Islander of all other major racial groups such as  Pre-editing procedures for the Hispanic origin question are considerably simpler because there is only one write-in space and respondents are not asked to report multiple origins. The philosophy of the procedures, however, is similar to that for the race question. Some specific examples include:    Convert check box marks into corresponding three-digit codes; Ensure that write-in codes are valid; Override the general code for the ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino"" check box with the specific code for any origin that is written in. For example, the code for a write-in response of ""Guatemalan"" (code 222) replaces the check box code for ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/ Latino"" (code 280); and Reduce multiple check boxes marked for a respondent to one output code.4    For research purposes, all responses, including reporting of multiple responses, are retained . 2. Within-Household Imputation Purpose: When race or Hispanic origin data are missing, to impute responses for people from others within the same household who have reported race or Hispanic origin. Tasks: This part of the editing procedures is performed jointly for the race and Hispanic origin questions. They involve the following steps:  Identify people in the household for whom no response was given to either or both the Hispanic origin question and the race question;  If more than one response was given, obtaining a single response will be achieved as follows: (1) If all the responses are Hispanic, the respondent will be assigned as ""Other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."" (2) If all the responses are not Hispanic, the respondent will be assigned as ""Not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."" (3) If the responses are a mix of Hispanic and non-Hispanic responses, the responses will be blanked and a single origin will be imputed either, first, from within the household or, if no one in the household gave a single response, from other neighboring households with members of the same race.  4  29      Search to see if an Hispanic origin response can be obtained from a write-in response to the question on race; and Search to see if a race response can be obtained from a write-in response to the question on Hispanic origin  After these preliminary steps, the within-household editing procedures follow one of three paths using a predetermined sequence of household relationship to assign race and origin depending on whether both race and origin are blank, only race is blank, or only origin is blank.5 If both race and origin are blank, the race and origin values assigned will come from the first person in that predetermined sequence with a value for race and/or origin. If only one value is obtained, the procedures for imputing only race (or only origin) are followed. If only race is blank, the race value is assigned from the first person in that predetermined sequence with the same reported origin group. If only Hispanic origin is blank, the origin value is assigned from the first person in that sequence with the same reported race group. If race and/or origin cannot be assigned from anyone within the household, then a response is assigned from a ""hot deck."" (See the next section.) 3. ""Hot Deck"" Imputation Purpose: When race and Hispanic origin data are missing from all household records, an origin or race will be assigned from other Census records in surrounding blocks (or nearby households) with ""similar"" characteristics. A hot deck is a data table (or ""matrix"") in which values of reported responses (donors), stratified by selected characteristics of the respondents, are stored and updated on a flow basis and used as needed to assign values of the variable in question to people with similar characteristics who do not have a response. In the case of race, the assignment from the ""donor"" can be a single or multiple race. Each cell in this table is a ""stack"" of sixteen stored values that are constantly updated as each household is processed, with the most recently reported value being the first one available for use. Thus, if race cannot be assigned for an individual from within the household, a race is assigned from the first available value in the hot deck ""stack"" based on age and origin. This value will come from a ""donor"" with similar age and origin who will have a high likelihood of living nearby, perhaps even next door. Sixteen values are stored in each cell to guard against having to assign the same stored value over and over again if several people in a row with the same characteristics require a hot deck allocation.  For example, if only race is needed to be imputed for the child of the householder, the editing procedures would look in the household for the person with a race reported and with the same origin as the child. Records would be searched in the following priority sequence: householder, another child, and spouse of householder.  5  30   Tasks: In the race/Hispanic origin editing procedures, there are seven hot deck allocation matrices. Three of them are concerned with allocating both a race and an origin. All three matrices are stratified by three broad age groups (15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older) and focus solely on assigning race and origin to the householder. Use of these matrices occurs when no one in the household has either a reported race or a reported origin. The race and origin assigned to the householder will also be assigned to all other members of the household. Each matrix has a different universe of ""donors."" The universe for the first matrix will be donors with Spanish surnames (that is, only householders with Spanish surnames are used to update this matrix). The universe for the second matrix will be donors with non-Spanish surnames. The universe for the third matrix will be donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish, or who have not provided a surname on the census form. The remaining four hot deck matrices assign either race or origin. They are all stratified by four broad age groups (0-14, 15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older). The one matrix that assigns race alone is further stratified by seven origin groups (Not Hispanic and six Hispanic groups: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central American/Dominican, Latin/South American, and Other Hispanic). The three remaining matrices that assign origin alone are stratified by six race groups (White, Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and Some other race). The universes for the three origin hot deck matrices are, respectively: donors with a Spanish surname, donors with a non-Spanish surname, and donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. 4. Substitution Purpose: To assign characteristics for members of occupied housing units for which there is nothing but a count of people and there are no characteristics reported for anyone in the housing unit. Tasks: For housing units that are not vacant but for which there are no data, the Census Bureau uses a hot deck technique called ""substitution"" to assign characteristics (including race and origin) to the people in the housing unit. The assignment of characteristics is achieved through the use of a substitution hot deck matrix which contains ""cells"" of characteristics for reported households and is stratified according to the type of enumeration method used (mail out/mail back or enumerator) and the number of people in the household. These cells are updated using the characteristics of the most recently reported household of the specified enumeration method and size. As with the other hot deck matrices, each cell stores information for eight households and these cells are constantly being refreshed as new households enter the editing program and are eligible to update the matrix.  31   5. Group Quarters Editing Purpose: To assign characteristics to people in group quarters. Tasks: A separate editing procedure is used for the group quarters population. This editing procedure is necessarily different from the household editing procedure because, in general, people in group quarters are not related to each other and assigning values for members of households depends in some way on household relationships. For people who do not report an origin, the group quarters editing procedure first searches to see if an Hispanic origin can be obtained from a write-in response to the race question. If not, a group quarters hot deck matrix is used. Each hot deck matrix for assigning origin is stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and by race, using the same six race categories as those used in the household hot decks. There are three hot deck matrices for origin: (a) one with donors having a Spanish surname, (b) one with donors having a non-Spanish surname, and (c) one with donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. If race is not reported, it will be assigned from the race group quarters hot deck matrix. The hot deck matrix is stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and by origin (non-Hispanic and six Hispanic groups). The seven origin groups are the same as those used in the household hot decks. If both origin and race are missing, they are assigned jointly from one of three race/origin group quarters hot decks: (a) one with donors having a Spanish surname, (b) one with donors having a non-Spanish surname, or (c) one with donors whose names are not clearly either Spanish or not Spanish or who have not provided a surname on the census form. These matrices are similar to the joint race/origin hot deck matrices used in the household editing and they are stratified by type of group quarters (13 types) and age (0-14, 15-34, 35-54, and 55 and older).  32   Differences Between Census 2000 and 1990 Procedures for Editing Responses to the Questions on Race and Hispanic Origin Census 2000 RACE Reporting more than one race Reporting more than one race allowed Maximum of eight race codes retained.

Evaluating Census 2000 Data on Race For many census data users, both governmental and non-governmental and the private sector, there is a need to understand how the Census 2000 race distributions relate to race distributions from previous censuses and current surveys. Adoption of the 1997 standards resulted in a number of changes in the number and names of racial categories and in the sequencing of questions on ethnicity and race. For the 1990 census there were four racial categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander), whereas for Census 2000 there were five racial categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). In the 1990 census, the question on race preceded the question on Hispanic origin with two intervening questions. For Census 2000, the question on Hispanic origin was immediately before the question on race with a note to respondents to answer both questions. The most profound change to the standards, however, was that of allowing respondents to report more than one race if they chose to do so. Data by race from most Federal surveys currently reflect a collection methodology of asking respondents to mark only one racial category. Users of the Census 2000 data on race will need to compare the race distribution from Census 2000 to these other sources. To provide data users with a mechanism to make meaningful comparisons of data collected under the 1977 standards with data that are collected under the 1997 standards, the Census Bureau is undertaking two research projects. The first study was part of the Census 2000 data collection efforts. In Census 2000, an experimental panel of 10,000 housing units replicated the 1990 questions on race and Hispanic origin in the 1990 sequence and used the Census 2000 short form as a control panel. Data from the experimental and control panels will be used to evaluate the combined effects of the changes in question wording, format, content, and design on the quality and content of the data on race. The second study is currently being planned and is expected to be fielded in summer 2001. In this study, data from Census 2000 will be used to identify households where two or more races were reported for at least one respondent, using both short- and-long form households; differential sampling will be used to ensure that households receiving the long form are over sampled. Stratification and differential allocation of the sample to the strata will be explored to increase the precision of the estimates. Stratification will be based on Census 2000 data on such variables as age, Hispanic origin, race, tenure, and urban and rural geographic concentration. Other pertinent information obtained from an analysis of Census 2000 data on race and from external experts will also be considered in the sample design phase. A split panel design will be used; half of the sample households will be mailed a questionnaire that asks respondents to report a single race, while the other half will be asked to report one or more races. Much like in Census 2000, non-response follow up will be conducted for households that fail to return the questionnaire. To the extent possible, households that have moved since completing the Census 2000 questionnaires will be traced. Results from the respondents will be matched to their Census 2000 responses. Additionally, a follow-up interview will be conducted to ascertain 34   relevant information to help understand the reporting behavior of respondents who reported two or more races and are now being asked to report a single race or vice versa. Background information on single race respondents will also be obtained. It is expected that reliable estimates that replicate Census 2000 will be produced for the single race distribution and for the five most frequent combinations of two or more races (White and Black; White and American Indian and Alaska Native; White and Asian; Black and American Indian and Alaska Native; and Black and Asian) at the national level. Synthetic modeling is expected to produce reliable estimates at the state and lower geographic levels. Like the Census Bureau, other Federal agencies also have plans to evaluate data on race collected using the 1997 standards. Future updates of this guidance will include descriptions of these research projects and, if available, will summarize the research results.  35   CHAPTER 3 TABULATING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY COLLECTED USING THE 1997 STANDARDS This chapter describes plans for tabulating data on race and ethnicity collected under the 1997 standards to meet various Federal needs for these data. A. Census 2000 Data The Census 2000 questionnaire provided individuals the opportunity to self-report their racial identity by selecting one or more races. For purposes of Census 2000, in an effort to encourage response to this question and to provide the opportunity to gather data on extremely small groups, OMB approved the use of a sixth category -- Some Other Race -- in addition to the minimum set of five racial categories. This discussion covers tabulation plans for the six categories of race and the two categories of ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino) and for possible combinations of these racial and ethnic categories. It does not address tabulation plans that are being developed for detailed groups of American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic populations for which information was collected in Census 2000. 1. Protection of Data Confidentiality To maintain confidentiality as required by law (Title 13, United States Code), the Census Bureau uses a confidentiality edit to ensure that published data do not disclose information about specific individuals or households. The result is that a small amount of uncertainty is introduced into census data for small geographic areas to prevent identification of specific individuals or households. As with data from the 1990 census, a confidentiality edit will be implemented for data from Census 2000 by selecting a sample of census households from internal census files and interchanging their data with data from other households that have identical numbers of household members, but that are in different locations. The net result of this procedure is that the data user's ability to obtain census data is increased, particularly for small geographic areas and small population groups. 2. Plans for Tabulations by Race and Ethnicity The plans reflect OMB's preliminary guidelines (See Chapter 1, Section B) on tabulations by race and ethnicity. This discussion of the plans covers the presentation of data on both population totals for racial and ethnic categories and on population characteristics (e.g., age, sex,  36   educational attainment, labor force status, occupation, and income) for racial and ethnic categories. Before describing these plans for tabulations by race and ethnicity, it is helpful to describe the maximum number of racial and/or ethnic categories for which data could be provided. There are 63 potential single and multiple race categories -- 6 categories for those who marked exactly one race and 57 categories for those who marked two or more races. These 57 categories of two or more races include the 15 possible combinations of two races (for example, Asian and White), the 20 possible combinations of three races, the 15 possible combinations of four races, the 6 possible combinations of five races, and the 1 possible combination of all six races. There are two ethnic categories (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Thus there are 126 categories (63 x 2) in which the population could be classified by both race and ethnicity. The 63 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories of race may be collapsed down to 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories by combining the 57 categories of two or more races. These 7 categories are: White alone, Black or African American alone, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Asian alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, Some other race alone, and Two or more races. Alternative groupings for tabulations by race reflect OMB's preliminary guidelines to show ""the total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination."" In combination literally means ""in combination with one or more other races."" In this ""all-inclusive"" approach, tabulations will be shown for each of six categories, which will overlap and will add to more than the total population to the extent that individuals report more than one race. These six categories are: White alone or in combination, Black or African American alone or in combination, American Indian and Alaska Native alone or in combination, Asian alone or in combination, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone or in combination, and Some other race alone or in combination. As in the case of the 63 racial categories, both tabulations by race of the 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories and tabulations by race alone or in combination could be classified by ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Because of concerns about the usefulness and reliability of data on population characteristics for small populations, about issues with respect to confidentiality, and about providing data products so voluminous that most data cell values would be zero, the Census Bureau is planning (as it has in previous censuses) to present more geographic detail by race and ethnicity for population totals than for population characteristics (e.g., age, sex, housing tenure, education, and income). (The term population characteristics is used here to include both population and housing characteristics. The characteristics of occupied housing units by race and ethnicity are classified  37   based on the race and ethnicity of the householder.) Specific plans concerning data on population totals and population characteristics by race and ethnicity are discussed later. 3. Overview of Plans for Data Products The Census Bureau plans to release a variety of data products from Census 2000 in three different media: Internet, CD-ROM, and paper. These data products will include 100-percent data (based on information collected on all questionnaires, such as age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin) and sample data (based on information collected only on long-form questionnaires, such as education, occupation, and income). Population totals by race and ethnicity are based on 100-percent data, whereas some population characteristics by race and ethnicity are based on 100-percent and some on sample data. The presentation of data by race and ethnicity planned for eight different aggregated data products and for microdata files is discussed below in detail. The eight aggregated data products are: (1) Census 2000 Redistricting Data Summary File (100-percent data) (2) Demographic Profile (100-percent and sample data on population characteristics for the total population, but no characteristics data by race or ethnicity) (3) Summary File 1 (100-percent data) (4) Summary File 2 (100-percent data) (5) Quick Tables (100-percent data and sample data) (6) Census 2000: Summary Population and Housing Characteristics (100-percent data) (7) Summary File 3 (sample data) (8) Summary File 4 (sample data) Plans for aggregated tabulations by race and ethnicity are discussed in the following two sections, first for 100-percent data on population totals and characteristics and then for sample data on population characteristics. Microdata files are discussed in the last section. 4. 100-Percent Data on Population Totals and Characteristics by Race and Ethnicity Census 2000 Redistricting Data Summary File (100-percent data). This file is referred to hereafter as the PL 94-171 file, by which name it is commonly known. Public Law 94-171 requires that the Census Bureau work closely with the ""officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting of each state"" to determine the specific tabulations needed from the decennial census. Tabulations planned for this file are based on meetings and communications with the Redistricting Task Force of the National Conference of State Legislatures and state-appointed liaisons of the governors and legislatures. During this process, senior officials from OMB, the Voting Rights Section of the Department of Justice, and the Census Bureau consulted with the Task Force and state legislative officials.  38   As described earlier, a confidentiality edit will be used in Census 2000, as was done in the 1990 census. Thus, as in 1990, there will be no data suppression, and there will be many data cells in the PL 94-171 file with very small values (e.g., zero, one, or two). The PL 94-171 file will include population totals down to the block level for the 63 racial categories described earlier, along with subtotals for the population of one race, for two or more races, and for each combination of two races, three races, four races, five races, and six races. The PL 94-171 file will include four matrices (one-dimensional statistical tables). The first matrix will show the racial categories just described. The second matrix will show the total Hispanic or Latino population and the racial categories for the population that is Not Hispanic or Latino. The racial and ethnic categories included in these two matrices are shown in Table 1. The third and fourth matrices will repeat the first and second matrices, but limited to the population 18 years and older. From the data that will be presented on the PL 94-171 File, it will be possible to derive population totals for a race alone or in combination (by addition) and for the Hispanic or Latino population by race (by subtraction). The PL 94-171 file will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Demographic Profile (100-percent data). For geographic areas down to the census tract level, the Demographic Profile is designed to provide an overview of 100-percent census data that includes all population and housing topics for which data were collected on a 100-percent basis: sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household relationship, and housing occupancy and tenure. Given the limited amount of space to show data on each topic, population totals by race and ethnicity will be limited, and data on population characteristics will be limited to the total population. Population totals will be shown for each of the six races alone, for two or more races, and for each major race alone or in combination (as described earlier), but will not be shown for the 57 specific categories of two or more races. The population total will be shown also for the Hispanic or Latino population. The Demographic Profile will be available on the Internet and CD-ROM and will be available also on paper for governmental units (including states, counties, incorporated places, American Indian and Alaska Native Areas, and Hawaiian Home Lands). Summary File 1 (100-percent data). For population totals, data shown down to the block level on the PL 94-171 File (including all 63 racial categories) will be repeated on Summary File 1 (SF-1). Data on population characteristics will be shown on SF-1 for the total population and for nine racial or ethnic groups. In some cases characteristics will be shown down to the block level and in other cases down to the census tract level. The ten groups for which population characteristics will be shown are:  39   (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)  Total White alone Black or African American alone American Indian and Alaska Native alone Asian alone Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone Some other race alone Two or more races Hispanic or Latino (of any race) White alone, not Hispanic or Latino  SF-1 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Summary File 2 (100-percent data). Summary File 2 (SF-2) will show data on population characteristics, subject to a population threshold, down to the census tract level for a large number of groups. As shown in Table 2, these groups include the 63 racial categories, two or more races, the six races alone or in combination, Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino for race alone and for race alone or in combination. The population threshold for SF-2 is 100. If the population of a racial or ethnic group is less than 100 in a geographic area (e.g., a county or a census tract), population characteristics for that group for that geographic area will not be included on SF-2. (Even if population characteristics for a specific group in a specific geographic area are not available on SF-2, the population total will be available on SF-1.) SF-2 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Quick Tables (100-percent data). Quick Tables (referred to as Table Shells in the Draft Provisional Guidance of 2/17/99) represent a new data product for Census 2000. Each Quick Table is designed to print on one page (from the Internet) and has a fixed table boxhead and table stub (e.g., showing population by age and sex). The Quick Tables, which correspond generally to tables in detailed printed report series from the 1990 census, are supported by the summary files (just as summary tape files supported detailed printed report series in 1990). Quick tables show less data than are available in summary files, but in a more user-friendly format, including more derived measures such as percent distributions. Quick Tables will be available down to the census tract level and will show extensive 100-percent data by race and ethnicity, subject to a population threshold of 100, including population characteristics for racial and ethnic groups included in SF-1 and SF-2. Quick tables will be available on the Internet. Census 2000 Summary Population and Housing Characteristics (100-percent data). This is a printed report series (one report per state and a national summary report) that is designed to provide an overview of 100-percent data in a format that facilitates comparison across geographic areas (e.g., all counties in a state). As with the Demographic Profile, some 40   population totals will be presented by race and ethnicity, as shown in Table 3, but data on population characteristics will be limited to the total population with the following two exceptions. Data on population characteristics will be shown for the American Indian and Alaska Native population in American Indian and Alaska Native Areas and for the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander population in Hawaiian Home Lands. This printed report series, which corresponds closely to the 1990 census printed report series on Summary Population and Housing Characteristics, will show data in state reports for counties, county subdivisions, and places (both incorporated and unincorporated). Census 2000 Summary Population and Housing Characteristics will be a printed report series. 5. Sample Data on Population Characteristics by Race and Ethnicity Summary File 3 (sample data). Sample data (based on information collected only on longform questionnaires, such as education, occupation, and income) on population characteristics down to the block group level will be provided on Summary File 3 (SF-3). These data will be shown for the total population and for the same nine racial and ethnic groups for which data on 100-percent population characteristics will be shown on SF-1. The data on SF-3 will be shown subject to a population threshold (see earlier discussion of SF-2); however, this threshold has not yet been determined. SF-3 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Summary File 4 (sample data). Sample data on population characteristics down to the census tract level will be provided on Summary File 4 (SF-4). These data will be shown for the same list of racial and ethnic groups for which data on 100-percent population characteristics will be shown on SF-2. The data on SF-4 will be shown subject to a population threshold (see earlier discussion of SF-2); however, this threshold has not yet been determined. SF-4 will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. Quick Tables (sample data). The earlier description of Quick Tables in conjunction with 100percent data applies also to sample data. Quick Tables will be available down to the census tract level and will show extensive sample data by race and ethnicity, including population characteristics for racial and ethnic groups included in SF-3 and SF-4. The population threshold for sample Quick Tables will depend on the threshold selected for SF-3 and SF-4. Quick Tables will be available on the Internet. 6. Microdata Files Tabulations on population characteristics by race and ethnicity described above are limited to what is planned for aggregated data products. In addition, the Census Bureau will produce 41   public-use microdata sample (PUMS) files, as was done in 1990, which will include data by race and ethnicity. Plans for PUMs files from Census 2000, including the amount of racial and ethnic detail, are currently being developed. In 1990, in addition to the confidentiality edit described earlier, the PUMS files were stripped of names and addresses, the order of records was rearranged on the file, and a minimum population threshold of 100,000 was used. In addition, and subject to the Census Bureau's strict confidentiality standards, the Census Bureau plans to make available on the Internet through the American FactFinder, an Advanced Query Function that permits data users to create tabulations to their own specifications based on microdata files. These microdata files, which underlie the 100-percent and sample summary files, are the 100-percent edited detail file (HEDF) and the sample edited detail file (SEDF). If a data user wants data on population characteristics for a racial or ethnic group for which characteristics are not available in summary files or Quick Tables and for a geographic area for which a PUMS file is not available, it will be possible -- again, subject to strict confidentiality standards set by the Census Bureau -- to obtain these data with a custom tabulation from the Census Bureau. Because of the strict confidentiality standards, the quantity of data that can be obtained will depend on several factors, including the geographic area, the size of the population universe, and the extent of the characteristics' detail.  42   Table 3.1.

Survey and Administrative Records Data This section applies to the presentation of data collected under the 1997 standards through surveys and administrative records. Although these proposed tabulation guidelines are applicable in the near term, they are designed to provide a framework that can be expanded in the future as it becomes possible to present more data on multiple race responses. The main guideline is that data should be presented in as much detail as possible (thereby satisfying the congruence with respondent's choice criterion), subject to agency criteria for statistical reliability and confidentiality (satisfying the meet confidentiality and reliability standards criterion), and thus the amount of detail presented will be a function of sample size and sample design. In addition, to the extent possible, Federal agencies should report data using the same set of standardized categories to facilitate comparisons across subjectmatter areas and data systems, thus satisfying the criteria relating to range of applicability, statistical defensibility, and understandability and communicability. The decision to revise the policy for the collection of data on race reflects the increasing complexity of our Nation's demographics. As a result, the ways that survey and administrative record data on race are tabulated and analyzed also will become more complex. The proposed guidelines in this section reflect this complexity. Every attempt was made to keep the tables as simple as possible in order to satisfy the criteria ease of use and skill required. Examples of tabulation strategies are provided and illustrated using data collected as part of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to report more than one race, but has also asked respondents to indicate the single race with which they most closely identified. The data on race from this survey have been retabulated for illustrative purposes to be as comparable as possible to the categories in the 1997 standards. (The tables in this section are based on data combined from three years of NHIS data. The resulting larger sample size improves the reliability of the estimates and enables more categories to be shown; however, even when combining three years of data on race, counts for some categories cannot be shown due to small sample sizes. In addition, in some tables, cell counts are divided by a constant to illustrate the situation faced by surveys with smaller sample sizes than the NHIS and/or where it is not possible or appropriate to combine more than one year of data.) As noted above, agencies are to provide as much detail as possible while adhering to their own standards for data quality and confidentiality. Under a typical data quality standard, a table cell cannot be published if its relative standard error (or other measure of dispersion) is larger than some value specified by the agency. Such a cell would be suppressed (withheld from publication). Under a confidentiality standard, a cell value must be suppressed if knowledge of the cell value might enable someone to gain knowledge about one of the respondents contributing data to the cell. If a cell is suppressed to preserve confidentiality, other cells must also be suppressed so the cell value cannot be derived by subtraction. This is called ""complementary suppression."" In either situation, information on subgroups that cannot appear 48   separately in the table would be included in appropriate subtotals and/or in the total. (The reader may wish to refer to Statistical Policy Working Paper 22: Report on Statistical Disclosure Limitation Methodology for more information concerning the definition of sensitive cells and the selection of cells for complementary suppression. The Statistical Policy Working Papers are available on the Internet at www.fedstats.gov -- go to Policy.) Since agencies do not use a common set of standards for evaluating confidentiality and quality issues, arbitrary cell size criteria were adopted in this report to illustrate how the application of agency quality and confidentiality standards might affect the cells that can be shown in tables. No data for cells of less than 150 are shown in any table. The tables that result give a preview of the distributions that are likely to result from the implementation of the 1997 standards. Note that since the only data being displayed in this report are population counts, it is possible to show more data cells using the 150 criterion than would be the case if the table presented attributes (income, education, health outcomes, etc.) of these groups. In addition, counts are provided for all ages and both sexes. If data are presented for one sex or one age group, as is most often the case, cell sizes would be much smaller and not as many cells could be reported. Individual survey systems will make decisions as to what data can be shown based on the characteristics of each system and the confidentiality and reliability guidelines established for that data system. It will not be possible to tabulate two types of responses into the categories identified in the standards. The first type of response is when no information on race is provided. In this report the heading ""Race Not Reported"" is used for this type of response. This response type can be further subdivided according to the reason that no information was obtained -- refusal, don't know, and not ascertained. The second type is when the response that was received does not match any of the standard racial categories. Such responses are tabulated in this report using the heading ""Other Race."" Given that sample size will determine what categories can be shown in a given table, a third heading, ""Not Tabulated Above,"" will be used to include either single or ""more than one race"" categories that are specified in the standard, but that are not large enough to be published separately. Unknowns are included in this category as well. These three special headings (""Race Not Reported,"" ""Other Race,"" and ""Not Tabulated Above"") are used in the tables in this section for illustrative purposes. Since these categories are generally of more interest for methodological rather than substantive analyses, most statistical publications will probably use simpler ways of accounting for these types of responses. Strategies for tabulating these kinds of responses will follow agency policy and the analytic objectives of the report. A remaining issue to be addressed by Federal agencies is the manner in which data are edited and imputed. The rules used to edit and impute respondents' data on race and ethnicity will affect the racial distributions derived from Federal surveys and administrative records. As noted elsewhere in this report, rules for editing and imputation of data on race and ethnicity should be an area of further research and collaboration for Federal agencies, to ensure that the data reported are as comparable as possible. 49   Since the objective of this section is to illustrate different tabulation strategies, categories with frequencies too small to be shown will not be treated the same way in all of the tables. In some tables, the category is not shown at all in the table stub but the cell value is included in the total and might be included under the heading ""Not Tabulated Above"" (as described above). In other tables, the category is retained in order to clarify the structure of the table but data are replaced by a ""W"" to illustrate that they have been withheld from publication for data quality/confidentiality considerations. When the data are replaced by ""W,"" a footnote is used to describe the reason the data are not shown. No guidance is suggested for handling categories too small to be shown in the table. Such decisions will follow agency guidelines and the objectives of the analyses. In all tables in this section, the ""More Than One Race"" heading includes respondents who selected more than one of the five basic racial categories in the 1997 standards. Following recommendations in the standards, many data collection systems obtain information on a more detailed set of responses. When surveys collect more detailed information on race than the minimum five racial categories, some persons may indicate that they identify with more than one of the more detailed groups. For example, within the Asian group, respondents might indicate that they are of Chinese and Japanese heritage. These respondents would not be included in the ""More Than One Race"" heading, but would be included in the total for Asians. In tables where specific Asian heritages are reported, and if sample sizes are sufficient, an additional Asian subcategory could be used to indicate the number of individuals who marked more than one of the detailed Asian categories. Table 3.4 provides a detailed set of categories for tabulating data on race that reflects the major dimensions of the 1997 standards. Table 3.4 displays the five single categories, includes more detail on the Asian subgroups, and displays a number of multiple-response categories. The specific multiple response categories that could be presented in other data collection systems would be a function of the overall sample size and the regional characteristics of the population where the sample is selected. The detailed subcategories that are presented should support recreating the minimum basic set of racial categories (American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN); Asian; Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI); and White). To illustrate the construction of a table based on a survey with a smaller sample size, all cell counts have been divided by 20. Table 3.5 shows a category for each of the five single racial groups in the 1997 standards as well as a ""More Than One Race"" heading; sample sizes do not permit the presentation of more detailed categories, including single race AIAN and NHOPI and specific multiple race categories. Data are not shown separately for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, the single race category with the smallest frequency, nor for any of the subcategories under ""More Than One Race."" The category ""Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders"" is retained in the table stub and a ""W"" in the cell indicates that the value is withheld due to sample size. Since the Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander category is the only single race category that cannot be shown, both the number and the percent for the Native 50   Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander group are readily obtained by subtraction. This would be appropriate only if the cell were being suppressed for data quality concerns (i.e., the value is unreliable). If it were being suppressed for confidentiality concerns, another cell would also have to be suppressed to prevent the cell value from being obtained by subtraction. As was the case under the 1977 standards, it will often not be possible to tabulate data using all of the categories used to collect the information. If data for one or more of the five minimum racial categories fail the requirements for data quality or confidentiality, standard agency products should include them in an aggregation such as ""Not Tabulated Above,"" or only in the totals rather than combining them with categories that are publishable alone. For example, if the data for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders cannot be published separately, these data should not be combined with data in the Asian category (except when such combinations are needed for comparability with data collected under the 1977 standards). Instead, the data on Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders should be included in the total and either omitted from the detailed tabulations completely, replaced with a symbol and footnoted, or included in a separate heading for all groups not specifically tabulated (i.e., under the ""Not Tabulated Above"" heading.) This last approach is illustrated in Table 3.6 from Table 3.4 where cell counts have been divided by 60. This table is designed to illustrate what might happen when sample sizes are increasingly smaller and data from even fewer categories can be reliably presented. The American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, ""More Than One Race,"" and ""Race Not Reported"" categories are not listed separately in Table 3.6, but were included both in the Total and the ""Not Tabulated Above"" rows. In order to display as much data as possible, as well as to reflect the complexity of reporting on race, some additional categories may be tabulated and reported along with the basic tabulations. These categories may not be mutually exclusive but would combine categories to create useful analytic distinctions. For example, a heading could be created for persons reporting that they are Asian whether as a single race or in combination with any other race(s). Parallel categories could be created for any of the five single racial categories. The resulting counts are called ""all inclusive."" They form distributions for each individual racial group; that is, the sum of the percent of respondents who mark a particular group alone, the percent who mark that group and at least one other group, and the percent who did not mark that group is 100 percent. The all inclusive distributions may provide information on population groups that might not have sufficient size in the sample to be included in basic tabulations. Table 3.7 provides a suggested tabulation strategy. The ""NHOPI in combination with other races"" category does not meet the criteria for inclusion (n=150) and, therefore, is not shown. If this cell suppression were intended to preserve confidentiality, another cell would have to suppressed as well. This is illustrated by suppressing the ""NHOPI all inclusive"" category. Note that when the tabulation involves counts or percentages, the analyst can subtract the count or percentage for each single race from the all inclusive count or percentage to obtain the count of individuals reporting each race in combination with any other race(s). For example, the ""Black or African American all inclusive count"" minus the ""Black or African American"" single 51   race count will yield a count for those reporting ""Black or African American in combination with one or more other races."" This would not be possible if the tabulation included summary statistics (mean, median, or percent) for attributes such as income, education, or health outcomes. Tables 3.4 - 3.7 describe tabulation alternatives for data on race collected using the 1997 standards. These standards also affect the collection and reporting of data on Hispanic or Latino origin. The 1997 standards call for asking a question on Hispanic or Latino origin followed by a question on race but also allows under limited circumstances for a single, combined question where Hispanic or Latino origin is included in a list along with the five standard racial categories. In such a combined question, respondents are also instructed to ""mark one or more."" In either approach, Hispanic origin may be reported alone or in combination with one or more races. As was the case for the tabulation of data on race, data on Hispanic or Latino ethnicity can also be presented for specific subgroups (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican) as shown in Table 3.8. The tabulation headings used will be a function of the overall sample size and the population composition where the sample is selected. Table 3.8 presents data only on Hispanic ethnicity and does not include information on race. Whether separate questions or a combined format is used to collect data on Hispanic or Latino origin and race, there are applications where a combined tabulation of the data on these two dimensions is preferred. Data collected under the 1997 standards using either format will support the analysis of data on both Hispanics or Latinos and non-Hispanics or non-Latinos by race (Table 3.9). For example, Table 3.9 shows that among Hispanics or Latinos, the sample size permits the presentation of data for Blacks, Whites, those of ""other"" races, and those selecting more than one race. Tabulations which incorporate the Hispanic or Latino subgroup information can be developed by expanding Table 3.9. Since respondents are free to select one or more categories in the combined format, data collected from a survey or administrative reporting system where a combined format is used can also be tabulated using Tables 3.8 or 3.9.  52   Table 3.4.

A. Civil Rights Enforcement and Monitoring OMB Bulletin No. 00-02. In response to requests from agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws, OMB led an interagency group that developed guidance on:   the collection of aggregate data on race when agencies request information from businesses, schools, and other entities and the allocation by agencies of multiple race responses, whether individual or aggregate, for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement.  This guidance (issued as OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, dated March 9, 2000 -- see Appendix B) ensures that agencies can continue to monitor compliance with laws that offer protections for those who historically have experienced discrimination and that reporting burdens are minimized for those reporting aggregate data on race to Federal agencies. The 1997 standards require, among other things, that agencies offer individuals the opportunity to select one or more races when reporting information on race in Federal data collections. Federal enforcement agencies often collect data on race from businesses, schools, and other entities in aggregate form. To meet these reporting requirements, these institutions will now be collecting single and multiple race responses from individuals and aggregating them for Federal reports. To simplify and minimize the reporting burden for institutions, an aggregation method has been developed that uses:    the five single race categories; four double race combinations most frequently reported in recent studies; any multiple race combinations based on Census 2000 data that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest in the relevant jurisdictions; and  60     a balance category to report those individual responses that are not included in (1) one of the five single race categories or four double race combinations or (2) other combinations that represent more than one percent of the population in a jurisdiction.  This method provides consistency across agencies for the reporting of aggregate data, but does not preclude the collection of more detailed information if the agency chooses to do so. The following example illustrates this aggregation method. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American > 1 percent: Fill in if applicable______________________ > 1 percent: Fill in if applicable______________________ Balance of individuals reporting more than one race Total  To provide consistency across agencies responsible for enforcing civil rights laws, guidance has been developed for how multiple race responses should be allocated. This allocation guidance does not use methods that require either fractional or double counting of individuals, or arbitrary allocation of responses to one minority group versus another. The following rules will be used to allocate multiple race responses for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement.   Responses in the five single race categories are not allocated. Responses that combine one minority race and white are allocated to the minority race.  61     Responses that include two or more minority races are allocated as follows:   If the enforcement action is in response to a complaint, allocate to the race that the complainant alleges the discrimination was based on. If the enforcement action requires assessing disparate impact or discriminatory patterns, analyze the patterns based on alternative allocations to each of the minority groups.  Allocation for enforcement purposes should not be confused with various allocation methods for ""bridging"" to past data collections as discussed in Chapter 5 of this report. The principal purpose of allocation for bridging purposes is to conduct trend or time series analysis. 1. Redistricting One of the first official statutory uses of data on race and ethnicity collected under the new standards will be for legislative redistricting following Census 2000. The new data format should not require substantial changes in the way redistricting will be conducted. a. Background Before a new redistricting plan can legally be implemented, states and political subdivisions that are covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act (which include all state and local jurisdictions in nine states and parts of seven others) are required to demonstrate to either the United States Attorney General or a Federal district court in the District of Columbia that their new redistricting plan has neither the purpose nor the effect of reducing the voting strength of their minority citizens. In addition, all states and political subdivisions are prohibited by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act from using redistricting plans that have the purpose or effect of discriminating against minority voters, including diluting their voting strength. The U.S. Department of Justice or private citizens may file lawsuits to enforce Section 2. In order to comply with these Federal laws, states and their political subdivisions typically use the Bureau of Census redistricting count tabulations issued pursuant to Public Law 94-171 to assess the racial and ethnic compositions and distributions of their residents as they draw their redistricting plans. The data are also central to the Department's analysis of whether or not a new redistricting plan reduces the voting strength of minority citizens in violation of Section 5 of the Act. The data are also used for evaluating and proving claims under Section 2 of the Act. For example, the data are used to determine where minority voters are concentrated, as well as to identify areas of racially polarized voting. After the redistricting process is complete, courts rely on the redistricting count data, together with other evidence, to decide any Section 2 legal challenge that may be filed challenging the redistricting plan.  62   b. How the 2000 Census Data Will Be Used for Redistricting in 2001 The 1990 census Public Law 94-171 tabulations reported data down to the block level for the total population and the voting age population (ages 18 years and older) for four racial groups (American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and White) and a residual category (""other"" race). Data on these racial groups were also cross-tabulated by Hispanic origin. Categories were mutually exclusive (each person was counted only once), and the categories added to the total population reported for a geographic region. In Census 2000, there are three major changes to the reporting of data on race and ethnicity: (1) the instruction to ""mark one or more"" racial categories; (2) the splitting of the ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" category into two separate categories -- ""Asian"" and ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;"" and (3) the combining of the 1990 categories for American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut into a single ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" category with a write-in space (as in 1990) for principal or enrolled tribe. Hispanic or Latino origin was ascertained in a separate question, as in the 1990 census. The Census 2000 PL 94-171 Redistricting Data will, for the first time, include tabulations of persons who marked two or more races (the multiple race tabulations). In tabulating the PL 94-171 data, the Bureau of the Census will produce 63 tabulation categories: 6 tabulation categories for the 5 ""single race"" groups plus ""some other race""; and 57 tabulation categories for possible combinations of these 6 groups. Such data will be reported in full detail down to the block level to provide the flexibility needed for the enforcement of civil rights programs, and particularly for analysis of redistricting plans under the Voting Rights Act. In accordance with Title 13, U.S. Code, the Census Bureau will continue to protect the confidentiality of individuals during the tabulation and presentation of the Voting Rights data at every step in the process and during the course of Census 2000. The inclusion of multiple race tabulations in the PL 94-171 redistricting data file has raised questions as to how such data will be analyzed by the Department of Justice pursuant to its responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act. This issue has been addressed in OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, issued on March 9, 2000 (see Appendix B). In its analysis of the Census redistricting data, the Department of Justice will be guided by the bulletin. After aggregating the data pursuant to Part I of the bulletin, multiple race responses will be allocated pursuant to Part II of the bulletin. Thus, any responses that indicate white and one minority race will be allocated to the minority race. Multiple race responses that include more than one minority race will be reviewed to determine if there are any patterns affecting any of the minority races reported. Current research indicates that the number of multiple race responses in the Census 2000 is expected to be small  2 percent or less. Therefore, the impact of multiple race responses on the analysis of Census data for purposes of the Department of Justice's responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act is likely to be minimal. The computer record layout reflecting this new design can be accessed now at: http://www.census.gov/clo/www/plrecordnew.pdf. Copies are also available by contacting the Census Redistricting Data Office at 301-457-4039 or at RDO@Census.gov . 63   2. Equal Employment Opportunity This section describes the process for implementing the 1997 standards in data collections that are used for monitoring equal employment opportunities. One of the Federal Government's most significant uses of data on race and ethnicity is in its efforts to ensure that every individual has an equal opportunity for employment. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination in employment based upon race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or retaliation/reprisal. Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, similarly prohibits discrimination in employment by Federal Government contractors. Executive Order No. 11246 also requires contractors covered by its provisions to ensure affirmatively that they do not discriminate against their employees and applicants for employment. Responsibility for enforcement of Federal equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws and regulations is shared among the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the U.S. Department of Education. The Federal EEO agencies use data on race and ethnicity to ensure nondiscrimination in employment. In implementing the 1997 standards, the EEO agencies will consider the burden imposed on those required to collect and report racial and ethnic data to the Federal Government. The 1997 standards are not intended to diminish the availability and quality of information collected and made available for civil rights enforcement purposes. Following the 1990 census, the Census Bureau, under contract to EEO agencies, created an EEO Special File that has been generally used as a benchmark for employment availability determinations. It is anticipated that a similar file containing data collected under the 1997 standards will be created from the Census 2000 data. a. Employee and Applicant Reporting Requirements  Methods Used Prior to Implementing the 1997 Standards Data on each private employer's workforce are collected annually on the Employer Information Reports (EEO-1 Report). Biennial surveys are collected from local referral unions (EEO-3), state and local governments (EEO-4), elementary and secondary public schools (EEO-5), and post-secondary schools using the Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS Fall Staff Survey, formerly EEO-6). Currently, these forms collect information about each employer's workforce by job category, gender, and race/ethnicity using the categories in the 1977 standards.  64   Under the 1977 standards, employers were only required to collect, maintain, and report single race information on employees, using the following five categories: (1) White, not of Hispanic origin; (2) Black, not of Hispanic origin; (3) Hispanic; (4) Asian or Pacific Islander; and (5) American Indian or Alaskan Native. Instructions on the current EEO forms state that the race/ethnicity of an employer's workforce may be obtained either by ""visual surveys of the workforce, or from post-employment records."" The current instructions explicitly state that eliciting information from employees via direct inquiry is not encouraged. The OFCCP is developing an Equal Opportunity Survey (EO Survey) to obtain employment information from selected Federal contractor establishments. The EO Survey will collect information about applicant and employee personnel activity, and employee compensation, by gender, race, and ethnicity, sorted by EEO-1 job categories. The survey requests that each applicant or employee be identified by gender, by Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin, and by one of the five racial categories. Contractors responding to the EO Survey have discretion to use the 1977 racial/ethnic categories if they have not yet converted their record keeping to the 1997 standards. Educational institutions, however, should follow the guidelines set forth in Section 3 on Equal Access to Education for reporting data on their employees. For reporting covering 2000 through 2002, employers (including contractors) and unions subject to these reporting requirements will continue to submit EEO-1, EEO-3, EEO-4, EEO-5, OFCCP EO Survey, and IPEDS Fall Staff Survey, in their respective current formats. Employers will use the new forms that reflect the 1997 standards starting in 2003 to provide data on the work force for the 2003 calendar year. b. Required Changes to EEO Forms and Instructions to Implement the 1997 Standards To be consistent with the 1997 standards, certain changes are planned for EEO reporting forms and instructions. These changes (along with updates to reflect changes in the industry and occupational classifications) will be submitted as usual under the Paperwork Reduction Act for OMB approval, allowing sufficient time so that non-Federal employers may prepare for their use starting in 2003. Data collections covering Federal employment will also be updated by OPM and EEOC to reflect the 1997 standards. OPM is engaged in ongoing discussions with numerous Federal agencies to develop a standardized approach for collecting and reporting data under the 1997 standards. The following changes are planned for the reporting forms and instructions: -- The ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"" racial category will be added. -- ""Asian"" will replace the category ""Asian or Pacific Islander.""  65   -- The following changes in terminology will be made: -- ""Alaska Native"" will replace the term ""Alaskan Native."" -- ""Black or African American"" will replace the term ""Black."" -- ""Hispanic or Latino"" will replace the term ""Hispanic."" -- Data on Hispanic or Latino ethnicity will be collected in a separate question for each occupational group. c. EEO Approach to Data Collection and Record Keeping Requirements Under the 1997 Standards Federal EEO agencies use a variety of reporting forms to collect and other establishments. These forms are subject to review and Paperwork Reduction Act. In redesigning EEO forms to comply following categories for race will be recommended for EEO data data from businesses, schools, approval by OMB under the with the 1997 standards, the collection and record keeping:  American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American Balance of individuals reporting more than one race The balance category will be used to report individual responses that are not included in any of the single race categories or in any of the two-race categories listed above. When Census 2000 data become available, the EEO agencies will undertake an analysis of the distribution of two-race combinations. This analysis will be undertaken, first, to confirm the four most common multiple race combinations found at the national level. If they are different from the four previously mentioned, the EEO proposed forms will be changed accordingly. Second, this analysis will be used to determine whether there are any additional multiple race combinations that should reported in the EEO proposed forms. In addition, the following changes in EEO data collections are being made as part of the implementation of the 1997 standards:  Self-identification will be the preferred method of collecting data on race and ethnicity in the employment setting.  66      Individuals will be permitted to report one or more races on applications and other forms pertaining to their employment. A two-question format will be used to obtain information on the ethnicity and race of each applicant or employee. The ethnicity question (Hispanic or Latino or Not Hispanic or Latino) will be asked first, followed by the race question. If an applicant or employee declines to self-report, employers may then determine the information on race and ethnicity required for reporting purposes by visual observation or from post-employment records.    d. Ensuring Common Approaches in EEO Enforcement As set forth by OMB in Bulletin No. 00-02 (see Appendix B), the following principles apply regarding data on race in enforcing employment discrimination laws and regulations:    Individuals who select only one racial category will be counted in that category. Individuals who select one minority race and White will be counted as part of that minority race. For the purpose of analyzing an enforcement action, responses of individuals who select more than one minority race will be allocated to the race involved in the enforcement action, if that race is among the ones they have selected. For example, where an enforcement action is based on complaints of discrimination on the basis of Black or African American, responses from individuals reporting themselves as Black or African American and American Indian or Alaska Native will be allocated into the Black or African American category for the purpose of analyzing the enforcement action. For nonenforcement-related analyses covering internal and external workforce distributions, several implementation issues remain unresolved at this time. For example, questions covering increased employer record keeping burdens under alternative allocation approaches must be examined further. Additionally, where the enforcement involves Federal litigation, questions remain to be resolved regarding judicial interpretation of both analytical methodology and admissible evidence standards that cover private and Federal lawsuits.    e. Resurveying the Workforce In converting to a new EEO-1 form in 2003 that reflects 1997 standards, employers will have to reconcile the 1997 standards with the pre-1997 standards under which employee race and ethnicity will be reported through 2002. In issuing the 1997 standards, OMB did not indicate  67   that employers, in implementing the new standards, would be required to resurvey incumbent employees whose race/ethnicity was originally classified under the pre-1997 standards. Each EEO agency will determine if resurveying should be required as part of its enforcement activity. Employers who report to more than one Federal agency, one of which requires resurveying, will be required to resurvey irrespective of whether the other Federal agencies impose the same requirement. After a careful review of the pros and cons associated with resurveying, EEOC may require resurveying as part of its record keeping and reporting requirement. EEOC seeks to ensure that the race and ethnicity reported by employees hired under the old standards prior to 2003, and by employees hired under the 1997 standard beginning with reports filed in 2003, will be consistent and comparable. EEOC is concerned that, unless resurveying is conducted, the racial identity of employees previously reported as Hispanic would be unknown. Complete racial and ethnic comparisons are needed to ensure data continuity and comparability, and to promote accuracy in enforcing EEO laws and regulations. 3. Equal Access to Education Another significant use of race and ethnicity data occurs in the context of the Federal Government's efforts to ensure that every individual has an equal opportunity for education and to collect and analyze data on the educational experience in America. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division are responsible for enforcement of the statutes that protect equal opportunity in education regardless of race, color, sex, national origin, age, or disability pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. OCR also monitors whether a recipient of Federal financial assistance has utilized criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The Department of Justice also enforces Title IV and Title VI, as well as the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, and also may intervene in private suits that allege violations of education related anti-discrimination statutes and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the National Center for Education Statistics is authorized to collect, analyze, and disseminate statistics on race and other population characteristics when such information would facilitate educational policy and decision making. a. Data Collection and Record Keeping Requirements Under the 1997 Standards On March 9, 2000, OMB issued Bulletin No. 00-02 (see Appendix B) providing guidance for Federal enforcement agencies in their use of data on race for civil rights monitoring and enforcement. The guidance indicates that for this purpose Federal agencies should aggregate data into the five single race categories, the four most frequently reported multiple race combinations, and any multiple race combinations that comprise more than one percent of the population of interest.  68   b. Racial and Ethnic Data in Educational Institutions Data on the race and ethnicity of students are critical to many sound educational practices and to monitoring and enforcing civil rights in educational institutions. The elimination of discrimination in educational institutions ensures that all individuals have equal access to educational opportunities. Although Federal enforcement agencies do not determine civil rights compliance based on numbers alone, analyzing student populations by race and other important factors can identify potential issues or problems. This information also enables schools to take proactive steps to prevent potential civil rights violations. Furthermore, assessing the performance of districts, schools, and students by examining information on race and ethnicity can serve important educational goals. Such assessments can allow schools to identify where new approaches or programs are needed and whether existing programs are serving the needs of all students. The Department of Education has received information from individual schools and states as well as anecdotal reports in the media that suggest that asking children to self-report their race may lead to higher multiple race reports when compared to adult self-reports. Some information indicates that this rate could be substantially higher, particularly in certain jurisdictions. For example, one state has informed Federal officials that 16 percent of its school age population would identify itself as more than one race (in contrast to the estimated 2 percent of the overall nationwide population). In this state, there is also evidence which suggests that some of these students are inconsistent in identifying their race and ethnicity; that is, they change their answers to race and ethnicity questions depending on the situation and/or over time. Moreover, there is research evidence that as children with multiple racial heritages age, they tend to identify with one race in somewhat larger numbers than when they were younger. Federal enforcement agencies must balance the interest in obtaining complete, detailed data to facilitate effective monitoring of the civil rights laws with the need to minimize the cost and burden on schools and colleges of collecting and reporting information. The collection and reporting of all possible combinations of race and ethnic categories would create an excessive burden for many, if not most, institutions. Further, such an excessive burden could dramatically slow the receipt of information on educational institutions and thereby delay the enforcement process. The Federal Government recognizes these potential burdens. Bulletin No. 00-02 states that ""we must minimize reporting burden for institutions such as schools and businesses that report aggregate data on race to Federal agencies."" The Bulletin also notes, however, that ""[a]s the revised standards for collecting and presenting data are implemented, we must ensure that we maintain our ability to monitor compliance with laws that offer protections for those who historically have experienced discrimination."" The Department of Education recognizes that educational institutions need to maintain consistency between changes affecting data on students and changes affecting data on staff and faculty. The Department of Education has elected to wait until after Census 2000 data are available to determine how educational institutions should aggregate racial and ethnic data for 69   their students and employees under the 1997 standards. Based on these data, the Department of Education will determine which race combinations (in addition to the five single race and four largest multiple race combinations) meet the one percent threshold for the relevant jurisdictions. The Department then will provide guidance to educational institutions on how racial and ethnic data should be aggregated and reported. c. Collection of Data on Race and Hispanic Ethnicity In addition to collecting data on race, the Department of Education and educational institutions at various state and local levels also collect information on Hispanic ethnicity. The tabulation of information on Hispanic ethnicity and race in light of the 1997 standards raises some challenging questions. As with the collection and aggregation of detailed data on race, the Department of Education recognizes the importance of obtaining more complete Hispanic origin information to facilitate effective civil rights monitoring and enforcement. However, the burden on educational institutions must be considered and balanced. There are three potential options for a unified tabulation approach for data on race and ethnicity. Some suggest that Hispanic or Latino data do not need to be tabulated by race. This suggestion is supported by an effort to minimize the burden on data collectors as well as evidence that many who identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino do not select a race (estimates range up to 30 percent). Others have suggested that the collection of data on race for those of Hispanic or Latino origin that mirror the non-Hispanic categories would create a symmetry that facilitates understanding and implementation. Alternatively, the collection of Hispanic or Latino data by some but not all racial categories could balance the need for the racial identification of Hispanics for civil rights enforcement with the burden on data collectors. Once the Department of Education reviews the results of Census 2000, the Department will reach a final decision on what data will be collected on the racial identification of Hispanic/Latino individuals. In general, educational agencies that collect data need three years from these final decisions to reconfigure their systems for the collection of racial and ethnic data under the 1997 categories. In the interim, educational institutions may collect information in greater detail than is presently required as long as any additional categories can be aggregated back into the minimum set of categories. 4. Enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 All agencies that enforce regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, are obligated to follow the guidance provided in this document and OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, which addresses aggregating and allocating data on race for civil rights enforcement and monitoring. The Title VI Coordination Regulations at 28 C.F.R.  42.406, provide that all agencies ""shall in regard to each assisted program provide for the collection of data and information from applicants for and recipients of Federal assistance sufficient to permit effective enforcement of [T]itle IV."" All agency Title VI regulations provide for the collection of such 70   data. Agencies currently follow the categories set forth in the Title VI Coordination Regulations, which ""are in conformity with the OMB Ad Hoc Committee on Race/Ethnic Categories' recommendations."" See 28 C.F.R.  42.302(e). The section states, however, that to the extent that these designations are modified by OMB, the regulation is to be interpreted to be consistent with any such OMB modifications. See 28 C.F.R.  42.402(e)(5). Accordingly, the categories listed in the regulation are no longer in effect. The 1997 revised standards, effective October 30, 1997, require all Federal agencies with Title VI compliance and enforcement obligations to provide for the collection of data by offering respondents the option of selecting one or more of the following racial categories: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander White  Pursuant to OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, agencies are instructed to tabulate data on race using the five single race categories outlined above plus the following four multiple race combinations most likely to occur: 1. 2. 3. 4. American Indian or Alaska Native and White Asian and White Black or African American and White American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American  Agencies are also advised to tabulate additional multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population at issue and include these combinations as part of any tabulation. Thus, all agency tabulations for data on race should reflect a minimum of ten categories: the five single race categories, the four multiple race categories, and a balance category. In surveys where there are additional multiple race combinations that are greater than one percent of the population at issue, those categories should be included in any final tabulation. All agencies with Title VI enforcement responsibilities should also be aware that OMB Bulletin No. 00-02 provides guidance for the allocation of multiple race responses for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement. Pursuant to that guidance, the following rules apply:    Responses in the five single race categories will not be allocated. Responses that combine one minority race and white are allocated to the minority race. Responses that include two or more minority races are allocated as follows: 71      If the enforcement action is in response to a complaint, a multiple race response will be allocated to the race that the complainant alleges the discrimination was based on. If the enforcement action requires assessing disparate impact or discriminatory patterns, analyze the patterns based on alternative allocations to each of the minority groups.  Under the 1997 standards, ""Hispanic or Latino"" is an ethnic category, not a racial category. Where agencies collect data on race and ethnicity separately, ethnicity must be collected first. In such cases, provisions shall be made to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are ""Hispanic or Latino"" and who are ""Not Hispanic or Latino."" All agencies must modify all new and revised record keeping or reporting forms that include racial and/or ethnic information to conform to the 1997 standards. All existing record keeping or reporting requirements must be consistent with these standards at the time they are submitted for extension, but not later than January 1, 2003. Agencies should note that OMB is the final arbiter of all modifications to racial and ethnic categories used in Federal data collection instruments. Executive Order No. 12250 gives the Attorney General authority to ensure the consistent and effective enforcement of Title VI and other nondiscrimination statutes that apply to recipients of Federal financial assistance. That authority has been delegated to the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. The Division, through the Coordination and Review Section, will ensure that all agencies are aware of the 1997 standards and are taking appropriate steps to implement the OMB guidance. The Division's Coordination and Review Section will be available to Federal agencies to assist them in this endeavor. B. Intercensal Estimates and Vital Records Following some background discussion, this section presents a description of the Census Bureau's Intercensal Population Estimates Program, its data sources, methodology, and major uses, and then discusses some of the important issues that must be addressed in implementing the 1997 standards in this program. Background. In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting. Because the intercensal population estimates are limited in their detail by the availability of administrative data, it was 1993 before the program could implement fully the 1977 standards by providing data for the population in the four racial categories of that standard -- White; Black; Asian or Pacific Islander; and American Indian or Alaskan Native. To comply with the 1977 standards, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program developed estimates by race separately for the population by Hispanic origin (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic).  72   The 1997 standards present many challenges, with two in particular posing the greatest challenges. One is that respondents to Federal data collections, including Census 2000, surveys, and vital statistics registrations, will be allowed to select one or more races. The other is that the Asian or Pacific Islander category has been split into two categories -- one called ""Asian"" and the other called ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander."" The population estimates are data driven. Changes to the program to produce estimates for new racial categories will depend upon the availability of data from a variety of sources. Although changes are possible, discussions with data providers and data users, as well as research and analysis of data collected using the 1997 standards, will be required before the Census Bureau can identify the racial categories that can be used in the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Because the intercensal population estimates serve several diverse purposes, exploring the possible outcomes of the estimates process and examining the implications of the 1997 standards are important. The issues raised by the 1997 standards are complicated and diverse. It will take considerable research and experimentation before the Intercensal Population Estimates Program can produce population estimates that fully follow the 1997 standards. The next sections describe the program and discuss the major issues that must be addressed in changing program outputs. 1. Description of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program The Intercensal Population Estimates Program, under Title 13, develops and releases annual estimates of the total population and its demographic characteristics. For the Nation, states, and counties, these characteristics include annual estimates by: age (single years of age (age 0 to age 99) and 100+); sex (male/female); race (White; Black; Asian and Pacific Islander; and American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut); and Hispanic origin (Hispanic/Non-Hispanic). The Intercensal Population Estimates Program currently provides estimates of the total population of functioning governmental units (cities, incorporated places, and minor civil divisions). The Census Bureau is considering expansion of the program to include smaller and more diverse units of geography (such as school districts), as well as the development of demographic characteristics for functioning governmental units and other smaller geographic units. 2. Uses of Population Estimates The population estimates are used in the intercensal period for funding allocations, as controls for Census Bureau and other Federal surveys, as denominators for vital statistics and other demographic events, and as planning tools for government and private programs and policy decisions. 73   Funding Allocations. Federal programs totaling $180 billion use these annual population estimates to make program decisions and to distribute these funds. Survey Controls. The population estimates are used as control totals for the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the new American Community Survey (ACS), other Federal surveys, and many private sector surveys. Most Federal surveys use national level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. The ACS currently uses county level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. Denominators for Demographic Events. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) currently uses the national, state, and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators to create birth and death rates and to calculate life tables by race and sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) frequently relies upon the estimates of population at various geographic levels as denominators for various health related and disease incidence rates. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) uses the county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators for the various cancer incidence rates released to the public. Planning Tools. The intercensal population estimates are frequently used as planning tools and as barometers to measure an area's growth and change since the last decennial census. In making policy decisions, local planners frequently cite the overall population level and the demographic characteristics products of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. 3. Methodology for Developing Intercensal Population Estimates The Intercensal Population Estimates Program develops its population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin using the demographically recognized cohort-component technique. In this technique, each component of population change -- births, deaths, international migration, and internal migration -- is estimated separately by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Various administrative records provide information needed to develop these components of population change. The estimates process begins with the most recent decennial census results and combines the estimated components of population change to develop the intercensal population estimates. The 1990 Census Base Population. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net undercoverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made in the distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. (See Comparability Issues below for a discussion of the modification of the 1990 decennial census.)  74   Birth and Death Components. In brief, NCHS provides annual counts and distributions of births and deaths by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin by county to the Census Bureau in a specially developed individual record file of the birth and death events. These individual records contain the detailed race and Hispanic classifications available from the birth and death certificates collected by NCHS. International Migration Component. The international net migration components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. The Census Bureau estimates the distribution by race and Hispanic origin from the country-of-birth tallies, using data from the 1990 Census on the foreign-born population who entered the United States from 1985 to 1990. The other components of international migration such as emigration and undocumented migration are developed using a combination of basic demographic modeling techniques. By examining data from other administrative records in combination with an analysis of the decennial census, the Census Bureau models the level and demographic characteristics of these other international migration components. Internal Migration Component. Data on internal migration are developed using a basic administrative records method. This method relies on annual extracts of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In this approach, using the Social Security Number (SSN) on the return, the Census Bureau can match the tax returns for two years and obtain state of residence for the two periods. By comparing the state of residence at the two points in time, annual measures of migration can be developed for states. Until recently, the Census Bureau had only developed the national population estimates by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population for states and counties. During the current decade, the Census Bureau started to develop a set of state and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. The state population estimates are developed using the basic cohort component technique outlined above. Since the standard tax return provides no demographic characteristics of the tax filer, the Census Bureau must further modify the basic administrative records method to estimate internal migration by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To obtain demographic characteristics, the Bureau has relied on the annual extract of tax returns provided by the IRS, and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration (SSA) Application File (NUMIDENT). This NUMIDENT file includes SSN, month and year of birth, race, sex, and six characters of the last name for each SSN holder in the sample file. The extract of the NUMIDENT file has been merged with the tax returns file by SSN to derive demographic characteristics of IRS filers. Because the Census Bureau was able to receive only a 75   20 percent sample of this basic NUMIDENT file, the Bureau appended the demographic characteristics of the primary filer to only the same 20 percent sample of tax returns. Besides demographic characteristics of the primary filers, the model requires demographic characteristics of those persons claimed as exemptions on the tax return. The rules for assigning demographic characteristics to dependents are straightforward and rely on basic familial and demographic relationships. Because the NUMIDENT File was restricted to a 20 percent sample until this year, the Census Bureau could not use the merged tax file and SSA data to develop county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To develop the current sets of county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, a ratio approach is employed. This approach combines the full set of age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin detail for the county in 1990 with the newly developed state population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population of the county. With the delivery of the 100 percent NUMIDENT file to the Census Bureau, work on employing the cohort component technique to develop the county estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin is anticipated. 4. Data Availability The intercensal population estimates are ""data driven."" As noted above, the decennial census, the National Center for Health Statistics, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Social Security Administration are all important sources for developing intercensal population estimates. Using the current methodology, estimates cannot be produced without the availability of these data. Decennial Census Data. Census 2000 is the first time that decennial population data are available using the 1997 standards for collecting racial data. Birth and Death Data. The National Vital Statistics System is the basis for the Nation's official statistics on births and deaths (including infant deaths). The data are provided through vital registration systems maintained and operated by the individual states and territories where the original certificates are filed. While the legal authority for vital registration rests with the states and territories, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is required to produce national vital statistics by collecting data from the vital records of all the states. The NCHS cooperates with the states in developing the standard forms for data collection as well as standard procedures for data preparation and processing in order to promote a uniform national data base. The degree of uniformity necessary for national statistics has been achieved by periodic issuance of recommended standards by the responsible national agency (NCHS) and the cooperative adoption of these standards by the individual registration areas. These standards include the U.S. Standard Certificates of Live Birth. The standard certificates have been the principal means for achieving the uniformity in information on which national statistics are based; the standard certificate of live birth has been revised 11 times since 1900.  76   The standard certificates represent the minimum basic data set necessary for the collection and publication of comparable national, state, and local vital statistics data. Also participating in this effort to produce quality, consistent data is the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), the association of State registrars. Because the State certificates have multiple uses, many factors must be considered and evaluated in deciding what should be included in the recommended standards. Faced with the many uses -- legal, administrative, public health, statistical -- of vital records, NCHS and the state vital statistics offices must make choices regarding the inclusion or exclusion of data items for each revision of the certificate. The NCHS shares in the costs incurred by the states through contractual agreements with each state. Under this arrangement, NCHS obtains and publishes vital statistics based on all births and deaths (e.g., 3,891,494 and 2,314,690, respectively, in 1996) occurring in the United States. Implementation of the 1997 standards on vital records will require changes in data collection and processing systems at all levels of government and very likely will take at least several years to accomplish throughout the United States. In addition to revising computer systems at the state and Federal levels, the electronic software that is used in hospitals to record and report over 90 percent of all births in the United States needs to be converted. Most importantly, the procedures used to collect birth and death data in hospitals and funeral homes will need to be revised and the appropriate staff will need to be trained. During 1998 and 1999, NCHS sponsored a committee of state vital statistics officials and representatives of the relevant professions in a series of meetings to evaluate the entire content and format of the current Standard Certificates. It can be anticipated that not all registration areas will implement the 1997 standards at the same time or with complete coverage and compliance at the start. Only one state has implemented the revised race question on birth and death certificates in the year 2000. Most others will wait until the next revisions of the U.S. Standard Certificates of Birth and Death are implemented in 2003. International Migration Components. As discussed above, the international migration components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. To develop data on the race and Hispanic origin of the entering immigrants, the Census Bureau combines the information on country of birth from the INS files with information from the most recent decennial census. Because the INS and other data sources on international migration do not code race or Hispanic origin, no change in these sources is anticipated. The Census Bureau will need to examine the results of Census 2000 and develop new algorithms to accommodate the 1997 categories for data on race. 77   Internal Migration Components. To develop the internal migration component, the Census Bureau currently relies upon the annual extract of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration (SSA) Application File (NUMIDENT). Under an agreement between the Census Bureau and SSA, the Census Bureau has recently gained access to a full 100 percent NUMIDENT file. This opens additional opportunities for developing population estimates below the national level by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. This component also presents the biggest obstacle to modifying categories for data on race in the intercensal population estimates process. Under the Social Security system, data on race are provided as part of the Social Security card application process. For the oldest among the population currently covered in the NUMIDENT files, the last application date could refer to the beginning of the Social Security system. Until 1980, the SSA application system provided three racial categories -- White, Black, and Other. Beginning in 1980, the SSA modified the racial categories on the SSA application form to include five categories -- (1) Asian, Asian-American or Pacific Islander; (2) Hispanic; (3) Black (non-Hispanic); (4) North American Indian or Alaskan Native; (5) White (non-Hispanic). Although SSA modified the racial categories application card, people who already had an SSA card did not have to resubmit their data on race. Thus, pre-1980 entries on the SSA file have information for three racial categories (White, Black, and Other), while entries after 1980 have information for five racial categories. The application for a Social Security card needs to be updated to reflect the 1997 standards. Another change to the Social Security application procedure has presented challenges to the use of data on race. Beginning in the late 1980's, the SSA introduced the ""enumeration at birth program."" Under this program, parents could request a social security number for their newborn children with the birth registration process. Because the birth certificates do not include racial information for the newborn, it is impossible to code race for the newborn onto the SSA file. While information on race is available for the birth mother and father on the basic birth registration certificate, these data are not made available to SSA and are not on the basic NUMIDENT file received by the Census Bureau. 5. Comparability Issues Even the availability of the required source data does not ensure the capability to produce reasonable and accurate population estimates. Production of population estimates by the major demographic characteristics depends upon the availability of comparable data across the various data sources. While comparability issues with respect to race reporting are not new, the increased complexities of new racial categories are likely to exacerbate the problems. 78   The issues about comparability in race reporting are present in the current set of intercensal population estimates. Data from the 1990 census on race posed several of these problems. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net under coverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made to that distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. For age, the aim was to correct biases in census age tabulations that resulted from displacement of age reporting from the reference date of the census. In 1990 census publications, age is based on respondents' direct reports of age at last birthday, with some editing for age misstatement. This definition proved inadequate for postcensal estimates; many respondents reported their age (even if correctly) at the time of completion of the census form or interview by an enumerator, either of which could have occurred several months after the April 1 reference date. As a result, age was slightly biased upward. Modification was based on a respecification of age, for most individual respondents, according to their year of birth. Age was derived from year of birth by allocating date of birth to the first quarter and last three quarters of each year, subtracting year of birth from 1990 for those born before April 1, and from 1989 for those born after April 1. The allocation was based on an historical series of registered births by month. For race, the objective of the modification was to conform to the definition of race specified in the 1977 standards. In the 1990 census, a substantial number of people (roughly 9.8 million) did not specify a racial group that could be classified in any of the categories on the census form: White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander. A large majority of these people were of Hispanic origin (based on their response to a separate, Hispanic origin question on the form), and many wrote in their Hispanic origin, or Hispanic origin type (for example, Mexican or Puerto Rican) as their race. People of unspecified race were allocated to one of the four tabulated racial groups (White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo or Aleut; and Asian or Pacific Islander) based on their response to the Hispanic origin question. These four categories for race conform with the 1977 standards, and are more consistent with the categories in other administrative sources than are the original census tabulations. When combining across data sets and agencies, the problems of comparability in reporting of race become more severe. Clearly, the added complexity of reporting more than one race will add to this problem, particularly as different reporting situations (such as the census or the birth and death certificates) engender differential tendencies to report more than one race. Differences in allocation and editing procedures will almost certainly exacerbate the problem as exemplified by the problem of using data from different data universes in the calculation of rates.  79   Comparability of race data from the Census 2000 and from vital statistics will be more problematic until the Vital Statistics System adopts the new data collection standards in 2003. NCHS, Census Bureau, and OMB jointly sponsored a workshop in July 2000 which was conducted by the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department of The George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services and the Metropolitan Washington Public Health Assessment Center. The aim of the workshop was to develop a research agenda designed to address these problems. Workshop participants identified several research strategies that could be used to address the technical and methodological issues that the 1997 standards for data on race and ethnicity raise for vital statistics and population estimates, and to address some of the more conceptual and perceptual aspects of race and ethnicity that influence reporting in censuses, surveys, and vital records. A summary of the workshop is being prepared. Selected research strategies are summarized below: Census or Survey-based Matching Studies: In such studies, the race and ethnicity reported on birth or death certificates could be compared with the race and ethnicity reported for those individuals in the decennial census or surveys such as the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey. The participants also recommended the continuation of the National Longitudinal Mortality Studies. Studies of Selected Vital Records: Although NCHS works with the states to establish a standard set of data on births and deaths to be reported to the Federal Government, the original data collection process is established and managed by each individual state. As a result, some states are collecting additional data on race and ethnicity that could be used to study features of race and ethnicity reporting in vital records and to explore how reporting may change under the 1997 standards. NCHS is investigating the possibility of obtaining additional race information for a selected number of states for methodological purposes. Studies to Identify Sources of Error: A careful study of the potential sources of error -both bias and random variation -- in the data and procedures used to produce population estimates would provide valuable guidance to both the producers and users of those estimates. Some of the sources of error include the census undercount and undercount adjustments, missing data and imputation procedures, and misreporting and misclassification of data. The 1997 standards will not change the types of error in the data but will introduce specific new forms of error, such as misreporting or misclassification between single- and multiple-race categories, that need to be  80   understood. The proposed matching studies would help identify and quantify some types of bias in the data. Techniques like multiple imputation can be used to assess variance. Studies of the accuracy of estimates and projections: The Census Bureau produces population estimates and projections for states and communities, but states also produce independent estimates of their populations, which may differ from Census Bureau estimates. Studies are needed to compare the accuracy of Census Bureau and state estimates and to identify the sources of discrepancy. Studies on Race and Ethnicity: Proposals for other studies emphasized opportunities to improve data on race and ethnicity by gaining a better understanding of the meaning of racial and ethnic identities in society and of the factors that influence both selfidentification and identification of others. One suggestion was to look at how race and ethnicity were reported in Census 2000 for those in multiple race households. Studies might also use routinely conducted surveys like the Current Population Survey or the National Health Interview Survey to ask about the race of respondents' parents and other ancestors to learn more about the older roots of multiple race identities. An additional source of noncomparability results from the fact that the standard certificate of live birth includes items asking for the race of the mother and the race of the father. At no time have the certificates included a question on the race of the child. In 1988 and prior years, NCHS assigned a race to the child solely for statistical purposes. Births were tabulated by this assigned race of the child, which was created from information reported for the race(s) of the parents as entered on the birth certificate. When the parents were of the same race, as was the case for 95 percent of births with race reported for both mother and father in 1998, the child was assumed to be of the same race. If the parents were of different races and one parent was white, the child was assigned the race of the parent who was not white. When the parents were of different races, and neither parent was white, the child was assigned, for statistical purposes, to the father's race, with one exception: if either parent was Hawaiian, the child was assigned to Hawaiian. If race was missing for one parent, the child was assigned the race of the parent for whom race was reported. In 1989, NCHS changed its tabulation procedures and began tabulating births by the race of the mother. The most important factor influencing this decision was the 1989 revision of the birth certificate. This revision includes many more health questions that are directly associated with the mother (e.g., method of delivery, medical risk factors, tobacco and alcohol use, and maternal weight gain). Many of the other items that have been on the birth certificate since 1969 or even earlier also relate directly to the mother; for example, age, educational level, and receipt of prenatal care. In all these instances it is more appropriate to tabulate births by the mother's race.  81   A second factor influencing the decision to tabulate births by race of mother is the large proportion of births with race of father not reported, 14 percent in 1998. Although this proportion has declined slightly in the 1990's, it is still higher than in 1978, 11 percent. The high proportion of records with the father's race not reported reflects the increase in the proportion of births to unmarried women; in many such cases, no information is reported on the father. These births are already assigned the race of the mother because there is no alternative. Tabulating all births by race of mother, therefore, provides for a more uniform approach, rather than a necessarily arbitrary combination of parental races. It is important to keep in mind that the public use data files that NCHS produces and disseminates include both the mother's and father's races as reported on the birth certificate. Researchers and others may tabulate the birth data by race of the mother, by race of the father, or by race of the child as determined by the algorithm previously used by NCHS, or an alternative as they wish. For purposes of research based on data from the birth certificate itself, it is generally most appropriate to tabulate the birth data by the race of the mother. NCHS has re-tabulated all of the trend data on births by race of mother for the years beginning with the 1980 data year. To facilitate continuity and analysis of the data, trend tables showing data for years prior to 1980 show data for both race of mother and race of child. This makes it possible to distinguish the effects of this change from real changes in the data. There continues to be interest in collecting and reporting birth data according to the ""race of the child"" and this would be particularly relevant for developing population estimates. Over the last several years, this concept has been discussed by the panel charged with developing the forthcoming revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. The panel revising the certificate did not recommend that an item on the child's race be added to the birth certificate. As mentioned earlier, each state has its own certificate of live birth, and in most cases state certificates closely follow the content and format of the U.S. Standard Certificate. Individual states may choose to add an item asking for the ""race of the child,"" even though the item is not on the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. NCHS and colleagues in state vital statistics offices continue to research this issue. 6. Future Direction The process of developing a set of intercensal population estimates consistent with the 1997 standards will not be an easy one. Until data are available, making any commitments about the probable set of products is impossible. The Census Bureau realizes, however, that many data users need to know its plans in order to make their own program decisions. To begin this process, the Census Bureau is forming a technical interagency group of key data providers and key data users to address many of the major issues. Members of this group will 82   provide input on: (1) the feasibility of using one consistent set of categories on race across all geographic levels; (2) the feasibility of using population size as the only criterion for determining which categories by race will have separate population estimates; (3) the minimum cell size below which population estimates will not be produced; (4) the continued development of population estimates by mutually exclusive categories on race; and (5) the use of consistent methodologies for the different categories by race in the population estimates program. This technical group will also examine issues related to data allocation and editing -- important factors related to the data consistency issues. Detailed data on race from Census 2000 will not be available until mid 2001. In the meantime, the interagency group can address and reach consensus on most of the issues outlined above. Through these discussions with the data providers and data users, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program can begin to form some tentative plans. Although it is too soon to speculate on any outcomes, it is likely that the Intercensal Population Estimates Program will need to be flexible. During the coming decade, as more data become available using the 1997 standards, it is likely that the Census Bureau will continue the expansion of the population estimates program to include additional categories by race. C. Uniform Crime Reporting Program The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program was established by the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 1929. The UCR Program has as its primary mission the collection of uniform national crime statistics for the express purpose of assisting law enforcement across the Nation in strategic planning in the war against crime. Currently, nearly 17,000 city, county, and state law enforcement agencies voluntarily participate in the program. Even though it is often assumed that UCR statistics consist of a monolithic statistical collection effort, the UCR Program in reality comprises several programs, all with different data collection requirements. Approximately 89 percent of the crime reported to the FBI is through the Summary Reporting System. The Summary System reflects aggregate tallies of crime information from law enforcement agencies, and the collection of data on race is limited to arrest information only. UCR data are additionally collected through the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted Program, the Hate Crime Data Collection Program, and the National Incident-Based Reporting System  all of which provide for the collection of data on race. Race is usually determined by observation on the part of the responding officer or the victim of the crime, rather than self-identification. Any effort to collect information on race by self-identification is either difficult or impossible due to the reliance on third-party information or the sensitive nature of handling the response to a criminal incident.  83   The information collected in the UCR Program is a complex derivative of law enforcement operational databases. As such, the primary application of any UCR statistics, including those involving race, is by law enforcement in the examination of crime trends. The data provide law enforcement a unique means by which to conduct analyses, ranging from limited agency-specific to broadly multijurisdictional, in order to plan strategically for the maximum use of limited law enforcement resources. In concurrence with other national criminal justice operational databases managed by the FBI (e.g., National Crime Information Center and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, etc.), the UCR Program currently uses the four race categories specified by the 1977 standards. Incorporation of the 1997 standards into the UCR Program is being considered within the context of the burden such implementation would place upon law enforcement agencies in their participation in a voluntary program, and the feasibility of collecting the information in accordance with the 1997 standards within the confines of the normal law enforcement operational setting.  84   CHAPTER 5 COMPARING DATA COLLECTED UNDER THE 1997 AND THE 1977 STANDARDS This chapter is a summary of the Bridge Report: Tabulation Options for Trend Analysis, which is provided in Appendix C. A. Introduction Agencies whose data are used to display time trends in economic, social, and health characteristics by racial and ethnic groups may need to consider bridging methods to assist users in understanding the data collected under the 1997 standards. For some period of time, referred to as the bridge period, agencies may use two estimates. The first, a tabulation of the data collected under the 1997 standards (see Chapter 3, Part B), and the second, a ""bridging estimate"" or prediction of how the responses would have been collected and coded under the 1977 standards. The bridging estimate is designed only for analyzing historical trends in data series. Once the bridge period is over, the bridge estimates will no longer be needed. It should not be assumed that bridging is useful or required in every situation. Agencies should carefully consider whether they need bridging estimates. Bridging estimates may not be needed if agencies can tolerate a ""break"" in their data series or if comparison to another data series provides users with enough information about the change. If bridging estimates are not used, however, agencies should footnote the first occurrence of data collected under the 1997 standards. There are at least two purposes of bridge estimates: (1) to help users understand the relationship between the old and new data series (as noted above); and (2) to provide consistent numerators and denominators for the transition period, before all data are available in the new format. If there is a need for bridging, agencies should carefully evaluate alternative methods. The work presented in Appendix C, and summarized below, is intended to help inform agencies about the statistical characteristics of selected bridging methods. Agencies are encouraged to plan and conduct methodological research that will lead to more informed decisions concerning bridging methods and their uses. Such methodological research has long been used to quantify changes in data collection procedures. For example, when methods for coding industry, occupation, or diseases are updated, it is common practice to code data using both sets of coding rules to determine the nature and extent of the changes introduced by the change in procedures.  85   The analyses presented in Appendix C make use of survey data in which the same respondent provided racial information in response to both a question structured under the 1977 standards and to questions similar to those that might be structured under the 1997 standards. These are examples of methodological approaches that can be adopted by agencies, if necessary. In particular, since 1976, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has added a follow-up question for those reporting more than one racial identity, asking them to select the one that they feel best describes them. This information is directly used in some of the most promising bridge techniques. Some agencies may want to use such a follow-up question experimentally to provide valuable, survey-specific information for bridging to the past. As agencies conduct such experiments, the results may assist other agencies in understanding the changes associated with transitioning to the 1997 standards. The results discussed here and in Appendix C represent the work of a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from Federal statistical agencies that use and produce data on race and ethnicity. They have spent the past three years considering these tabulation issues and conducting research to develop tabulation guidelines for constructing ""bridges"" between racial data collected under the 1997 standards and racial data collected under the 1977 standards. The report sets forth criteria by which different bridging methods should be evaluated and describes the different methods that have been considered thus far. The results of the research conducted on several methods for creating bridges are also presented. This part of the report discusses different options for tabulating racial data in order to create bridges from data collected under the 1997 standards, which have five racial categories and permit the reporting of more than one race, back to the data collected under the previous standards, which identified four racial categories and asked respondents to select one. An ""Other"" category appears in much of the analysis, because it is included in the decennial census and some other surveys. All of these methods (and the research on them reported here) involve the use of individual-level records. Analysis is limited to data collected using the separate questions for race and Hispanic origin. Under the 1997 standards, when reporting is based on self-identification, the twoquestion format is to be used; even in the case of observer identification, this is the preferred format. It is expected that some users will bridge to a distribution created using the combined format for the question on race and ethnicity. Thus, bridging both to the old racial distribution arising from the use of two questions and one based on a combined, single question are analyzed. The latter analyses required the creation of a combined distribution from data collected using the two-question format. It should be clearly understood that this is a ""manufactured"" distribution and may be different from one obtained when actually using a combined question format. Based on the research, the strengths and weaknesses of each bridging method are discussed. The last two sections of this chapter discuss weighting data collected under the 86   1997 standards to 1990-based population controls and suggested bridging strategies for users of the new racial and ethnic data. B. Methods for Bridging The goal of developing bridging methodology for data on race is to identify a statistical model that will take individuals' responses to the new questions on race and classify those responses as closely as possible to the responses we hypothesize they would have given using the old single race categories. Such a task will be relatively easy or be more difficult depending on how an individual identifies himself or herself under the 1997 standards. For bridging purposes, individuals with a single racial background are likely to identify as they did before, and no statistical model is needed for bridging. However, those with a mixed racial heritage who were previously required to identify only one part of their background may, under the 1997 standards, choose to report more than one racial identity. When a person identifies with more than one racial group, some model will be necessary to translate those multiple responses into the one, single response we hypothesize that the individual most likely would have reported under the 1977 standards. 1. Framework Several different methods have been identified for creating a single race distribution from data including multiple race responses. These methods vary in both the assumptions that are made and the procedures that are followed. Before describing the particular methods examined in this report, it is useful to describe some of their major underlying characteristics. One major distinction among the methods is whether an individual's responses are assigned to a single racial category (termed whole assignment) or to multiple categories (termed fractional assignment). Whole assignment can be based on a set of deterministic rules or based on some probabilistic distribution. For example, a deterministic rule might assign all White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, while a probabilistic rule might randomly assign 60 percent of the White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, and 40 percent into the White category. In the above example, it is unlikely that all individuals identifying as White and American Indian under the 1997 standards would have previously identified as American Indian, so the deterministic rule will result in misclassifications for all those people who had previously identified as White. With a probabilistic rule, an individual's responses are randomly assigned to either the American Indian category or the White category (such as with 60 percent and 40 percent probabilities, respectively, based on previously collected data). However, even if the overall probabilities matched exactly the aggregate distribution under the 1977 standards, there is no guarantee that the 40 percent who were categorized as White would have classified themselves that way. In fact, in the worst case, 87   all 40 percent who were classified as White would actually have identified as American Indian under the 1977 standards, and a corresponding percentage of those categorized as American Indian would have identified as White. When fractional assignment is used, multiple race responses are categorized into more than one category where each category receives a fraction of a count, and the sum of the fractions equals one. In the above examples of whole assignment, a person's responses were placed into one and only one category, in an attempt to mimic the past. An alternative is to use a deterministic rule to assign some fraction of the multiple race responses to each of the racial categories identified. For example, a multiple response of White and American Indian might count as ""one-half"" in the tabulations for American Indians and ""one-half"" in the tabulations for Whites. These fractions, like the probabilities in the earlier example, could be varied for different combinations of multiple races to attempt to reflect how often people might identify with one group compared with another. 2. Bridge Tabulation Methods All of the bridge tabulation methods focus on the assignment of the responses from individuals who identify with more than one racial group. Responses from individuals who identify with a single racial group under the 1997 standards are assumed to have been the same under the 1977 standards. The response ""Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander"" is assigned to the old racial category of ""Asian or Pacific Islander."" The specific methods for assigning multiple race responses into single race categories are Deterministic Whole Assignment, Deterministic Fractional Assignment, and Probabilistic Whole Assignment. Two sets of results for each of the following tabulation methods are produced. The first set ignores the use of any auxiliary information other than that needed to carry out the particular tabulation method. The other set of results for each method uses the one piece of information that is certain to be common to all data collections done following the 1997 standards, that is, ethnicity. Thus, whether or not an individual is Hispanic is taken into account when a tabulation method is used. Deterministic whole assignment. This method uses fixed, deterministic rules for assigning multiple responses back to one and only one of the racial categories from the 1977 standards. Four alternatives are examined. The first (Smallest Group) assigns responses that include White and another group to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the fewest number of individuals identifying that group as a single race. The second alternative (Largest Group Other Than White) assigns responses that include White with some other racial group, to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the highest single-race 88   count. The third alternative (Largest Group) assigns responses with two or more racial groups into the group with the largest number of individuals as a single race. In this latter case, any combination with White is assigned to the White category, and combinations that do not include White are assigned to the group with the largest single-race count. The fourth alternative (Plurality) assigns responses based on data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS has permitted respondents to select more than one race for a number of years, with only the first two responses captured. However, respondents reporting more than one race were given a follow-up question asking them to select the one race with which they most closely identify (called Main Race here). For these respondents, the proportion choosing each of the two possibilities as their main race was calculated. All responses in a particular multiple-race category using the Plurality method are assigned to the group with the highest proportion of responses on the follow-up question about main race. Deterministic fractional assignment. This method uses fixed, deterministic rules for fractional weighting of multiple-race responses, that is, assigning a fraction to each one of the individual racial categories that are identified. These fractions must sum to 1. Two alternatives are examined. The first (Deterministic Equal Fractions) assigns each of the multiple responses in equal fractions to each racial group identified. Thus, responses with two racial groups are assigned half to each group; those with three groups are assigned one-third to each, etc. The second alternative (Deterministic NHIS Fractions) assigns responses by fractions to each racial group identified, with the fractions drawn from empirical results from the NHIS (as described above). Probabilistic whole assignment. This method uses probabilistic rules for assigning multiple race responses back to one and only one of the previous racial categories. Two alternatives are examined. These parallel the two alternatives discussed under Deterministic Fractional Assignment, except that, for a given set of fractions, the response is assigned to only one racial category. The fractions specify the probabilities used to select a particular category. The first alternative uses equal selection probabilities. The second uses the NHIS fractions where possible, and equal fractions when no information is available from NHIS. Probabilistic Whole Assignment will yield nearly, on average, the same population counts as Deterministic Fractional Assignment. Only the results from Deterministic Fractional Assignment are presented in this report. In practice, there would be a difference between Deterministic Fractional Assignment and Probabilistic Whole Assignment when computing variances for tabulated estimates, and the two methods would yield relatively small differences in distributions for respondent characteristics. In general, Probabilistic Whole Assignment would yield a higher estimated variance than the Deterministic Fractional approach, with the variances for both methods underestimating the true variance. Probabilistic methods which incorporate a ""Multiple Imputation"" statistical technique 89   would result in an unbiased estimate of variance, but at the price of being more difficult to implement (See Rubin 1987.). All Inclusive. A final tabulation method considered is termed the ""All Inclusive"" method. Under this method all responses are used. Responses are assigned to each of the categories that an individual selects. The sum of the categories totals more than 100 percent. C. Methods of Evaluation 1. Data Sources National Health Interview Survey. The NHIS is a continuing nationwide sample survey designed to measure the health status of residents of the United States (Benson and Marano, 1995; Massey et al., 1989). The analysis here uses data from an analytic file that contains three years of NHIS data (1993, 1994, and 1995). For each of these years there were about 45,000 households interviewed, resulting in slightly more than 100,000 individuals per year. The total sample for the bridge analysis is 323,080 (5237 respondents did not provide data on race). Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to choose more than one racial category. As the respondent is handed a card with numbered racial categories, the interviewer asks, ""What is the number of the group or groups that represents your race?"" If a respondent selects more than one category, the interviewer then asks, ""Which of those groups would you say best describes your race?"" Although the listed racial groups have changed over time, for 1993 to 1995, the card shown to respondents included 16 separate racial categories (White, Black, American Indian, Aleut, Eskimo, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Asian Indian, Samoan, Guamanian, and other Asian and Pacific Islander. In addition, although not on the flashcard, respondents were allowed to give an ""other"" race response.) To be consistent, the 16 groups were collapsed to the four previous racial categories: White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN), and Asian or Pacific Islander (API), plus Other. For this analysis, a variable called Detailed Race was created from responses to the first question, which allowed identification with more than one racial group. This information is not included on public use data files of the NHIS. However, on internal files, the first two race groups mentioned are recorded for each observation. Even if a respondent selected more than two groups, only two were recorded on the intermediate file. From the two recorded racial responses, Detailed Race was coded into five single race groups (White, Black, AIAN, API, Other) and 11 multiple race groups (White/Black, White/AIAN, White/API, White/Other, Black/AIAN, Black/API, Black/Other, AIAN/API, AIAN/Other, and API/Other. For most analyses, multiple race combinations that had insufficient numbers were aggregated into the 90   category ""Other Combinations."") Individuals who had two racial groups recorded for Detailed Race but a third group recorded for the ""group that best describes race"" were coded into ""Other Combinations."" The Main Race variable, used as a reference point representing the racial distribution under the 1977 standards, is primarily derived from Detailed Race and the responses to the second question, which asks the respondent for the group that best describes his/her race (Benson and Marano, 1995). For respondents who selected one Detailed Race group, Main Race is the same as Detailed Race. For respondents who selected more than one racial group, Main Race is the one group reported as best describing their race. Some respondents who had chosen more than one race for the Detailed Race question responded as ""Multiple race"" or ""Other"" for the Main Race question. For this analysis, these responses were combined into the ""Other"" category. Categories for Main Race were White, Black, AIAN, API, and Other. The combined race and ethnicity variable, referred to here as ""Combined Main Race,"" uses the respondent's answer to an Hispanic origin question to reassign the respondent to the Hispanic category. The Hispanic origin question used is the following: Are any of these groups (the respondent's) national origin or ancestry? At the same time, the interviewer hands the respondent a card listing Hispanic groups as categories: Puerto Rican, Mexican, Cuban, Mexican American, Chicano, Other Latin American, and Other Spanish. For this report, Whites, Blacks, Others, and those reporting more than one race who identified with any of the Hispanic groups were categorized as Hispanic and not according to their race. Asians, American Indians, and Alaska Natives were not reclassified. If a respondent did not answer the Hispanic origin question, he or she was assumed to be non-Hispanic. May 1995 Supplement on Race and Ethnicity to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The May 1995 CPS Supplement was one in a series of studies conducted for the Federal agencies' review of the standards for data on race and ethnicity. The Supplement was designed to address the following issues: (1) the effect of having a ""multiracial"" race category among the list of races; (2) the effect of adding ""Hispanic"" to the list of racial categories; and (3) the preferences for alternative names for racial and ethnic categories (e.g., African-American for Black, and Latino for Hispanic). The Supplement was organized into four panels representing a two-by-two experimental design for studying the first and second issues outlined above. Each panel was given to one-fourth of the sample, or about 15,000 households (30,000 individuals). All respondents in a household received the same set of questions; household members 15 years and older were asked to respond for themselves, and parents answered for children under 15. Only two of the panels in the CPS Supplement permitted respondents to report in a multiracial category (panels 2 and 4), and only one panel had separate race and Hispanic origin questions (panel 2) as ultimately recommended in the 1997 standards. Therefore, panel 2 data were used 91   to analyze the effects of the different tabulation methods for the two-question format. The new Hispanic question, preceding the race question, simply asked whether or not the respondent was Hispanic. The smaller sample (about 30,000 observations) hampers analysis and generalizations when the focus is on the small portion of the sample (about 1 percent) who identified as ""multiracial."" There are additional limitations to these data for evaluating the bridging methods. The option respondents were given to identify multiple races in the CPS Supplement was a multiracial category with a follow-up question asking respondents to indicate all the racial groups with which they identified. The 1997 standards allow people to identify directly with all the racial groups they choose and do not include a ""multiracial"" category. Furthermore, a large percentage of individuals who chose the multiracial category in panel 2 of the Supplement did not specify more than one racial group (see Tucker et al., 1996). For purposes of this evaluation, individuals were classified as belonging to the specific racial categories they identified. Those who identified as being multiracial but then did not give two or more specific racial groups were reclassified in the one racial category they gave. Thus, the distribution of the CPS Supplement data reported here differs from that which was published in earlier reports, which classified as multiracial any person who identified with the multiracial category even if they only specified one racial group. This new distribution is referred to here as the ""Edited Distribution."" This edited distribution was used with the various tabulation methods. As in NHIS, the resulting distributions were compared to a reference distribution based on the respondents' original answers (in the first CPS interview) to the race question that followed the 1977 standards. The combined race and ethnicity format, still referred to as the reference distribution in the relevant tables, uses the respondent's answer to the Hispanic origin question to reassign the respondent to the Hispanic category. For this report, Whites, Blacks, Others, and those reporting more than one race who identified with any of the Hispanic groups were categorized as Hispanic and not according to their race. Asians, American Indians, and Alaska Natives were not reclassified. If a respondent did not answer the Hispanic origin question, he or she was assumed to be non-Hispanic. 1998 Washington State Population Survey. The 1998 Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) was designed to provide information on Washington residents between decennial censuses. The survey collected data on employment, income, education, and health, along with basic demographic information. The WSPS was done by telephone and included 7,279 households with telephones. Blacks, Asians, Hispanics and American Indians were over sampled. The designated respondent was the individual with the greatest knowledge about the household. The respondent weights reflect this over sampling and, thus, results are representa-  92   tive of the Washington population as a whole. The response rate for the entire sample was between 50 and 60 percent. Information about the race of the respondent was collected twice during the course of the interview. At the beginning of the survey, the respondent was asked, ""Are you of Hispanic origin?"" Following that question, the respondent was asked, ""What is your race?"" The categories were the ones appearing under the 1977 standards, but the order was as follows: Black; American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; Asian or Pacific Islander; and White. An ""Other"" category also was allowed, and the interviewer recorded the verbatim response on a ""specify"" line. Near the end of the survey, the respondent was asked race questions conforming to the 1997 standards. Besides the same Hispanic origin question, the respondent was asked to specify country of origin. For race, the respondent was asked to select one or more categories. This time the ordering of the categories was White; Black or African American (or Haitian or Negro); American Indian or Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Asian. Again, an ""Other"" category was provided. There also was a follow-up question for Asian respondents to specify country of origin. The results from the race question at the end of the survey were used with the tabulation methods. The reference distribution came from the answers to the original race question. A combined race/ethnicity format was not created from the WSPS data because unedited information from the race question using the 1977 format was unavailable. 2. Advantages and Disadvantages of These Data Sources Only the Washington State data closely resemble the way the question on race will be asked under the 1997 standards. Yet, all three can offer insights into the relationship between how individuals will actually respond to the 1997 question on race and how they responded to the question under the 1977 standards. The NHIS and the CPS Supplement are nationally representative, and the Washington State data serve as an example for evaluating the tabulation methods at the state level. Simulations using 1990 census data also were conducted, but the results differed little from those for the other data sets. At this point, it is believed that an analysis of data from the 1998 Dress Rehearsal for Census 2000 would be of greater utility. Furthermore, the Dress Rehearsal data will provide examples of the effects of the 1997 standards at the local level. Thus, this analysis will be included in the next version of this report. 3. Description of New Analyses The analyses concentrated on the bridge tabulation methods. These analyses can be divided into three broad areas: (1) descriptions of racial distributions under the alternative bridging tabulation methods; (2) rates of racial ""misclassification"" for these alternatives; and, (3) sensitivity of outcome measures to the bridging alternatives.  93   Distribution of Race. For the first phase of the analysis (using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the data from Washington State), the distributions of race under the allocation alternatives described previously were calculated: All Inclusive, Deterministic Whole Allocation (Smallest Group, Largest Group Other Than White, Largest Group, and Plurality) and Fractional Allocation (Equal Fractions and NHIS Fractions). These new distributions were compared to the reference distribution in each data set. At this time, it is unknown what percentage of people in the United States will identify with more than one racial group when given the opportunity to do so in Census 2000 and in subsequent surveys. For purposes of illustrating the effects of a greater proportion of individuals identifying more than one racial background, analyses were conducted increasing the proportion of multiple race responses two-, four-, six- and eight-fold using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State micro data sources. The racial distributions were compared using each of the tabulation methods to see effects with increasing levels of reporting more than one race. Of necessity, these tabulations assume that the increases are the same across the different combinations of more than one race. The accuracy of this assumption cannot be tested. The purpose of these analyses is not to attempt to make accurate predictions about the extent of multiple race reporting or its composition, but rather to see more clearly possible differences among tabulation methods that may become apparent only with a greater percentage of more than one race reporting. Misclassification of Race. Besides evaluating the overall racial distributions produced by the tabulation methods, the misclassification of individuals also needs to be examined. For the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State survey, these misclassification rates were formed by comparing an individual's answer to the race question under the 1977 standards to the assigned category of the individual's response(s) to the race question under the 1997 standards using each of the tabulation methods. The misclassification rate and its standard error for each race by tabulation method were produced. Preliminary Outcomes Assessment. In the last phase of the analysis, the impact of multiplerace reporting on outcome measures was assessed. This process is important because users in many of the Federal agencies are not typically examining race distributions, but rather trends and indicators for the Nation (e.g., health outcomes, economic well-being, educational attainment) across racial groups. This is where the majority of work will need to be done within individual agencies as the 1997 standards are implemented. An initial examination of how common statistics could be affected by reporting of more than one race was conducted. Five outcome measures were examined, three from the NHIS and two from the CPS Supplement. From the NHIS, three routine health outcomes were calculated: percent of respondents in poor or fair health, percent of children living with a single mother, and percent of respondents with no health insurance. From the CPS Supplement, the proportions of respondents who were unemployed and the labor force participation rates for different racial groups were calculated. These estimates based on the bridging alternatives are not meant to be precise measures of these 94   factors, but are used to demonstrate the possible impact reporting of multiple races and the tabulation methods may have on these and similar estimates. D. Examination of the Results with Respect to the Evaluation Criteria Bridging to the past will be needed for measuring change in a variety of circumstances. Besides measuring population growth, any number of economic, social, and health outcomes must be monitored. This work will involve different population groups at different levels of geography. As a first step toward providing the information users will need to make informed decisions about the methods, the strengths and weaknesses of the bridging methods with respect to the evaluation criteria outlined at the beginning of this report are discussed, based on the results of the statistical analyses conducted. The details of these statistical analyses can be found in Appendix C. Measure Change Over Time. As indicated earlier, measuring change over time is the criterion that is of greatest importance in evaluating the bridging methods. The first and second phases of the analysis shed light on the performance of the various methods in this area. In essence, an ideal bridging method in this case is one that not only accurately recreates the population distribution under the 1977 standards such that the only difference remaining is a function of true change over time, but also assigns an individual's response to the old category that would have been chosen. The methodology used in these studies allows users, within limits, to see how well the bridging methods using racial data collected under the 1997 standards can match data from the same respondents collected (at about the same time) under the 1977 standards. To the extent that there is a match, any change that would occur from this point forward would indicate true change. If the match is poor, it is not possible to isolate the true change. When comparing the different methods to their reference distributions (whether using only the race question or the combined format), the racial categories that were most sensitive to which method is chosen were the numerically small ones, particularly the AIAN category. While different data sets were used in each study and the racial questions were not the same, the studies indicate that the Largest Group Deterministic Whole Assignment method, the Plurality method, and the two Deterministic Fractional Assignment methods produce distributions closer to the reference distributions than do the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method. Controlling for ethnicity had no effect on these results. One reason the Largest Group Assignment method results are so close is that it has little effect on the smaller racial groups, because most assignments are made to Black or White, and the percentages for these two races are so large that the relatively small increase they receive is not noticeable. The Plurality method produces a good fit, because it makes assignments at the level of specific racial combinations. The performance of the NHIS Fractional Assignment method can be discounted to a degree in the NHIS study because the analysis is somewhat circular; however, the results 95   from the CPS Supplement and the Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) show this method yields a relatively close match. The Equal Fractional Assignment method produces a reasonable match in these studies. The primary reason that the other two Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method do not perform as well is that they alter the White percentage to some extent and substantially increase the percentage in the AIAN category. In the case of misclassification rates, some contradictory results emerge, both when using the race question alone and when using the combined format. While the AIAN and ""Other"" categories have high misclassification rates across all tabulation methods in the CPS Supplement, the same is not true for the other two surveys. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment methods produce the most comparable results for the AIAN category in both surveys and for the ""Other"" category in the WSPS; however, these methods have higher overall misclassification rates. Both the CPS Supplement and the WSPS have large misclassification rates for these two categories when using many of the tabulation methods. When the distributions of the outcome variables are examined, all methods produce comparable, and relatively close matches for all health outcomes. For the AIAN unemployment rate, the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method appear to produce the least comparable results, but none of the differences is significant. There are significant differences in the AIAN labor force participation rates for several of the tabulation methods. It is likely that which method is best at matching a reference distribution for outcome measures will depend on the outcome being examined. Unfortunately, the data to assess the best tabulation method for each outcome may never be readily available. All of these conclusions should these studies. It is unclear how these responses could differ by Furthermore, most of this work samples at that. be viewed with caution. Many assumptions had to be made in people will respond to the new racial question in the future, and mode of data collection and with the subject of the survey. on developing bridging methods relied on sample data, and small  Congruence with Respondent's Choice. This criterion concerns how well the full range of the respondent's choices is represented in the racial distribution. It is more important for evaluating ongoing tabulations under the 1997 standards, but the bridging methods can be differentiated with respect to this criterion, too. None of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods takes into account the full range of the respondent's selections, but the Plurality method at least controls for the particular racial combination chosen by the respondent under the 1997 standards. The All Inclusive method accurately reflects all selections by tabulating actual responses and not people. The Equal Fraction Assignment method tabulates people, but, like the All Inclusive method, treats all responses equally. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method takes all 96   responses into account, but assignment is based on attempting to estimate in which single-race category the respondent would prefer to be counted. Range of Applicability. This criterion refers to how well the bridging method can be applied in different contexts. The All Inclusive method provides the same results in every context, because assignment does not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution. This method is not suitable for users who need a distribution that adds to 100 percent. Of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods, the Largest Group Assignment method is the least sensitive to context and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are as easy to use as the Largest Group Whole Assignment method, but the results for the small racial categories will vary to a greater extent with the context, particularly according to level of geography. The Equal Fraction Assignment method is as generalizable as the All Inclusive method, but it is not quite as easy to use. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method may be the most problematic, because they currently represent only a national preference distribution based on data from 1993 to 1995. The use of this distribution at the local level would be likely to produce inaccurate results in a number of cases. That is not to say that the other methods do not face the same problem. Meet Confidentiality and Reliability Standards. Because these methods all attempt to reproduce the racial categories under the 1977 standards, the same confidentiality problems that existed over the last 20 years will continue to exist. No increase in problems is anticipated. In the case of reliability, however, the situation is different. The All Inclusive method will not produce less reliable data than data produced under the 1977 standards. The Equal Fraction Assignment method may have reliability problems as a result of adding only fractional counts to some of the smaller categories if these categories have a high probability of being chosen as the preferred single race. The same would be true if equal fractions were used to make whole assignments. In sample surveys, the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods will have reliability problems to the extent that there is a large variance on the individual race proportions. This is likely to occur when small samples are involved. The Largest Group Whole assignment method should have the fewest problems with respect to reliability, and the Smallest Group Whole Assignment method will likely have the most. These methods have another problem, however, in that an individual's response may be assigned to different categories at different levels of geography. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method, as well as methods where fractions are used for whole assignment (i.e., the Plurality method), is based upon a sample distribution with its own variance properties. Reliability for the very small combinations will be quite bad unless many years of data are combined, and this presents its own problems. Minimize Disruptions to the Single Race Distributions. This criterion is relevant only for evaluation of bridging methods. Its purpose is to see how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the 1997 standards. To the extent 97   that a bridging method can meet the other bridging criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportions in the ongoing distribution, it will have value for looking both forward and backward in time. An evaluation of the different methods according to this criterion involves the comparison of the bridge distributions to the detailed race distribution under the 1997 standards in each case. For the CPS Supplement, the Plurality method is marginally closer than the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the Fractional methods. While the All Inclusive method and the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods match for the White category, they differ substantially from the single-race AIAN category in the detailed distribution and are marginally worse for the API category. The NHIS Fractional method is the closest in both the NHIS and WSPS. Statistically Defensible. To be statistically defensible, the bridging method must conform to acceptable statistical conventions. The All Inclusive method makes no assumption about how respondents would assign themselves in the single race situation. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method are based on an observed distribution, and, to that extent, involve less judgment than the rest of the methods that assign people and not responses. While the Equal Fractional Assignment method is based on judgment, it does not make assumptions about the relative importance of any given race. The Largest Group Whole Assignment method does assign greater importance to one of the races, but it also follows common, but different, statistical practice than the equal fraction approach. Both attempt to minimize the error in assignment. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment method and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment method do not follow statistical practice, but, instead, rely on the historical record of discrimination; even in these cases, however, the assigned category is based on an observed distribution. Ease of Use. ""Ease of use"" refers to how complicated it is to produce the bridge results. The Equal Fractional Assignment method makes assignments that do not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution at hand. It and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method do require the duplication of individual records or the creation, on every record, of a variable for each racial category under the 1977 standards in order to be able to assign fractions for any combination of categories. If the fractional methods are used to assign a respondent to a single category (whole probabilistic methods), this cumbersome process can be avoided. The All Inclusive method, like the Equal Fractional method, does not depend on the particular distribution, but it does produce proportions that add to more than 100 percent unless they are raked or recalculated to a base of 100 percent each time. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the NHIS Fractional method would require an extra step unless only national figures are used, because the relative size of the groups must be determined for each detailed distribution. Otherwise, they are as easy to use as the whole probabilistic methods. 98   Skill Required. This criterion refers to the skills required to carry out the bridge operations. The amount of computer expertise to perform the operations associated with each of these methods is fairly trivial. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods require almost no statistical knowledge. Some familiarity with the statistical adjustment literature would be useful for understanding the Deterministic Fractional Assignment procedures. If the All Inclusive method were used, users might need to understand statistical raking. Understandability and Communicability. This criterion concerns how easily the methods can be explained and understood by the average user. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are both easy to explain and easy to understand. The fractional assignment of individuals to a single category also is not difficult to follow. Assigning fractions of a person to different categories may be easy to explain, but the average user may find it difficult to accept the idea. The All Inclusive method also is easily explained, but, unless the percentages are raked to 100 percent, users may have a problem understanding how to use the results. E. Weighting When Appropriate Population Controls Are Not Available For those using the new racial categories in surveys prior to the release of new population controls from Census 2000 (expected in 2002), a method is needed to allow the use of the updated 1990 controls. The following advice is provided for researchers who find themselves in this situation: 1. 2. 3. 4. Choose a whole-allocation bridging method. Create a bridged distribution using the chosen method. Rake this bridged distribution to the 1990-based controls. Use the final weight from this process when reporting distributions for the new racial categories, including the multiple-race combinations. 5. Provide the following caveats to data users: (a) weighting was not done using controls based on the new definitions, and (b) the bridged distribution is not necessarily the same as would have been obtained using the old race question. Choosing a whole-allocation bridging method will simplify the task. Data producers should select the bridging method that they judge to be the most appropriate for their data users. Provide any available information to evaluate the likely discrepancies between the bridged distribution and the distribution that would have been obtained using the old question. Reweighting to the new controls, once they become available, is strongly recommended.  99   F. Strategies for Users This section suggests strategies for bridging that depend on the user's needs. In providing these strategies, two assumptions are made. The first is that the user is interested in the analysis of an historical data series. The second assumption follows from the first, and it is that the user will not simply be doing cross-sectional estimates of the current counts in the racial categories or the present and future characteristics of these populations. It should be noted that all of the bridging methods would require, to some extent, prior knowledge of population characteristics when working at the local level. If the user wants to examine change across the whole racial distribution, the Plurality method or one of the Fractional Allocation methods will likely provide the best approximations to the distributions from the past. They actually are based on information concerning how the respondents would have answered the question on race under the previous standards. While the new distribution should reflect only the growth in the racial categories due to population change and not methodological change, most of the other methods produce a substantial increase in the size of the American Indian and Alaska Native population not attributable to change over time. Accompanying the increase in the AIAN category is a corresponding decrease in the White category. Other distortions could occur as the size of the population identifying with more than one race grows. If the user is interested in a particular racial category, which method is chosen will depend on whether the user wants to err on the side of inclusion or exclusion, especially for the smaller racial groups. Use of the Smallest Group method or the Largest Group Other Than White method will include a substantial number of individuals that might have identified with the larger racial group in the past. The characteristics of the group might change simply as a result of their inclusion. This is particularly the case for the AIAN category, and the differences between methods with respect to inclusion or exclusion will be greatest in areas having a large AIAN population, such as the state of Washington. Analysis of the combined race/ethnicity format indicates that the choice of tabulation method has little effect on Hispanics. It should be remembered, however, that these results are based on the use of a ""manufactured"" variable and may not truly represent what would occur if an actual combined format had been used in the past. It is also the case that the AIAN category is still affected by the choice of bridging method when using the combined format. The choice of bridging method also could depend on the substantive characteristics of interest. Some characteristics may not be affected by the particular bridging method chosen. Others will show more change with one method or another. In these cases, which bridging method is used  100   will depend upon what the user is trying to discover. As noted above, health outcomes appeared not to be affected by the choice of bridging method, but economic outcomes were. Geographic characteristics also could affect the choice of bridging method. The user may have knowledge of local populations that would dictate which method should be used. For instance, the user might know that in a particular area Whites also are likely to identify as American Indian when given the opportunity, but, if forced to select a single race, they would almost certainly choose White. This knowledge might lead the user to use a bridging method that minimizes assignment to the American Indian and Alaska Native category. The fact that the Smallest Group method and the Largest Group Other Than White method give larger counts for the smaller racial groups might favor their selection in some circumstances. Reliability and confidentiality standards normally would restrict the analysis of these categories. Even though these bridging methods may produce less than ideal comparisons to the past, the larger size of the categories resulting from using these methods could increase analytical power enough to draw conclusions. Although the selection of a bridging method should be for substantive or methodological reasons, simplicity cannot be discounted altogether. Users must have both the substantive knowledge and methodological skill to use the more complicated methods. They also must be able to explain them and defend them.  101   References Benson, V. and Marano, M.

The increase in the number of owner-occupied homes in the United States (10.8 million, 18.3 percent) far outpaced the change in the rental inventory (2.7 million, 8.3 percent) during the 1990s.

While the majority of occupied units in all 50 states were owner occupied, about 3 out of 4 households in West Virginia (75.2 percent) and Minnesota (74.6 percent) owned their homes. As in 1990, New York ranked at the bottom with respect to homeownership (53.0 percent) in 2000. Renters outnumbered owners in Washington, DC, where about 2 out of 5 (40.8 percent) were homeowners. Nevada, Arizona, and Idaho also posted high growth in their stock of rental units, adding respectively, 39.4 percent, 24.0 percent, and 20.1 percent more rental units since 1990. The rental inventories in four states (Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, and Michigan) remained relatively unchanged between 1990 and 2000, while the rental inventory in the District of Columbia declined 3.5 percent. One in ten homes in the South were vacant on Census Day. With 9 percent of United States housing vacant in 2000, regional rates ranged from less than 8 percent in the West to more than 10 percent in the South. Three states in the Northeast, four in the South, and six in the West had total vacancy rates that exceeded 12 percent. Housing markets were especially ""tight"" (less than 7 percent of units were vacant) in five states: California, Illinois, Connecticut, Iowa, and Massachusetts. Many states with a higher-than-average proportion of vacant units had a sizeable number of homes classified as ""Vacant -- for seasonal, recreational, and occasional use"" in Census 2000 (see Table 2). These units make up a class commonly referred to as ""vacation"" homes, U.S. Census Bureau  Midwest  70.2  29.8  South  68.4  31.6  West  61.5  38.5  Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 Summary File 1.  18.1 percent) contributed the balance of the homeowner inventory. Among the 35.7 million renteroccupied units in the United States, about a third (12.3 million, 34.4 percent) were located in the South and about 8.4 million (23.5 percent) in the West. The remaining renter-occupied homes were about evenly distributed between the Northeast (7.6 million, 21.4 percent) and the Midwest (7.4 million, 20.6 percent). Among the states, Nevada showed the largest percentage gain in housing units between 1990 and 2000. The housing stock in Nevada increased 59.5 percent in the 1990s, from 519,000 to 827,000. Other western states with rapid increases in their housing inventories were Arizona (31.9 percent), Utah (28.4 percent), and Idaho (27.7 percent). California led the country in the total number of housing units in the United States in 2000 (12.2 million) and grew by more than 1.0 million units (9.2 percent) over the course of the decade. 4  In the South, North Carolina led the way with a 25.0 percent increase in the number of housing units, closely followed by Georgia (24.4 percent) and South Carolina (23.1 percent). Florida added 1.2 million units, the largest absolute gain among the 50 states, and increased its stock of housing by 19.7 percent between 1990 and 2000. Housing growth below the 10-percent level in the South was evident in just three states -- Louisiana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The remaining states in the region all posted gains above the national level of 13.3 percent. The housing stock in the District of Columbia, however, declined slightly (-1.3 percent) from its 1990 level. Housing growth in states in the Northeast (6.6 percent) and the Midwest (10.1 percent) was generally somewhat slower than the national pace (13.3 percent). Connecticut and North Dakota (both about 5 percent) were considerably below the national level.   Table 2.

Two other metropolitan areas in Michigan -- Jackson and SaginawBay City-Midland -- joined Barnstable-Yarmouth (Massachusetts), Houma (Louisiana), and Sharon (Pennsylvania) to round out the list. In only five metropolitan areas were owners outnumbered by renters. These included the two large Northeastern primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) -- Jersey City, New Jersey (30.7 percent) and New York, New York (34.7 percent) -- and two PMSAs on the West Coast -- Los Angeles-Long Beach (47.9 percent) and San Francisco (49.0 percent). The fifth metropolitan area where fewer households owned (45.6 percent) rather than rented was Bryan-College Station, Texas, home of Texas A&M University. Renters outnumbered owners in many of our country's largest cities. In the four largest United States cities in 2000, most households were renters. About 70 percent of households in New York City, 61 percent in Los Angeles, 56 perTable 3.

Although many analysts have used this category to estimate the number of second homes in a given area, the category also includes units occupied on an occasional basis as corporate apartments and other temporary residences where all the household members reported that their residence was elsewhere. On a percentage basis, three northern New England states -- Maine (15.6 percent), Vermont (14.6 percent), and New Hampshire (10.3 percent) -- topped the list. Florida is the clear leader in the number of these seasonal, recreational, and occasional-use properties (483,000), followed by California (237,000), New York (235,000), and Michigan (234,000). Homeowners were a majority in nearly all United States counties. In 2000, owners outnumbered renters in all but 36 (1.1 percent) of the 3,141 counties and equivalent areas. Homeownership was fairly uncommon among households living in New York City, where only U.S. Census Bureau  1 in 5 households (19.6 percent) in Bronx and (20.1 percent) in New York (Manhattan) counties and about 1 in 3 (34.3 percent) in Kings County (Brooklyn) were homeowners. Other counties with homeownership rates below 30 percent were Chattahoochee in Georgia (27.0 percent), Aleutians West Census Area (a county equivalent) in Alaska (27.8 percent), and the very small county of Kalawao on the island of Molokai in Hawaii where all 115 occupied housing units were rented. Alcona County in Michigan (89.9 percent) and Elbert County in Colorado (89.6 percent) topped the list in terms of the highest proportion of households who owned their homes. Other counties notable for their high rates of ownership (about 89 percent) were Powhatan and New Kent Counties in Virginia and Keweenaw County in Michigan. Florida's metropolitan areas were leaders in terms of homeownership. Five areas in the Sunshine State -- Punta Gorda, Ocala, Fort Pierce-Port St. Lucie, Sarasota-Bradenton, and Fort Myers-Cape Coral -- were among the top ten metropolitan areas with the largest proportions  Ten Metropolitan Areas With the Highest Percentage of OwnerOccupied Units: 2000 (For information on confidentiality protection, nonsampling error, and definitions, see www.census.gov/prod/ cen2000/doc/sf1.pdf) Metropolitan area Punta Gorda, FL . . . . . . . . . . . .

About 4 out of 5 married-couple families owned their homes in 2000. Empty nesters and other married couples without children under the age of 18 were more likely (84.8 percent) than married couples with children (76.9 percent) to own their homes. More than half (55.4 percent) of the families maintained by men without spouses were homeowners, compared with about half (49.6 percent) of families maintained by women without spouses. In 2000, were people living alone more likely to own or rent their homes? The answer depends on the gender of the householder. In 2000, more women (15.5 million) than men (11.8 million) lived alone. Approximately 8.7 million (56.0 percent) of women who lived alone owned their homes, compared with 5.5 million (47.0 percent) of the lone male householders. What proportion of United States households were comprised of two or more unrelated people, and are these households more likely to rent or own their homes? The Census Bureau uses the term ""nonfamily households"" to include people living alone as well as those householders who only live with people who are not related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. In 2000, the 6.5 million householders who lived with other unrelated individuals represented about 6 percent of all United States occupied households. About 2 out of 5 (39.5 percent) of these householders owned their homes.

Renters were also a majority (56.8 percent) of households in Dallas, the eighth largest city in 2000 (see Table 4). Households in San Diego were almost evenly split  between renters (50.5 percent) and owners (49.5 percent). Homeownership was more common among the remaining largest cities in 2000 -- Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Detroit.  Table 5.

Homeownership was directly related to the age of the householder. The youngest householder age group (under 25 years of age) had the lowest level of homeownership (17.9 percent). The percentage of homeowners increased to 45.6 among householders between the ages of 25 and 34 and continued to increase up to a peak of about 81 percent for householders 65 to 74 years of age.

Data on vacant units are needed by federal and local agencies in order to evaluate the overall state of housing markets. The federal government uses this information to allocate Section 8 and other housing program subsidies that assist Americans to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Local organizations use the information to assess neighborhood stability and to plan road, health, and transportation improvements in their communities.

Introduction    The Current Population Survey (CPS) provides labor force estimates for various demographic groups at the national and state levels. It is a monthly survey of about 50,000 housing units that is conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Census (BOC) for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It is also the vehicle for supplements collecting national information on income, poverty, and other topics. The CPS sampling frame is based on the list of addresses for the decennial census, updated for new construction. Additionally, data from the census are used in CPS stratification and estimation.    The American Community Survey (ACS) is a new program that is meant to collect census ""long form"" type data giving basic population characteristics continuously throughout the decade. Starting in 2003, the ACS will use a rolling sample of about 250,000 different housing units per month, spread evenly throughout the country, based on a continuously updated address list. Both the regular availability of ""census"" type data and the updated address list provide opportunities and additional flexibility for the CPS design and estimates.    In this paper, we discuss some of the most promising opportunities. The two major opportunities include uses of ACS data to improve CPS design in terms of selection of housing units from an updated list, and adjusting various stages of weighting. In addition, ACS provides the ability to target CPS sample to households with specific demographic characteristics, and greater flexibility to expand the CPS sample as needed. The greatest potential benefit to BLS from the ACS, because of its large sample size of 3,000,000 addresses per year, lies in enhancements of the models for labor force estimates at the state and sub-state levels. The demand for timely and good quality local data is ever increasing, especially in light of the passage of the Workforce Investment Act. Issues and concerns such as coverage of the updated lists and measurement error are also discussed.    We start by giving a brief description of the CPS and ACS sample designs, respectively, in Sections II and III. In Section IV, we discuss the use of an updated Master Address File (MAF) for ACS. In Section V, we discuss use of ACS to improve the various stages of weighting in CPS. Next in Section VI, we compare and contrast the labor force questions and data collection procedures, including reference period, of the two surveys. In Section VII, we state possible methodologies to reconcile or calibrate ACS to agree with CPS at the national level for civilian labor force statistics, including unemployment rates. In Section VIII, we mention some methods to improve state and sub-state labor force estimates. Finally in Section IX, we conclude with some thoughts for future areas of research.    II. CPS Sample Design    The CPS is conducted monthly using a probability sample of about 50,000 housing units. Each housing unit is in the sample for 4 consecutive months, out of the sample for 8 consecutive months, and then back in sample for the next 4 months; this is known as 4-8-4 rotation. This rotation yields a 75 percent month-to-month sample overlap and 50 percent overlap with the same month a year ago. Generally, the data for the first and fifth months-in-sample are collected by personal interviews while for other months interviews are over the telephone; computerized instruments are used to collect data; and all interviewers go through extensive training. The reference period for the survey is the week containing the 12 th  day of the month and data collection occurs during the week of the month that includes the 19 th ; generally, the data are published the first Friday of the month following the reference period. That is, CPS provides timely estimates with measurable reliability of employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the labor force, as well as information on persons not in the labor force; this information is provided for demographic groups (age, sex, race, ethnicity, etc.).    After each decennial census, the sample is redesigned and a new sample of housing units is selected for the coming decade. A brief overview of the sample design is given below.    The CPS has a state-based design that is augmented to meet national reliability requirements; the design assumes a 6 percent unemployment rate. The first design requirement specifies that coefficient of variation (c.v.) is 8 percent or lower on annual average unemployment rates for each of the 50 States, District of Columbia, and several sub-state areas. The substate areas are: the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area, the balance of California; New York City (5 boroughs), and the balance of New York State. After this requirement is satisfied, then the remaining sample is distributed in a manner that would minimize c.v. on the national monthly unemployment rate to about 1.9 percent. This translates into a 0.2 percentage point change in the monthly unemployment rate being significant at a 90 percent confidence level. For most states, a difference of 0.8 percentage point in the annual average unemployment rate is significant at the 90 percent confidence level, while for month-to-month change, in the unemployment rate, a change of 1.6 percentage points is significant.    The CPS is a stratified systematic sample of housing unit (HU) clusters. In the first stage of sampling, large geographic areas called primary sampling units (PSU) are selected in each state. The most populous PSUs are selected with certainty, while smaller or non-self-representing PSUs are stratified and sampled with a probability proportional to size. Within sampled PSUs, decennial census blocks are sorted. There are two types of blocks. About three-fourths are address list blocks where direct use is made of decennial census address lists to create and sample ultimate sampling units (USU) defined as a cluster of four contiguous (or nearby) HUs. The other blocks require area-based sampling techniques. To keep the CPS sample up-to-date for either type of block, new construction HUs are located and sampled, usually using lists of HUs obtained from permit offices. In the second stage, USUs are systematically sampled within each PSU at intervals that vary by PSU. At present, the entire sample of USUs or HUs is selected to span a decade.         The basic form of the CPS estimator is:  ; where w i  is the final weight that consists of several factors associated with various stages of weight adjustments in the CPS estimation process. The final weight at time t is defined as: w i  = w psu  x w hu  x w s  x w ni  x w 1st  x w 2nd , where,    i = domain or population of interest   w psu  = weight associated with the selection of PSU (it is 1.000 for self representing PSUs and the inverse of the probability of selection for non-self representing PSUs)   w hu  = weight of a household or person within a PSU   w s  = special weight for the person’s USU or HU, to account for subsampling in the field   w ni  = noninterview adjustment weight for the HU   w 1st  = first-stage ratio adjustment for the person   w 2nd  = second-stage ratio adjustment for the person with built-in composite weights   x i  = person possessing characteristic of interest (1 or 0)    For item nonresponse, a hot deck imputation procedure is used (see CPS Technical Paper 63).    III. ACS Sample Design    Starting in 2003, the ACS will mail to about 250,000 addresses at the start of each month, selected from an updated MAF (Master Address File). After two mailings during the month, an attempt is made to conduct the interview by telephone during the next month. In the third month, one-third of the remaining nonrespondents are contacted in person. The reference period is defined as the week preceding the date on which the respondent completed the form. Thus, the March data consist of mail returns from the March mailout, telephone follow-up (and some late mail returns) from the February mailout, and personal visit follow-up from the January mailout. This pattern is repeated each month. For occupied units, we expect that about 60 percent will be interviewed by mail, 10 percent by telephone, and one-third of the remaining 30 percent in person, with each of the last group receiving a tripled weight.    Each address is in sample one time, and not eligible again until five years later. Thus the sample cumulates to 3,000,000 addresses each year, and to about 15,000,000 over a five year period. The survey will be in all counties each month. The data are weighted to make annual average estimates. The population totals by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin are controlled to be consistent with the official intercensal population estimates. Details on the ACS weighting are given in Alexander, Dahl, and Weidman (1997).    The ACS sample size is sufficient to make useful annual estimates for areas down to about 65,000 population. For smaller areas, several years of data may be cumulated. For very small areas, such as census tracts, which average about 4,000 population, cumulating five years of data is typically required. This gives precision close to that of the census long form sample.    The questionnaire content will be similar to that of the decennial census long form. A description of the content, and other aspects of the ACS data design, and testing plans are given on the Census website  www.census.gov . One important feature is that the survey uses a ""current residence"" rule: each person is counted as a resident where he/she is currently living or staying, with the exception of short stays (two months or less) away from a ""usual residence.""         IV. Master Address File    The Master Address File, used in Census 2000, linked to the TIGER geographic information system, will be kept up-to-date after the census. For areas containing about 80 percent of the addresses, the main source of updates will be the Postal Service Delivery Sequence File; new addresses will be added twice a year using a computer match, supplemented by a clerical operation.    In the remaining (""non-city-style"") areas, where the mail delivery addresses do not correspond to a house number and street name, most new addresses will come from a new Community Address Updating System (CAUS).    Field representatives using an automated listing and mapping instrument will verify and locate addresses obtained from local governments. This will be supplemented by ""targeted listing"" based on a combination of field observations, centralized administrative records counts, and local sources. The targeted listing methods will also be used to enhance the coverage of the Delivery Sequence File in the ""city-style"" areas.    The CAUS is currently being tested, and will go into full operation in 2002. There will be an ongoing area sample to measure the coverage of the MAF, and supply a coverage improvement sample of any omitted addresses. Our evidence, from ACS estimates using similar updating methods, and from Ott, et al (1997), suggests that the coverage of CAUS will be fairly complete. The main exception is expected to be several months lag in updating the most recent new construction. The Delivery Sequence File, and some of the sources for targeting listing, may only pick up units once they have been built and occupied. The CPS sample is currently updated using building permits, which can be sampled before the unit is even built. A study is underway to match the MAF and the CPS building permit sample to measure this lag.    Partly because of the concern about the coverage of recently built units, the main CPS sample will continue to be updated using building permits rather than the updates from the Delivery Sequence File and CAUS.    V. ACS to Improve CPS Design    Using ACS or any other data source to update the PSUs more than once a decade is impractical both in terms of costs and data quality; that is, it is disruptive in terms of hiring/firing interviewers, training new interviewers, etc. The ACS and MAF, however, have the potential to considerably improve sampling of USUs or HUs within PSUs. As mentioned earlier, the CPS sample for the entire decade is selected at one time and later supplemented with new construction. Direct use is made of decennial census address lists to create and sample about 75 percent of the USUs. This list is anywhere from 4 to 14 years old for a particular month of CPS interviewing. To the extent that PSUs are growing or declining in population at different rates, the non-self-representing PSUs weights (w psu ) that are based on census populations are inefficient. The ACS data can remove the inefficiencies of relying on census population numbers that are anywhere from 4 to 14 years old. The weights (w hu ) assigned to USUs within PSUs can also become inefficient, due mostly to the increasing number of housing units on the census lists that are demolished through the decade; an up-to-date address file from the ACS can greatly reduce the problem.         The use of ACS data can be beneficial in the first-stage (w 1st ) and second-stage (w 2nd ) ratio adjustments. The first-stage ratio adjustment is applied to persons for black/non-black in 20 selected states; it forces the weighted 16+ decennial census data from sampled non-self-representing PSUs to equal actual data for all non-self-representing PSUs in the state. To the extent that the demographic composition of the non-self representing PSUs is changing over the decade, this ratio based on the decennial census is inefficient. Having a more up-to-date ""count"" from ACS would improve this weight adjustment. The second-stage ratio adjustment is applied to persons within each of the eight rotation groups and is raked six times to independent population controls for 50 States and District of Columbia, and various national demographic groups. The derivation of independent population controls for various demographic groups is extremely difficult and complex, and is an inexact science. This process can be greatly enhanced and validated by the ACS data.    The ACS interviews can be used to target housing units containing demographic groups so that CPS can oversample these groups within the CPS sample PSUs to provide more precise estimates. The MAF could also be used to give greater flexibility to expand the CPS sample. For example, the possibility of a telephone only component across a state can substantially reduce between-PSU variance.    Before using the ACS and MAF for these purposes, however, many issues such as coverage, address quality, and timeliness need to be studied and evaluated. In particular, if there is a lag in picking up new construction on the MAF, it may be necessary to give higher weight to the most recent new construction in the basic CPS building permit frame to make up for the absence of these units in the supplemental MAF frame. The determination of ""frame status"" for this dual frame estimation problem could be done in several ways. The CPS permit sample might be matched against the new MAF address each time it is updated, or information about when the unit was first occupied could be collected on the CPS interview.    VI. Labor Force Questions and Data Collection Procedures—ACS vs. CPS    In the following subsections, we summarize some of the more important content and procedural differences between the CPS and the ACS.     Labor Force Questions.  On the CPS, there are at least 16 questionnaire items (see Table 1) that are used to assign the target person to one of seven labor force (LF) categories. On the ACS, while there are four numbered questions (items 22, 28, 29, and 30), there are actually seven labor force questions—item 28 has three parts and the response options to Q30 can be viewed as being equivalent to one of the CPS LF items (see Table 2). While it will  not  be possible to assign the target person to one of the seven CPS labor force categories using the seven LF questions on the ACS, it will be possible to assign persons to one of the three major LF categories (employed, unemployed, not in labor force). Given the different sets of questions asked (and ignoring for the time being other important considerations, like mode effects), at issue here is whether the two surveys are capable of producing equivalent estimates with respect to these three major LF categories. In our view, considering question content  alone , the two sets of LF questions (ACS vs. CPS) are capable of producing fairly similar estimates of major labor force categories. One key estimate, the unemployment rate, will  not  be equivalent—but the discrepancy may not be that large. In the CPS, most (but certainly not all) persons are classified as unemployed on the basis of answers provided to a sequence of four questions (LK, LKM1, LKAVL, and LKAVR). The ACS asks the equivalent of three of these questions. The only question not specifically asked in the ACS is LKM1. [Note: Field-testing would need to be conducted in order to determine actual CPS-versus-ACS differences for each major labor force category (employed, unemployed, not in labor force).]    Mode of Administration.  All CPS interviews are conducted by Census Bureau interviewers using computers; approximately one-quarter of these interviews are scheduled to be in person with the remainder being conducted over the telephone. Over 60 percent of the ACS cases will involve a self-administered interview. All of the remaining cases (40 percent) will involve computer-assisted interviews conducted by Census Bureau interviewers; approximately one-quarter of that 40 percent will be telephone interviews and the remainder will be personal visits. Given that interviewers will not be on hand to answer questions respondents might have when completing the ACS, one might presume that data quality for the self-administered ACS cases will be inferior to that collected by interviewers for both the ACS and the CPS. The following example illustrates a potential data-quality problem. During the quality assessment phase of the redesign of the CPS, interviewers consistently reported that some respondents were experiencing confusion on how to respond to CPS item WK: ""LAST WEEK, did you do ANY work for (either) pay (or profit)?"" A common response to this question was: ""Just my job."" Apparently this happens fairly frequently, but it is not a serious data quality issue for the CPS because interviewers know to code such answers as a ""yes"" response and move on. It is not known how respondents will deal with this confusion in the self-administered context of the ACS. Almost certainly, some percentage of respondents will answer ""no"" to Q22 (assuming that this question is asking about work  other than  that associated with their jobs) and, as a consequence, will be classified as either unemployed or not in labor force by the ACS. This is a potentially serious data-quality problem.    Reference Week.  The CPS has a fixed reference week (the week containing the 12 th  of the month), whereas the ACS has a floating reference week (the respondent reports for the calendar week preceding the date on which the survey, or interview, was completed). As noted in ACS documentation under  Limitation of the Data : ""The reference week for the employment data is not the same for all persons. Since persons can change their employment status from one week to another, the lack of a uniform reference week may mean that the employment data do not reflect the reality of the employment situation in any given week.""    Household Composition.  The CPS has a complex set of rules for determining who is to be included as a member of the household (see CPS interviewers manual, p. C3-7). These rules are not captured in the instructions provided to ACS respondents (see left-hand margin on p. 2 of the ACS form). Since the two surveys do not define household membership in equivalent ways, there will be differences in labor force estimates, and it is important to study and quantify them.    Other Issues.  There are a variety of other issues that potentially impact the comparability of labor force estimates generated by the ACS vis-à-vis the CPS, such as:         Unit nonresponse and imputation procedures differ for the two surveys.    Differences in data-collection phases affect the accuracy of reported data. For example, missing data from the self-administered phase of the ACS will be collected by phone approximately one month after questionnaires are returned, whereas CPS interviewers are trained to minimize missing data problems.    Processing paper-and-pencil data (ACS), relative to electronic processing (CPS), may impact data accuracy.    For the CPS, there is approximately a 75 percent overlap for CPS-interviewed households from one month to the next—that is, about 75 percent of the households have been interviewed in the previous month. The expected value of unemployment rate for months-in-sample one and five (incoming group) is higher than for the other six months. This is documented in the paper ""The Effects of Rotation Group Bias on Estimates from Panel Surveys,"" in Bailar (1975). There is no common sample component from month to month or from year to year in the ACS.

Methodologies to Reconcile ACS to CPS National Data    At present, it is not possible to produce national or any state level estimates from ACS, because the survey is being conducted only in 31 sites for comparison to Census 2000. However, once the ACS is implemented nationwide, there will be annual average estimates from both CPS and ACS both at the national and state level, for the three major labor force categories. Given that CPS is specifically designed to measure labor force status of individuals and is the internationally recognized standard for such measurements, the national labor force estimates from the ACS will be inferior to those produced from the CPS with respect to reliability and timeliness. The plans are to adjust the ACS annual average labor force estimates to agree with the CPS measures of employment and unemployment at the national level. This adjustment is being done at the national level because CPS estimates for even the largest State, California, have large sampling errors.     Several methods can be considered to calibrate ACS data to agree with CPS labor force estimates. Various  constrained estimation techniques,  such as ""calibration estimation"", can modify the ACS weights, so that the ACS weighted annual average equals selected labor force estimates. However, these weights may not be suitable for ACS characteristics other than labor force characteristics.  Prediction models,  using the CPS as the dependent variables and ACS as the independent variables, could produce ACS-based estimates which are generally in agreement with the CPS estimates, but again this only applies to the variables included in the model. A more flexible approach, allowing the calibrated variables to be cross-tabulated with the full range of ACS data, would be  imputation of ""adjusted"" responses  for sample individuals, based on measurement error models whose parameters are estimated from the differences between CPS and ACS. The idea is to estimate what proportion of the ACS respondents must have given the wrong answers to produce the observed differences, and then to impute the necessary proportion of different answers to bring agreement. (Chand and Alexander, 1997)              VIII. Improvements to State and sub-State Estimates    While the CPS sample is designed to achieve a high degree of reliability for monthly unemployment estimates for the Nation as a whole, for each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia this sample is too thinly spread geographically to support ""useful"" sample-based monthly estimates. Most states have monthly estimates that have standard errors of 1.0 percentage point. In other words, there is a 90 percent chance that the estimate of the unemployment rate will be as high as 7.6 percent or as low as 4.4 percent when the true rate is 6.0 percent. At present, statewide employment and unemployment estimates are produced using time series methodology developed by BLS staff. The model represents an observed state CPS series as the sum of ""signal plus noise"": CPS t  = Signal t  + Noise t    The signal represents the true value of the labor force characteristic, either unemployment or employment, which would be produced if a complete census of the population were taken. The noise represents mainly error due to sampling a portion of the population. Changes in CPS data represent both signal and noise. The state and four area models use two types of information to estimate the signal: 1) characteristics of the CPS error to estimate the noise; and 2) historical state CPS (employment and unemployment), UI claims, and payroll employment data to estimate a time series model of the signal. An important feature of the CPS design that the model accounts for is the positive autocorrelation structure induced by sample overlap from the 4-8-4 rotation. While the models remove noise from the monthly estimates on a current basis, some of the survey error is included back in the estimates during the annual benchmarking process that forces the annual average of the model estimates to equal to the CPS annual average. As mentioned earlier, for most states, a considerable amount of sampling error is associated even with annual average estimates from CPS.    The ACS data can be of help in developing alternative benchmarking methods. For example, we can compare and evaluate the annual average percentage changes in unemployment rates and employment-to-population ratios between the ACS, CPS, and model estimates across states and time to determine whether it is even necessary to benchmark on a priori basis. Perhaps, benchmarking should occur only when certain conditions are not met (i.e., model failure). Alternatively, data may indicate that it is sufficient to benchmark the sum of the state estimates from time series models to the CPS national estimates on a monthly basis. Another immediate use of the ACS data can be made in the diagnostic analysis of additive outliers, temporary level shifts that are generally induced by 4-8-4 sample rotation, and permanent level shifts. It would, however, take time to build up an ACS data time series for direct use in the state models.    With the exception of the New York City, the balance of New York, the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and the balance of California, the labor force estimates for the sub-state areas are produced using a building block approach. Monthly estimates are produced for over 6,000 areas—metropolitan and small labor market areas, counties, cities of 25,000 population or more, and cities and towns of all sizes in New England. This method uses very little direct information from the CPS because in many of these areas the sample sizes are too small or nonexistent. Data from a variety of sources are used and some input, particularly items utilized from the decennial census, can be out-of-date. It is in the area of sub-state level estimates that the data from ACS when combined with CPS has the greatest potential benefit. At these levels, ACS data are expected to have smaller variances than CPS and CPS to have smaller bias than ACS. Models that utilize both sets of data would, on average, yield smaller total error as measured by mean squared error (variance + bias 2 ). These models can be built at higher geographic levels (e.g., state, large metropolitan areas) that have sufficiently large CPS sample. Using these relationships, labor force estimates for smaller geographic entities can be produced that are, on average, more reliable than the ones produced using current methodology.     IX.   Summary    The data from the ACS will provide information similar to that currently being collected on the census long form on a continuous basis rather than once a decade. Additionally, it has the potential to vastly improve state and sub-state estimates that are currently produced from other household surveys. In particular, we feel this rich data source will greatly  complement but not replace  CPS data to improve labor force estimates at the state and sub-state levels. Before new procedures are adopted and implemented, however, we believe much research remains to be done in evaluating the ACS and in constructing and testing labor force models.    X.

This guidance, which has been developed with the involvement of many Federal agencies, essentially was requested by those agencies and the many users of data on race and ethnicity. The guidance focuses on three areas: collecting data using the new standards, tabulating data collected under the new standards, and building bridges to compare data collected under the new and the old standards. At this juncture, the guidance is often in the form of alternatives for discussion rather than recommendations for implementation. In many areas work is ongoing, and the guidance will be amended as additional research and analyses are completed. At this juncture, we are seeking broader comment on the guidance. In keeping with the process that guided review and revision of the standards for data on race and ethnicity, we are looking forward to an open dialogue on this draft provisional guidance. Following a two month period for discussion by stakeholders within and outside government, we expect to issue provisional guidance at the end of April. We expect the guidance issued at that time will evolve further as data from Census 2000 and other data collections employing the new collection standards become available. We look forward to your review and comments, and welcome your questions. Katherine K.

To foster comparability across data collections carried out by various agencies, it is useful for those agencies to report responses of more than one race using some standardized tabulations or formats. The report briefly explains why the tabulation guidelines are needed, reviews the general guidance issued when the new standards were adopted in October 1997, and provides information on the criteria used in developing the guidelines. This report also addresses a larger set of implementation questions that have emerged during the working group' deliberations. Thus, the s report considers: C C C C Collecting data on race and ethnicity using the new standards, including aggregate data reporting, Tabulating Census 2000 data and data on race and ethnicity collected in surveys and from administrative records, Using data on race and ethnicity in applications such as legislative redistricting and equal employment opportunity monitoring, and Comparing data under the old and the new standards when conducting analyses.  In addition, the appendices to the draft report contain the full text of the reports on the research that has been conducted in two areas: best procedural practices for implementing the new standards, and approaches for bridging between data collected under the old standards and data collected under the new standards. The guidelines are necessarily provisional pending the availability of data from Census 2000 and other data systems as the new standards are implemented. They are likely to be reviewed and refined as Federal agencies and others gain experience with data collected under the new 5    standards. In addition, in some portions of this report, guidelines have not yet been determined. Instead, options are presented and guidelines in these areas will be issued at a later date. OMB expects to issue this provisional guidance by the end of April 1999, following a period of public discussion of this draft by interested users. As noted in the Table of Contents and the report, a few sections are still ""under development""and will be available for review at a later time.  6    I.  BACKGROUND  This part of the report discusses why guidance is needed for tabulating data collected using the 1997 standards, reiterates the general guidance issued in October 1997, provides clarification of several aspects of the new standards, and presents the criteria that were developed for evaluating bridging methods and presenting data. A. The Need for Tabulation Guidelines and Alternative Approaches On October 30, 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published ""Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity"" (Federal Register, 62 FR 58781 - 58790), which are reprinted in Appendix A. The new standards reflect a change in data collection policy, making it possible for Federal agencies to collect information that reflects the increasing diversity of our Nation's population stemming from growth in interracial marriages and immigration. Under the new policy, agencies are now required to offer respondents the option of selecting one or more of the following five racial categories included in the updated standards: -American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used in addition to ""Black or African American."" Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.  --  --  ---  These five categories are the minimum set for data on race for Federal statistics, program administrative reporting, and civil rights compliance reporting. With respect to ethnicity, the standards provide for the collection of data on whether or not a person is of ""Hispanic or Latino"" culture or origin. (The standards do not permit a multiple response that would indicate an ethnic heritage that is both Hispanic or Latino and non-Hispanic or Latino.) This category is defined as follows: 7    --  Hispanic or Latino. A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, ""Spanish origin,"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic or Latino.""  As a result of the change in policy for collecting data on race, the reporting categories used to present these data must similarly reflect this change. In keeping with the spirit of the new standards, agencies cannot collect multiple responses and then report and publish data using only the five single race categories. Agencies are expected to provide as much detail as possible on the multiple race responses, consistent with agency confidentiality and data quality procedures. As provided by the standards, OMB will consider any agency variances to this policy on a case by case basis. Based on research to date, it is estimated that less than two percent of the Nation's total population is likely to identify with more than one race. This percentage may increase as those who identify with more than one racial heritage become aware of the opportunity to report more than one race. In the early years of the standards'implementation, there will be issues of data quality and confidentiality related to sample size that may restrict the amount of data that can be published for some combinations of multiple race responses. Over time, however, the size of these data cells may increase. It should be noted that such data quality and confidentiality problems for small population groups also existed under the old standards, where sample sizes prevented presentation of data on certain population groups such as American Indians. The possible multiple race combinations under the new standards, some with small data cells, serve to make such data quality concerns more apparent. Some balance will need to be struck between having a tabulation showing the full distribution of all possible combinations of multiple race responses and presenting only the minimum -- that is, a single aggregate of people who reported more than one race. B. General Guidelines for Tabulating Data on Race In response to concerns that had been raised about how Federal agencies would tabulate multiple race responses, OMB in the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice issued the following general guidance: C Consistent with criteria for confidentiality and data quality, the tabulation procedures used by the agencies should result in the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as possible. Guidelines for tabulation ultimately must meet the needs of at least two groups within the Federal Government, with the overriding objective of providing the most accurate and informative body of data. (1) The first group is composed of those Federal Government officials charged with carrying out constitutional and legislative mandates, such as redistricting 8   C   legislatures, enforcing civil rights laws, and monitoring progress in anti discrimination programs. (The legislative redistricting file produced by the Bureau of the Census, also known as the Public Law 94-171 file, is an example of a file meeting such legislative needs.) (2) C The second group consists of the staff of Federal statistical agencies producing and analyzing data that are used to monitor economic and social conditions and trends. provides, racial and the add to the  Many of the needs of the first group can be met with an initial tabulation that consistent with standards for data quality and confidentiality, the full detail of reporting; that is, the number of people reporting in each single race category number reporting in each of the possible combinations of races, which would total population.  C  Depending on the judgment of users, the combinations of multiple responses could be collapsed. (1) One method would be to provide separate totals for those reporting in the most common multiple race combinations and to collapse the data for other less frequently reported combinations. The specifics of the collapsed distributions would be dependent on the results of particular data collections. A second method would be to report the total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination with other races. These totals would represent upper bounds on the size of the populations who identified with each of the racial categories. In some cases, this latter method could be used for comparing data collected under the old standards with data collected under the new standards.  (2)  C C  It is important that Federal agencies with the same or closely related responsibilities adopt the same tabulation method. Regardless of the method chosen for collapsing multiple race responses, Federal agencies must make available the total number reporting more than one race, if confidentiality and data quality requirements can be met, in order to ensure that any changes in response patterns resulting from the new standards can be monitored over time. Different tabulation procedures might be required to meet various needs of Federal agencies for data on race. Nevertheless, Federal agencies often need to compare racial and ethnic data. Hence, some standardization of tabulation categories for reporting data on race is desirable to facilitate such comparisons.  C  The October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice identified four areas where further research was needed in how to tabulate data under the new standards: 9    (1) (2)  How should the data be used to evaluate conformance with program objectives in the area of equal employment opportunity and other anti-discrimination programs? How should the decennial census data for many small population groups with multiple racial heritages be used to develop sample designs and survey controls for major demographic surveys? How do we introduce the use of the new standards in the vital statistics program which obtains the number of births or deaths from administrative records, but uses intercensal population estimates in determining the rates of births and deaths? And more generally, how can we conduct meaningful comparisons of data collected under the previous standards with those that will be collected under the new standards?  (3)  (4)  In order to address these and other issues and to ensure that tabulation methodologies would be carefully developed and coordinated among the Federal agencies, OMB assembled a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from the Federal agencies that generate or use these data. Over the past year, this group has considered tabulation issues and developed the draft provisional guidance that is presented in this report for use by Federal agencies. The work of this group has included: (1) a review of Federal data needs and uses to ensure that the tabulation guidelines produce data that meet statutory and program requirements; (2) cognitive testing of the wording of questions; (3) development of a form for reporting aggregate data; (4) evaluation of different methods of bridging from the new to the old standards; and (5) development of guidelines for presenting data on multiple race responses that meet accepted data quality and confidentiality standards. The tabulation 2000 data and guidelines will data collected guidance in this report is necessarily provisional pending the availability of Census other data systems as the new collection standards are implemented. These be reviewed and modified as the agencies and other data users gain experience with using the new standards.  C. Points of Clarification Regarding the 1997 Standards A few questions about the new standards have emerged over the past year. This section elaborates on several points in the standards that have been a source of confusion for some users. Under the new standards, ""Hispanic or Latino"" is clearly designated as an ethnicity and not as a race. Whether or not an individual is Hispanic, every effort should be made to ascertain the race or races with which an individual identifies. The two-question format, with the ethnicity question preceding the race question, should be used when information is collected through self-identification. Although the standards permit the use 10    of a combined question when collecting data by observer identification, the use of the twoquestion format is strongly encouraged even where observer identification is used . Regardless of the question format, observers are expected to attempt to identify the individual' s race(s). The standards require that at a minimum the total number of persons identifying with more than one race be reported. It is stressed that this is a minimum; agencies are strongly encouraged to report detailed information on specific racial combinations subject to constraints of data reliability and confidentiality standards. The following wording concerning the reporting of data when the combined question is used is clarified in the paragraph below: ""In cases where data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting ` Hispanic or Latino and one or more races'and the total number of respondents reporting ` more than one race'(regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided."" (Section 2b of the standards) Race by ethnicity always should be reported when confidentiality permits. If not, the first level of collapsing should be ethnicity by the single races and ethnicity for those reporting more than one race. Thus, an Hispanic or Latino respondent reporting one race should be reported both as Hispanic or Latino and as a member of that single race. If the respondent selects more than one race, he or she should be reported in the particular racial combination as well as in the Hispanic or Latino category. Reporting a composite -- that is, the number of people who responded ""Hispanic or Latino"" and more than one race -- is a minimum that only should be used if more detailed reporting would violate data reliability and confidentiality standards. The rules discussed in Section 4 of the new standards concerning the presentation of data on race and ethnicity under special circumstances are not to be invoked unilaterally by an agency. If the agency believes the standard categories are inappropriate, the agency must request a specific variance from OMB. The new standards do not include an ""other race"" category. For the sole purpose of the Census 2000 data collection, OMB has granted an exception to the Census Bureau to use a category called ""Some Other Race."" D. Criteria Used in Developing the Tabulation Guidelines The interagency expert group on tabulations generated criteria that could be used both to evaluate the technical merits of different bridging procedures (See Part V and Appendix D) and to display data under the new standards. The relative importance of each criterion will depend on the purpose for which the data are intended to be used. For example, in the case of bridging to the past, the most important criterion is ""measuring change over time,"" while ""congruence with 11    respect to respondent' choice"" will be more critical for presenting data under the new standards. s The criteria set forth below are designed only to assess the technical adequacy of the various statistical procedures. The first two criteria listed below are central to consideration of bridging methods. The next six criteria apply both to bridging and long-term tabulation decisions. The last criterion is of primary importance for future tabulations of data collected under the new standards. Bridging: Measure change over time. This is the most important criterion for bridging, because the major purpose of any historical bridge will be to measure true change over time as distinct from methodologically induced change. The ideal bridging method, under this criterion, would be one that matches how the respondent would have responded under the old standards had that been possible. In this ideal situation, differences between the new distribution and the old distribution would reflect true change in the distribution itself. Minimize disruptions to the single race distribution. This criterion applies only to methods for bridging. Its purpose is to consider how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the new standards. To the extent that a bridging method can meet the other criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportion in the ongoing distribution, it will facilitate looking both forward and backward in time. Bridging and future tabulations: Range of applicability. Because the purpose of the guidelines is to foster consistency across agencies in tabulating racial and ethnic data, tabulation procedures that can be used in a wide range of programs and varied contexts are usually preferable to those that have more limited applicability. Meet confidentiality and reliability standards. It is essential that the tabulations maintain the confidentiality standards of the statistical organization while producing reliable estimates. Statistically defensible. Because tabulations may be published by statistical agencies and/or provided in public use data, the recommended tabulation procedures should follow recognized statistical practices. Ease of use. Because the tabulation procedures are likely to be used in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they can be implemented with a minimum of operational difficulty. Thus, the tabulation procedures must be capable of being easily replicated by others.  12    Skill required. Similarly, it is important that the tabulation procedures can be implemented by individuals with relatively little statistical knowledge. Understandability and communicability. Again, because the tabulation procedures will likely be used, as well as presented, in a wide variety of situations by many different people, it is important that they be easily explainable to the public. Future tabulations: Congruence with respondent' choice. Because of changes in the categories and the s respondent instructions accompanying the question on race (allowing more than one category to be selected), the underlying logic of the tabulation procedures must reflect to the greatest extent possible the full detail of race reporting.  13    II.  COLLECTING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY USING THE NEW STANDARDS  This part of the report currently provides a summary of the Phase I Report on Procedural Implementation of the New Standards for Data on Race and Ethnicity, which is contained in Appendix B. A. Developing Procedures for Data Collection An interagency committee has been continuing past research efforts to develop procedures to collect and aggregate data on race and ethnicity. This research is designed to produce guidelines that address three areas: (1) wording and format of questions that ask for self-reported data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin; (2) wording and format of instructions and forms that collect aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin; and (3) instructions and training procedures for field interviewers and administrative personnel who will be using these questions and forms. Guidelines will be continually reviewed and modified as implementation of the new standards occurs, feedback from agencies is received, and new research findings become available. Members of the procedures committee represent the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, and the General Accounting Office. This summary briefly describes the Phase I research, offers initial guidelines for agencies developing new data collection procedures, and includes a schedule for the completion of work by this committee. The full report of the committee includes the research design and methods, results of Phase I, examples of test questions and forms, and a broader discussion of guidelines and problems identified. Developing and Testing Self-Reported Race and Ethnicity Questions A goal of this research is to provide guidance on the wording and format of questions for self reporting race and Hispanic or Latino origin depending on the mode of administration. Questions administered by telephone or in a face-to-face personal interview have been tested in cognitive laboratory interviews; self-administered questions are not included in this testing because the Census Bureau previously conducted such research in preparation for Census 2000. To date, 32 cognitive interviews have been completed; another 18 are planned for Phase I and at least 25 more for Phase II. Among the 32 subjects interviewed, 13 reported their race as Black, 3 reported Asian, 2 reported Native Hawaiian, 4 reported more than one race, and 10 reported White, of which 2 also reported Hispanic or Latino origin. No American Indians or Alaska Natives have been interviewed yet in Phase I. Subjects were first asked routine demographic questions as well as the test Hispanic or Latino origin and race questions for themselves and members of their household. Then, debriefings were conducted to learn more about the subjects'understanding of the questions and terms used. 14    Generally, subjects were able to answer without difficulty the race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared but individual differences in the interpretation and meaning of terms used was found, as was confusion regarding the separation of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. As expected, subjects who were interviewed face-to-face seemed to use and rely on the flashcards to select a response. Subjects interviewed by telephone had a bit more difficulty answering the race questions since they had to listen to a relatively long list of response options. Also, there was some evidence that the instruction to ""...select one or more..."" was misunderstood on the telephone to mean that the subject had to select more than one race. Section 1 in Appendix B describes in detail the results of testing the questions on race and ethnicity. Based on these interviews, the following initial guidelines for the design of questions on race and ethnicity are offered: C C C Communicate clearly an instruction that allows, but does not require, multiple responses to the race question. Consider using an instruction to answer both the Hispanic or Latino origin question and the race question. For data collection efforts requiring detailed Hispanic or Latino origin or detailed race information, consider options to collect further information through write-in entries or follow-up questions asked by the interviewer. Take mode of administration carefully into account when designing questions and instructions. Provide definitions to the minimum race categories when possible. Adhere to the specific terminology as stated in the October 30, 1997, standards.  C C C  Developing and Testing Aggregate Reporting Forms Implementing the revised standards will cause fundamental changes to the ways in which data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin have previously been aggregated and reported. Therefore, a second goal of this research is to provide guidance on the design of reporting forms that will be used by administrative personnel to aggregate data on race and Hispanic or Latino origin for a given population (e.g., reporting race and ethnicity for a school population). Twenty cognitive interviews are planned for this phase of the research. Three different forms are being tested with subjects who are familiar with reporting aggregate data for a given population, 15    but not necessarily familiar with the revised standards. Fourteen interviews have been completed thus far, 7 in cognitive laboratories and 7 on-site. Of the 14 respondents interviewed, 5 worked for the Federal Government, 6 worked in private industry, 2 worked in local correctional facilities, and 1 worked in a school. For the laboratory testing, subjects were given ` dummy'records of applications that contained multiple race responses as well as combined Hispanic or Latino origin and race questions. For the on-site interviews, subjects referred to agency data. None of the forms tested were completed accurately without interviewer intervention. Regardless of the form tested or whether the testing was conducted in a laboratory or on-site, the most common problem was the requirement to count and report race for individuals who are of Hispanic or Latino origin. As an illustration, one subject stated ""It' (the form) basically asking s how Hispanics were separated into groups of races. I think the part that confuses me is that our Hispanics do not view themselves as another race. And so that is kind of what threw me off... it' asking for Hispanics who had marked ` s White,'but they don' They would have checked t. Hispanic."" Discussions with subjects revealed that all but one worked for agencies that have used the single question -- combined race and ethnicity format -- to collect data. Several methodological problems also emerged and will be corrected prior to further testing. They are discussed in detail in Appendix B, Section 2. Even though there were many problems found in developing and testing aggregate forms, some initial guidelines can be put forth at this time. C C C C If possible, allow for the reporting of every combination of multiple race responses. Provide definitions that assist in understanding the concepts of single race reports and multiple race reports as well as the distinction between ethnicity and race. Explain how the missing data should be reported. Professionally design the form and include clear instructions.  Development of Field Instructions and Training Procedures Work to develop interviewer instructions and interviewer training procedures will begin in the Spring of 1999. Plans include developing and testing different training modules and interviewer instructions, depending on the mode of administration and the type of data collection. This work will, in all likelihood, not address new issues or problems. However, since the new standards do encompass several distinct changes, it seems timely to address in a more systematic way some longstanding issues in the fielding of the questions, and ways that interviewers can be trained to improve data quality. Specific procedures on how to ask the questions and, in some cases, how to instruct the respondent to use the flashcard, will be developed along with suggested interviewer 16    probes, definitions, and statements that can be used to answer respondent questions. Schedule Phase I was ongoing through 1998 and will be completed at the beginning of April 1999. Phase II will begin in April 1999 and will be completed by the end of July 1999. A final report encompassing both phases should be available by the end of September 1999.  17    B. Best Practices in Survey Design and Data Processing (Under development)  18    III.  TABULATING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY COLLECTED USING THE NEW STANDARDS  This part of the report describes options for tabulating data on race and ethnicity collected under the new standards to meet various Federal needs for these data. A. Decennial Census The Census 2000 questionnaire will provide individuals the opportunity to self-report their racial identity by selecting one or more races. For purposes of Census 2000 only, in an effort to encourage response to this question, OMB has approved the use of a sixth category -- ""Some Other Race"" -- in addition to the minimum five categories. This discussion covers preliminary tabulations plans for the six categories of race and the two categories of ethnicity (""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino"") and for possible combinations of these racial and ethnic categories. It does not address tabulation plans for detailed groups of American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander populations for which information will be collected in Census 2000. For data from the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal sites, table shells will be available on the Internet through the Census Bureau' American FactFinder. The data user will be able to use the inquiry s system in the American FactFinder to obtain table shells filled with data for user-selected geographic areas and for population universes defined by race and ethnicity down to the census tract level. The amount of data on population characteristics available in table shells will be roughly the same as in printed reports in 1990 for counties and for places of 10,000 or more population. Protection of Confidentiality in Data from Census 2000 To maintain confidentiality as required by law (Title 13, United States Code), the Census Bureau uses a confidentiality edit to ensure that published data do not disclose information about specific individuals, households, and housing units. The result is that a small amount of uncertainty is introduced into some of the census data to prevent identification of specific individuals, households, or households. As with data from the 1990 census, a confidentiality edit will be implemented for data from Census 2000 by selecting a sample of census households from internal census files and interchanging their data with data from other households that have identical numbers of household members, but that are in different locations within the same state. The net result of this procedure is that the data user' ability to obtain census data is increased, particularly for small geographic s areas and small population groups.  19    Approach for Tabulations by Race and Ethnicity for Census 2000 The proposed approach reflects OMB' preliminary guidelines (See Part I, Section B) on s tabulations by race and ethnicity. The discussion of the approach includes data on both population totals for racial and ethnic categories and on population characteristics (e.g., age and sex) for racial and ethnic categories. Before describing preliminary plans for tabulations by race and ethnicity, it is helpful to describe both the maximum number of racial and/or ethnic categories for which data could be provided and some of the other racial and/or ethnic categories for which data could be provided. There are 63 potential single and multiple race categories, including 6 categories for those who marked exactly one race and 57 categories for those who marked two or more races. These 57 categories of two or more races include the 15 possible combinations of two races (for example, Asian and White), the 20 possible combinations of three races, the 15 possible combinations of four races, the 6 possible combinations of five races, and the 1 possible combination of all six races. There are two ethnic categories (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Thus there are 126 categories (63 x 2) in which the population could be classified by both race and ethnicity. The 63 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories of race may be collapsed down to 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories by combining the 57 categories of two or more races. These 7 categories are: White alone, Black or African American alone, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Asian alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, Some other race alone, and Two or more races. Alternative groupings for tabulations by race reflect OMB' preliminary guidelines to show ""the s total selecting each particular race, whether alone or in combination."" In combination literally means ""in combination with one or more other races."" In this ""all-inclusive"" approach, tabulations would be shown for each of six categories, which will overlap and will add to more than the total population to the extent that individuals report more than one race. These six categories are: White alone or in combination, Black or African American alone or in combination, American Indian and Alaska Native alone or in combination, Asian alone or in combination, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone or in combination, and Some Other Race alone or in combination. As in the case of the 63 racial categories, both tabulations by race of the 7 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories and tabulations by race alone or in combination could be classified by ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). Because of concerns about the usefulness and reliability of data on population characteristics for small populations, about issues with respect to confidentiality, and about providing data products 20    so voluminous that most data cell values would be zero, the Census Bureau is planning (as it has in previous censuses) to present more detail by race and ethnicity for population totals than for population characteristics. For example, Census 2000 data products might show a population total for a specific racial or ethnic group (e.g., 50) in a small geographic area, but not show data on characteristics such as household relationship, education, income, and tenure for this racial or ethnic group. Preliminary plans for tabulations by race and ethnicity for population totals and for population characteristics are discussed in the following two sections. The amount of detail shown in tabulations by race and ethnicity in data products from Census 2000 will vary with the purpose and size of each product. Planned tabulations for population totals by race and ethnicity from four data products are discussed: the Public Law 94-171 file (which is a 100-percent data product), the 100-percent demographic profile, the 100-percent summary file, and 100-percent table shells. Planned tabulations for population characteristics by race and ethnicity are discussed together for the 100-percent and sample summary files and the 100-percent and sample table shells. (The 100-percent data products are based on data collected on all questionnaires. In comparison, sample data products are based on data collected only on long-form questionnaires.) As noted above, this discussion does not discuss tabulation plans for detailed groups of American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander populations. It may be noted, however, that tabulations for these detailed categories will not be included on the PL 94-171 file, but will be included in the other Census 2000 data products listed in the preceding paragraph. Population Totals: Preliminary Plans for Data by Race and Ethnicity from Census 2000 Public Law (PL) 94-171 Redistricting File. PL 94-171 requires that the Census Bureau work closely with the ""officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting of each state"" to determine the specific tabulations needed from the decennial census. Tabulations planned for this file are based on meetings and communications with the Redistricting Task Force of the National Conference of State Legislatures and state appointed liaisons of the governors and legislatures. During this process, senior officials from OMB, the Voting Rights Section of the Department of Justice, and the Census Bureau consulted with the Task Force and state legislative officials. The PL 94-171 file will include population totals down to the block level. The racial and ethnic categories that the Census Bureau plans to include in the matrices (one-dimensional statistical tables) on the PL 94-171 file are combined into one table outline and presented in Table 1. (The PL 94-171 file also includes data on the population 18 years and over for each of these racial or ethnic categories.) From tabulations for the racial and ethnic categories shown in Table 1, it is possible also to obtain tabulations by subtraction for the Hispanic or Latino population by race (total minus Not Hispanic 21    or Latino) and for the population in a racial category in combination only (e.g., Asian alone or in combination minus Asian alone). The PL 94-171 file will be available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. A paper listing of data from the PL 94-171 file, to be provided to officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting of each state, will include about one-half of the tabulations shown above. The paper listing will not include tabulations for Race alone or in combination, or for Race not alone or in combination. 100-Percent Demographic Profile. This profile is designed to provide for geographic areas down to the census tract level an overview of 100-percent census data on a one-page table that includes data on all population and housing topics for which data are collected on a 100-percent basis: sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household relationship, and housing occupancy and tenure. Given the limited amount of space to show data on each topic, population totals by race and ethnicity will be limited. Population totals will be shown for each of the major races alone, for two or more races, and for each major race alone or in combination (as described earlier), but will not be shown for the 57 specific categories of two or more races. 100-Percent Summary File. This file, which is the most detailed 100-percent data product planned, will include some population totals on race and ethnicity down to the block level and additional population totals on race and ethnicity down only to the census tract level. The racial and ethnic categories that the Census Bureau plans to include down to the block level in the matrices on the 100-percent summary file are combined into one table outline and presented in Table 2. The additional categories that are included down only to the census tract level in the 100-percent summary file are the 57 individual categories of two or more races crossed by the two ethnic categories (Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino). These racial and ethnic categories are combined into one table outline and presented in Table 3. 100-Percent Table Shells. Table shells represent a new data product for Census 2000. A table shell is a one-page table outline with a fixed stub and boxhead (for example, showing population by age and sex). Table shells are supported by summary files in the same way that data in various printed reports in 1990 were supported by summary tape files (STFs). Population Characteristics: Preliminary Plans for Data by Race and Ethnicity from Census 2000 100-Percent and Sample Summary Files and Table Shells. Plans for tabulations of population characteristics by race and ethnicity from the 100-percent and sample summary tables and from the 100-percent and sample table shells are discussed together here because the Census Bureau plans to show population characteristics for the same list of racial and ethnic groups in all of these data products. 22    In the case of summary files, population characteristics in the matrices on the files would be iterated (repeated) for each racial or ethnic category. This corresponds to the ""B"" matrices in summary tape files (STFs) 2 and 4 in 1990 census data products in which the ""B"" matrices were iterated for each of a list of racial and ethnic categories. In the case of table shells, population characteristics would be available for each of the racial and ethnic categories for which population characteristics are available on the summary files. The user of table shells will be able to select from a list of topics (e.g., age and sex) and then select the geographic area (e.g., state, county, place) and population universe (i.e., the racial or ethnic category) to obtain the data desired. The scope of data available using table shells is limited to data on summary files (in the same way that data in printed reports in 1990 were limited to data on summary files). Table shells will present subsets of more detailed data from the summary files in user-friendly formats (like tables in printed reports), and will show totals, subtotals, and derived measures that are not included on the summary files. The list of 27 racial and ethnic categories for which the Census Bureau plans to show population characteristics in aggregated data products (as opposed to what is available from microdata files, as discussed below) in Census 2000 is presented in Table 4. From tabulations for the list of racial and ethnic categories shown in Table 4, it is possible also to obtain tabulations by subtraction for the Hispanic or Latino population by race (total minus Not Hispanic or Latino), for the population in a racial category in combination only (e.g., Asian alone or in combination minus Asian alone), and for the complement to an all-inclusive group (e.g., total minus Asian alone or in combination). Micro data files. Tabulations on population characteristics by race and ethnicity described above are limited to what is planned for aggregated data products. In addition, the Census Bureau will produce 5-percent public-use microdata files (PUMS), as was done in 1990, which will permit users to obtain tabulations for any racial or ethnic group for which data were collected in the census. (This would include, for example, any of the 57 categories of more than one race.) In 1990, in addition to the confidentiality edit described earlier, the PUMS files were stripped of names and address, the order of records was rearranged on the file, and a minimum population threshold of 100,000 was used. In addition, and subject to the Census Bureau' strict confidentiality standards, the Census Bureau s plans to make available on the Internet through the American FactFinder, the microdata files that underlie the 100-percent and sample summary files for Census 2000 so that data users can create tabulations to their own specifications. These microdata files are the 100-percent edited detail file (HEDF) and the sample edited detail file (SEDF). The full microdata files will be made available to data users only in the form of PUMS files, as described above. If a data user wants data on population characteristics for a racial or ethnic group for which characteristics are not available in the summary files or table shells and for a geographic area for which a PUMS file is not available, it will be possible -- again, subject to strict confidentiality standards set by the Census Bureau -- to obtain these data in the American FactFinder with a 23    custom tabulation from the HEDF or the SEDF. For example, the data user will be able to obtain population characteristics for one of the 57 categories of more than one race (e.g., White and Asian). Because of the strict confidentiality standards, the quantity of data that can be obtained will depend on several factors, including the geographic area, the size of the population universe (e.g., the number of individuals who are Asian and White), and the extent of the characteristics detail (number of data cells in a table showing population characteristics).  24    Table 1.

Other Surveys and Administrative Records This section applies to the presentation of data collected under the new standards through surveys and administrative records. Although these proposed tabulation guidelines are particularly applicable in the near term, they also provide a framework that can be expanded in the future as it becomes possible to present more data on multiple race responses. In general, data should be presented in as much detail as possible (thereby satisfying the criteria congruence with respondent' choice), subject to satisfying agency criteria for statistical reliability and s confidentiality (satisfying the criteria meet confidentiality and reliability standards.) Thus, data on multiple race responses should be presented in as much detail as possible given sample sizes and sample designs. In addition, to the extent possible, Federal agencies should report data using standardized categories to facilitate comparisons across subject-matter areas and data systems, thus satisfying the criteria range of applicability, statistical defensibility, and understandability and communicability. The decision to revise the policy for the collection of data on race reflects the increasing complexity of our Nation' demographics. As a result, the ways that data on race are tabulated s and analyzed also will become more complex. The proposed guidelines in this section reflect this complexity. The tabulation strategies illustrated here have simple structures, hence they satisfy the criteria ease of use and skill required. Examples of tabulation strategies are provided and illustrated using data collected as part of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to report more than one race, but has also asked respondents to indicate the single race with which they most closely identified. The data on race from this survey have been retabulated for illustrative purposes to be as comparable as possible to the categories in the 1997 standards. (Unless otherwise noted, the tables in this section are based on data combined from three years of NHIS data. The resulting larger sample size improves the reliability of the estimates and enables more categories to be shown. However, even when combining three years of data on race, counts for some categories cannot be shown due to small sample sizes.) As noted above, agencies are to provide as much detail as possible while adhering to their own standards for data quality and confidentiality. Under a typical data quality standard, a table cell cannot be published if its relative standard error (or other measure of dispersion) is larger than some value specified by the agency. In such a situation, the data cell is not published separately, but the cell value is included in subtotals. Under a confidentiality standard, a cell value must be suppressed (withheld from publication) if knowledge of the cell value might enable someone to gain knowledge about one of the respondents contributing data to the cell. If a cell is suppressed to preserve confidentiality, other cells must also be suppressed so the cell value cannot be derived by subtraction. This is called ""complementary suppression."" (The reader may wish to refer to Statistical Policy Working Paper 22: Report on Statistical Disclosure Limitation Methodology for more information concerning 29    the definition of sensitive cells and the selection of cells for complementary suppression.) Agencies do not use a common set of standards for evaluating confidentiality and quality issues. To illustrate the application of agency standards that affect the cells that can be shown in tables only a data quality standard is used here. A table cell has been arbitrarily classified as failing the data quality standard if the sample size is smaller than 0.2 percent of the population for all but Table C. To illustrate a table that might result from a smaller sample survey, in Table C a table cell is classified as failing the data quality standard if the sample size is smaller than 2.0 percent of the population. These admittedly arbitrary criteria are used to illustrate what might be published from a large sample survey, and to illustrate the distributions that may result from the implementation of the new standards. Note that since the only data being displayed in this report are population counts, it is possible to show more data cells than would be the case if the table presented attributes (income, education, health outcomes, etc.) of these groups. Individual survey systems will make decisions as to what data can be shown based on the characteristics of each system and the confidentiality and reliability guidelines established for that data system. Two types of responses cannot be tabulated into the categories identified in the standard. The first is when no information on race was provided. In this report the heading ""Race Not Reported"" is used for this type of response. This response type can be further subdivided according to the reason that no information was obtained -- refusal, don' know, and not t ascertained. The second is when a response was received that does not match any of the standard racial categories. Such responses are tabulated using the heading ""Other Race."" A third heading, ""Not Tabulated Above"" is used to include either single or more than one race categories that are specified in the standard, but are not large enough to be published separately. For illustrative purposes, these three headings are used in the tables in this section. Not all statistical publications will use this model. Strategies for tabulating these kinds of responses will follow agency policy and the analytic objectives of the report. A remaining issue to be addressed by Federal agencies is that the rules used in editing and imputing respondents'data on race and ethnicity will affect the racial distributions derived from Federal surveys and administrative records. As noted elsewhere in this report, rules for editing and imputation of data on race and ethnicity should be an area of further research and collaboration for Federal agencies, to ensure that the data reported are as comparable as possible. Since the objective of this section is to illustrate different tabulation strategies, categories with frequencies too small to be shown will not be treated the same way in all of the tables. In some tables, the category is not shown at all and the cell value is included under ""Not Tabulated Above""; in other tables, the category is retained in order to clarify the structure of the table but data are replaced by a ""Q"" to illustrate that they have been withheld from publication for data quality considerations. When the data are replaced by ""Q,"" a footnote is used to describe the reason the data are not shown.  30    In all tables in this section, the ""More Than One Race"" heading includes respondents who selected more than one of the five basic racial categories in the new standard. Many data collection systems obtain information on a more detailed set of responses. When surveys collect more detailed information on race than the minimum standard, some persons may indicate that they identify with more than one of the more detailed groups. For example, within the Asian group, respondents might indicate that they are of Chinese and Japanese heritage. These respondents would not be included in the ""More Than One Race"" heading but would be included in the total for Asians. If sample size permits, an additional Asian sub-category could be used to indicate the number of individuals who marked more than one of the detailed Asian categories. Table A illustrates the fundamental goal of the new standard and provides a detailed set of categories for tabulating data on race. Table A displays the five single categories, and also includes more detail on the Asian subgroups; it also displays a number of multiple-response categories. Based on NHIS data, the most frequently marked race combinations are American Indian and White, Asian and White, and Black and White. In other situations, the categories used to present data would be a function of the overall sample size and the regional characteristics of the population where the sample is selected. Whatever detailed categories are presented, they should support recreating the minimum basic set of racial categories. Table B shows a category for each of the five single racial groups in the new standards as well as a ""More Than One Race"" heading. It is an example of a table that can be used when sample sizes do not permit the presentation of greater detail. In this table, data are not shown separately for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, one of the single race categories in the collection standard, since they comprise less than 0.2 percent of the U.S. population. However, since this is the only category that cannot be shown both the number and the percent for the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander group are readily obtained by subtraction. This is an example of a data cell that is being suppressed for data quality concerns. If it were suppressed for confidentiality concerns, another cell would also have to be suppressed to prevent the cell value from being obtained by subtraction. As was the case under the 1977 standard, it will often not be possible to tabulate data using all of the categories used to collect the information. Even with three years of data from the NHIS, Tables A and B could not present data for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders because they total less than 0.2 percent of the population. If data for one or more of the five minimum racial categories fail the requirements for data quality or confidentiality, standard agency products should include them in an aggregation such as ""Not Tabulated Above,"" rather than combining them with categories that are publishable alone. For example, if the data for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders cannot be published separately, these data should not be combined with data in the Asian category (except when such combinations are needed for comparability with data collected under the old standard). Instead, the data on Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders should be included in the total and either omitted from the detailed tabulations completely, replaced with a symbol and footnoted as in Tables A and B, or included in a separate heading for all groups not specifically tabulated (i.e., under the Not Tabulated Above heading.) 31    This last approach is illustrated in Table C. For this table, only one year' NHIS data are used, s and data are reported only for categories that comprise at least 2 percent of the population. This is intended to provide an illustration of what might happen when total sample sizes are smaller and data from fewer categories can be reliably presented. Because the Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, More Than One Race, and Race Not Reported respondents each comprise less than 2 percent of the population, these categories were not listed separately in Table C but were included both in the Total and the Not Tabulated Above rows. In order to display as much data as possible as well as to reflect the complexity of reporting on race, some additional categories may be tabulated and reported along with the basic tabulations. These categories may not be mutually exclusive but would combine categories to create useful analytic distinctions. For example, a heading could be created for persons reporting that they are Asian whether as a single race or in combination with any other race(s). Parallel categories could be created for any of the five single racial categories. The resulting counts are called ""all inclusive."" They form distributions for each individual racial group; that is, the sum of the percent of respondents who mark a particular group alone, the percent who mark that group and at least one other group, and the percent who did not mark that group is 100 percent. The all inclusive distributions may provide information on population groups that might not have sufficient size in the sample to be included in basic tabulations. Table D provides a suggested tabulation strategy. Three years of NHIS data are used for this Table, and the 0.2 percent cutoff is used to determine whether data can be shown. The all inclusive NHOPI category does not meet the criteria for inclusion (0.2 percent of the population) and is not shown. Note that when the tabulation involves counts or percentages, the analyst can subtract the count or percentage for each single race from the all inclusive count or percentage to obtain the count of individuals reporting each race in combination with any other race(s). For example, the Black or African American all inclusive count minus the Black or African American single race count will yield a count for those reporting Black or African American in combination with one or more other races. This would not be possible if the tabulation included summary statistics (mean, median, or percent) for attributes such as income, education or health outcomes. Tables A - D describe tabulation alternatives for data on race collected using the new standards. The new standards also affect the collection and reporting of data on Hispanic or Latino origin. The new standards call for asking a question on Hispanic or Latino origin followed by a question on race but also allows under limited circumstances for a single, combined question where Hispanic or Latino origin is included in a list along with the five standard racial categories. In the combined question, respondents are also instructed to ""mark one or more."" In either case, Hispanic origin may be reported alone or in combination with one or more races. As was the case for the tabulation of data on race, data on Hispanic or Latino ethnicity can also be presented for specific subgroups (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican) as shown in Table E. The tabulation headings used will be a function of the overall sample size and the population composition where the sample is selected.  32    Even when separate questions are used to collect data on Hispanic or Latino origin and race, there are applications where a cross tabulation of the data from these two survey questions is preferred. Whether data are collected using the single question or the two question format, education and health data are frequently reported with racial data for Hispanics or Latinos as a separate group along with racial data for non-Hispanics or non-Latinos. Data collected under the new standards using either format will support the analysis of data on both Hispanics or Latinos and non-Hispanics or non-Latinos by race (Table F). For example, Table F shows that among Hispanics or Latinos, the sample size permits the presentation of data for Blacks, Whites, those of ""other"" races, and those selecting more than one race. Tabulations which incorporate the Hispanic or Latino subgroup information can be developed by expanding Table F. Since respondents are free to select one or more categories in the combined format, data collected from a survey or administrative reporting where a combined format is used can also be tabulated using Tables E or F.  33    Table A.

USING DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY COLLECTED UNDER THE NEW STANDARDS  This part of the report discusses some important uses of data under the new standards, reflecting in large measure work that is ongoing. A. Redistricting One of the first official statutory uses of data on race and ethnicity collected under the new standards will be for legislative redistricting following Census 2000. The new data format should not require substantial changes in the way redistricting will be conducted. How the 1990 Census Racial and Ethnic Data Were Used The 1990 census Public Law 94-171 (""redistricting count"") tabulations (which were released to the states for redistricting purposes) reported data down to the block level for the total population and the voting age population (ages 18 years and older) for four racial groups (American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and White) and a residual category (""other"" race). Data on these racial groups were also cross-tabulated by Hispanic origin. Categories were mutually exclusive (each person was counted only once), and the categories added to the total population reported for a geographic region. States and political subdivisions that are covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act are required to demonstrate, to the United States Attorney General or to a Federal district court in the District of Columbia, that their redistricting plans will not reduce the voting strength of their minority citizens and that the plans do not have a racially discriminatory purpose. All states and political subdivisions, however, are prohibited by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act from using redistricting plans that have the effect of diluting their resident' voting strength on account of s race. The U.S. Department of Justice or private citizens may file lawsuits to enforce these laws. In order to comply with those Federal laws, states and their political subdivisions used the redistricting count tabulations to assess the racial and ethnic compositions and distributions of their residents as they drew their redistricting plans. The data were used to identify areas in which racial and ethnic minorities were residentially segregated, in order, for example, to avoid splintering those areas among several districts. The data also were used in some areas to determine whether voting patterns were racially polarized. After the redistricting process was complete, courts would rely on the redistricting count data, together with other evidence, to decide any legal challenge that was filed against the redistricting plan. How the 2000 Census Data Can Be Used for Redistricting in 2001 In Census 2000 the major changes to the reporting of data on race and ethnicity are (1) the instruction to ""mark one or more"" racial categories and (2) the splitting of the ""Asian or Pacific 41    Islander"" category into two separate categories -- ""Asian"" and ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander."" Hispanic or Latino origin will be ascertained in a separate question, as in 1990 census. For the purposes of the 2000 Census Dress Rehearsal, the Census Bureau will provide tabulations of the number of persons who identified with only one of the five individual racial categories or with the residual category (""single race"" counts), plus tabulations of the total number of persons who identified with each of the five individual racial categories either alone (e.g., White only) or in combination with any other categories (e.g., White plus any other racial category), referred to as ""all inclusive"" counts. Both the ""single race"" counts and the ""all inclusive"" counts will be cross-tabulated by Hispanic or Latino origin. It should be noted that the ""all inclusive"" counts will add to more than 100 percent of the population since a person' response will be counted in all of s the racial categories selected. (See Appendix C for more information on Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal prototype redistricting data.) It is not expected that provision of the redistricting count data in the new format will lead to significant changes in redistricting practices or decisions. The new data categories will not affect the total population counts used for the apportionment of Congress, or for compliance with one person, one-vote requirements. Once the Dress Rehearsal data are released and analyzed, there will be more information available about the practical effects of the new standards. It can be expected that the more that the single count and all-inclusive-count populations share the same residential patterns, the less likely it will be that jurisdictions'redistricting choices will affect those populations differently. Research also has indicated that, at least nationwide, there is unlikely to be a significant difference between the ""single count"" Black population and the ""all-inclusive"" Black population. In addition, jurisdictions with substantial Hispanic or Latino populations will have a separate count of all persons identifying themselves as Hispanic or Latino, because ethnicity is collected in a separate question. Alternatives to the single-race/all-inclusive approach to redistricting data are under consideration. The U. S. Department of Justice has not yet reached a decision on the question of whether advantages would result from the use of one of the allocation methods described in Appendix D for voting rights issues. While allocation does not conform with the criterion that data uses should reflect ""congruence with respondent' choice,"" it would facilitate comparisons with the s 1990 census data. (Allocation methods assign an individual' multiple race response to a single s race category.) Some have suggested that an allocation approach would have the advantage of giving redistricting authorities, the states and their political subdivisions, one number to use in making their redistricting choices. Others have suggested that instead it would require states to use and consider three data sets: single-race counts, all-inclusive counts, and the allocated counts. If a decision is made to use an allocation approach, the Department of Justice would discuss with the Census Bureau the technical feasibility of including matrices using the chosen allocation method in the PL 94-171 data files or producing a special tabulation with such data after the Census Bureau has met its legal deadline of April 1, 2001, for producing the data specified in PL 94-171. The working group would appreciate feedback from users on these issues. 42    B. Equal Employment Opportunity One of the Federal Government' most significant uses of data on race and ethnicity is in its s efforts to ensure that every individual has an equal opportunity for employment. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination in employment based upon race, color, sex, religion, and national origin. Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, similarly prohibits discrimination in employment by government contractors. Executive Order 11246 also requires contractors covered by its provisions to ensure affirmatively that they do not discriminate against their employees and applicants for employment. Responsibility for equal employment opportunity is shared among a number of Federal agencies including: the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Justice, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in the Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Department of Education. Title VII is enforced by the EEOC against private employers and by the Department of Justice against state and local government employers. Executive Order 11246 is enforced by the OFCCP. Representatives from these agencies 1997 standards for reporting of data data related activities carried out by used, the changes the agencies have under discussion. have been meeting to determine how best to implement the on race and ethnicity. This section describes some of the the agencies, how the data were previously collected and agreed upon, and some of the alternatives that are currently  As the new standards are implemented, agencies whose primary mission is civil rights enforcement will face particularly complex challenges. The EEO agencies will continue to consider the burden imposed on those responding to data requests as they make various tabulation, aggregation, and other decisions. All participants in these important decisions are reminded that it is not the intent of the 1997 standards to diminish the availability and quality of information collected and available for Federal civil rights enforcement and related purposes. Data Needs and Uses There are two basic theories of employment discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate impact. Disparate treatment can either affect individuals because of their protected characteristics, or in pattern and practice cases, it can affect all persons in the group who have an employment relationship with that employer. Individual disparate treatment cases rely primarily on evidence of how an individual was treated in comparison to other similarly situated individuals. In some instances, statistical evidence of disparities in treatment between similarly situated individuals can suggest that some individuals were subject to employment discrimination because of their protected class status. In disparate impact cases, statistics on the number of available and qualified minority workers for 43    a particular job are compared with statistics on the employer' workforce. Enforcement agencies s compare statistics on the racial breakdown of an employer' workforce to the racial composition s of the available qualified labor pool. These analyses also consider statistics on the jobholder' s employment-related characteristics, such as educational attainment or occupational experience, compared with similar data on those persons qualified for, and interested in, the at-issue jobs. This analysis is the first step in determining whether there is reason to believe that the employer' s selection procedures improperly excluded individuals on the basis of their race, ethnicity, or gender. After this analysis, the employer may be asked to show that its selection procedures for the position(s) in question are job-related and consistent with business necessity. The workforce data often come from the employer' annual reports filed with Federal agencies (see ""Data on s Employer' Workforce"" below), and the benchmark data come from a special file covering EEO s related data drawn from the most recent decennial census (see ""The Benchmark File"" below.) In some disparate impact cases, the selection or de-selection rates of different groups within the employer' workforce are compared without reference to external benchmarks. s Data on Employer' Work Force. Data on an employer' workforce are collected annually on s s the Employer Information Reports (EEO-1 and EEO-4 surveys) covering private and state or local government employment, respectively, and on the EEO-5 and IPEDS (formerly EEO-6) surveys of employment in elementary/secondary and higher education, respectively. The current EEO forms collect general information about the employer and its workforce. Employers provide counts of employees within nine job categories by gender and five racial/ethnic categories (White -not of Hispanic origin, Black--not of Hispanic origin, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native) for each facility. The Benchmark File. In 1990, a special EEO file based on the decennial census data was produced by the Census Bureau, in accordance with specifications provided by the EEO agencies. It included five matrices of counts for various geographic entities including the United States, States, metropolitan areas, counties, and places of 50,000 or more in population. The five tables presented various cross-tabulations of the number of people in each labor force category by gender, EEO racial/ethnic categories (six categories, the five noted above plus ""other, not of Hispanic origin""), occupation (512 categories), industry (98 categories), educational attainment (six categories), earnings (9 categories) or age (seven categories). Summary of Data Use for EEO Analysis. The basic inquiry requires identification of the relevant labor force for each case, followed by a determination as to whether the employer' work s force differs to a statistically significant extent from the benchmark comparison group. The relevant labor force depends on the employment action at issue. For entry-level positions that require few skills or experience, the benchmark may be some lesser skilled subset of the civilian labor force in the geographic area in which the employer operates. Depending on the qualifications required for a position, the relevant labor force may be further delineated, for example, by age, education, or occupation. For promotions, the relevant labor pool typically will be the employees eligible for the promotion. The basic inquiry is always the same: is the number/percent of, for example, Blacks, found in the employer' work force significantly s 44    different from the number of Blacks that would be expected to be found based on the percentage of qualified and interested Blacks in the labor force. The comparative information on the labor force generally comes from the benchmark file from the most recent decennial census. The wide range of factors, e.g. qualifications, availability, location, affecting employment decisions by both employers and individual workers influences whether the employer' work s force will replicate the availability of individuals at any level of labor force aggregation. Absent discriminatory practices, it is also unlikely that significant disparities should exist between the proportion of qualified minority or female workers in positions throughout the employer' work s force and the available and qualified labor pool. Statistical analysis measures the disparity between the actual participation of minorities or women in the employer' workforce and their expected representation to determine whether any disparity s can be attributed to chance. The analysis is based on an assumption that available and qualified minorities and women are recruited, apply and are selected on a nondiscriminatory basis by the employer. Following statistical practice, if the likelihood of chance differences is less than 0.05 (the five percent probability significance level), regulatory agencies and the courts generally accept the alternative inference that unlawful factors may have influenced employer' decision making. In s litigation, this inference can constitute a prima facie showing of discrimination, which then requires the employer to explain its practices or face liability. In several cases, the Supreme Court accepted the use of a statistic approximating the five percent probability level, a two-three standard deviation difference, but emphasized that a range of techniques can be used to reflect the fact patterns of each case. See Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 311 n. 17 (1977), and Watson v. Ft. Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 995 n.3 (1988). The following example illustrates the statistical comparison of the racial profile of an employer' s workforce and the racial profile of similar job-holders in that employer' labor market area. In this s example, the ABC Corporation, a large producer of computer software in City X, employs 350 programmers. Eleven, or 3.2 percent of these programmers are Black. Using the decennial census benchmark data, it is found that Blacks constitute 3.72 percent of available programmers working in City X. Using that benchmark proportion, the expected number of Black programmers in a company in City X with 350 programmers is found to be 13 (3.72 percent times 350). The difference between the number of Black programmers in ABC Corporation and the number expected is minus 2 (11 minus 13). In ""standard deviation1"" terms, the disparity (-2/350) is -.57 standard deviations. Such a difference, while negative, is not statistically significant (to be statistically significant, it would need to be less than -1.96). Thus, the number of Black computer programmers employed by the ABC Corporation is not suggestive The standard deviation is computed as sqrt(p(1-p)/n), where p is the fraction from the benchmark file, and n is the number of employees in the company. 45 1   of an under representation of Black programmers in the employer' workforce. s Changes Needed to EEO Forms and Instructions to Meet the New Standards Employer Record-keeping. The instructions accompanying the current EEO forms state that the race and ethnicity of an employer's work force may be obtained either by ""visual surveys of the work force, or from post-employment records."" The instructions state explicitly that eliciting information from the employee via direct inquiry is not encouraged. With the implementation of the 1997 standards, this guidance will change. Self-identification will be the preferred method of collecting data on race and ethnicity from employees. Employers will also be encouraged to use the two-question format with Hispanic ethnicity first, and to allow those employees who wish to do so to select more than one race. Employers will be asked to maintain this information in their data files. It is currently thought that employers will not be required to resurvey current staff, although some will likely do so. If employers do not resurvey current staff, the data available to be collected on the EEO forms will only slowly become comparable to the benchmark data reported in Census 2000. The OFCCP regulations do not specify how Federal contractors (employers) should gather the data necessary to complete the work force analysis or the utilization analysis for Affirmative Action Programs. The implementing regulations, however, require the filing of an EEO-1 report and, by implication, the data reported in the work force utilization analysis must be consistent with the EEO-1 reporting requirements. Planned Changes to the EEO Forms. To be consistent with the new standards, the following changes to the EEO forms are planned: (1) (2) Add a separate category ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"" to EEO forms and instructions, and replace the category ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" with ""Asian."" Make a. b. c. the following changes in terminology: The term ""Eskimo or Aleut"" replaced by ""Alaska Native,"" The term ""Black"" replaced by ""Black or African-American,"" and The term ""Hispanic"" replaced by ""Hispanic or Latino.""  (3)  Capture Hispanic or Latino ethnicity in a separate category or question.  These planned changes do not incorporate a change of instructions to ""mark one or more races."" It has not yet been determined how best to revise the forms that collect aggregations of data about the employer' workforce to account for individuals who report more than one race. s Efforts to date to design and test an aggregate reporting form are discussed earlier in this report. Alternatives for using the data for EEO purposes (that might lead to changes in the EEO forms) are described below.  46    Ensuring Common Approaches in EEO Reporting The Federal civil rights enforcement agencies agree that they should adopt common data base definitions for the racial and ethnic categories used to enforce EEO laws and regulations. Clearly, whatever system is adopted, the enforcement agencies will need to consider the complex issues related to implementing the new standards, bridging to EEO enforcement conducted using data collected under the old standard, and continuing to conduct the important business of ensuring equal employment opportunity during the transition years. Because of the complexities in collecting and using the data reported under the new standards for civil rights enforcement purposes, the EEO agencies are still in the process of considering the best way to analyze these data. A number of alternative approaches are currently under review. Three alternatives are briefly described in the following sections. Each alternative would require the preparation of a suitable decennial census benchmark file. Readers are invited to comment on these alternatives and to suggest additional ideas and options. Tabulation Alternative 1: Using a Bridging Method. The EEO agencies have considered the methods discussed in Appendix D of this report, and have concluded that one of the allocation methods proposed for bridging would be useful during the transition period. The EEO agencies considered the allocation method that assigns an individual who selected more than one race to the largest of the nonwhite groups he/she marked as a viable alternative for EEO purposes. The largest nonwhite group may be ascertained from the racial composition of the population for the relevant geography. This allocation method can be used to assign responses from individuals who reported more than one race to single race categories. With this method, no change would be needed in the statistical methods currently used by the EEO agencies, and for a few years, employers who begin collecting data under the new standards would use this allocation method to report on their EEO forms the racial data for new hires who select more than one race. Employers could also be asked to record on their EEO forms the total number of individuals in their files who selected more than one race. This would provide the EEO agencies with a measure of the changing racial characteristics in work force data and would indicate when the final alternative should be implemented. This method represents an interim solution that would precede full implementation of the new standards. Following careful evaluation of Census 2000 data, decisions could be made that phase in the new standards in an analytically appropriate manner. Tabulation Alternative 2: The Lower and Upper Boundary Approach. Under the new standards, employees will be able to identify themselves as members of more than one racial group. As a result, some individuals who were identified as members of only one group, for example, Black, under the previous standards, may now identify as members of more than one group, for example, Black and White, under the new standards. Thus, when data are reported it will be possible to determine two counts for each racial group. The lower count, or lower 47    boundary, will be those individuals who identify with one race only, for example those who marked only the Black category. The larger count, or upper boundary, adds to the lower boundary those individuals who identify with the given racial category and one or more other racial categories. Thus, the upper boundary Black count includes everyone who marked Black either alone or in combination with one or more other racial categories. The remainder of the population consists of those individuals who did not identify as Black. As a practical matter, in most geographic locations the upper and lower boundaries will not currently be substantially different for purposes of employment data because few adults are expected to report themselves as members of more than one racial group. This assessment is based upon data provided in Appendix D of this report, and documentation of the National Content Survey and the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test conducted by the Census Bureau. Data from some geographic regions are expected to reflect larger numbers and percentages of respondents reporting themselves as belonging to more than one racial group. An interagency group is working on possible modifications to survey forms, such as the EEO-1, that collect aggregated data on the characteristics of many individuals for a single organization, to capture information needed for the upper/lower boundary approach. The tests conducted to date are described in detail in Appendix B of this report. Tabulation Alternative 3: Collect Micro Data from Employers. An alternative approach to using an aggregate reporting form, similar to the EEO-1, is to ask respondents to provide a micro data file containing one record (without identifiers) for each employee. The micro record would include the employee' race or races, ethnicity, gender, and occupational category. This approach s might be simpler for employers, and would provide agencies the maximum amount of flexibility in using the information. Implementation of this approach appears to be a longer-term solution. The EEO agencies would need to work with respondents in designing and implementing the reporting format and method, and they would need to acquire the relevant software and hardware to process the information. Illustrations of Comparisons Under Alternative Tabulation Approaches To illustrate the alternatives, consider the example described earlier in this section. Recall that the ABC Corporation, a large producer of computer software in City X, employs 350 programmers. It is assumed that the ABC Corporation started maintaining self-reported data on race (allowing employees to select one or more races) for their new hires more than a year ago. As a result, their internal files contain a mixture of data collected under the old and new standards. For their 250 programmers hired before the new standards were implemented, information on race in internal files is recorded as one of the four racial groups. These files indicate that 8, or 3.2 percent of the long-term programming staff members, are Black. For the 100 recent employees, race is recorded as one or more of the five groups. According to these records, one of the new programmers has reported that he is Black, one has reported that she is Black and White, and one has reported that he is Black and American Indian. None of the other 97 individuals hired after the new standards 48    were implemented reported Black either alone or in combination with another race. In benchmark have reported have reported and American race or races. data based on Census 2000, the following percentages of programmers in City X that they are Black: 3.3 percent have reported the single race Black, .23 percent that they are Black and White, and .11 percent have reported that they are Black Indian. A total of .42 percent have reported that they are Black and some other  Comparisons Under Alternative 1: Allocation. Because there are more Blacks in City X than any racial group other than White, under the allocation method known as ""largest non-white group"", ABC Corporation would count the 8 long term Black employees and the 3 new employees who selected Black alone or in combination with another race, and report that they have 11 Black programmers (approximately 3.2 percent of their programmers). Similarly the benchmark proportions would count in the Black category everyone who marked Black either alone or with other race(s). This would count a total of 3.72 percent of the available programmers as Black. With these transformations, the counts and percentages are identical to the example provided earlier and the analysis would lead to identical results. If a different racial group were used in the analysis, or a different allocation method were used, results would not necessarily be identical to the earlier example. Comparisons Under Alternative 2: Upper/ Lower Bound. For the upper/ lower bound method, ABC Corporation would report that they have 9 programmers (2.6 percent) in the single race (or lower boundary) Black category, and 2 employees (.6 percent) who have reported Black in combination with another race. Thus, the ""all inclusive"" (or upper boundary) count for Black programmers is 11 (3.2 percent). The benchmark file has 3.3 percent of the programmers in the single race (or lower boundary) Black category, and .42 percent of the programmers who report as Black and at least one other race, yielding a total of 3.72 percent of programmers in the ""all inclusive"" (or upper boundary) category. Given past patterns of discrimination, one would most likely argue that the ""all inclusive"" category would be most appropriate to use. In this example, the resulting counts and percentages are identical to the example provided earlier, and to the results of the allocation method. The analysis could be conducted using the data for the single race category -- or lower bound, as follows. Using the benchmark proportion 3.2 percent, the expected number of Black programmers in a company with 350 programmers in City X is found to be 11 (approximately 3.2 percent of 350). The difference between the number of single race Black programmers in ABC Corporation and the number expected is minus 2 (9 minus 11). In ""standard deviation"" terms the disparity (-2/350) is -.61. This difference is not statistically significant (to be statistically 49    significant, it would need to be less than -1.96). Thus, the number of Black computer programmers employed by the ABC Corporation is not suggestive of an under representation of Black computer programmers in the employer' work force. In this case, the analysis using the s lower bound leads to the same conclusion as the analysis using the upper bound, though the numbers are somewhat different. Note that if a different allocation method was used with tabulation alternative 1, or if one of the other racial groups were used in the example, the upper bound (""all inclusive"" count) would not be identical to the count based on the tabulation allocation method. The reader is referred to Appendix D for a detailed discussion of the impact of the various allocation methods. Comparison Alternative 3: Full Data Reporting. With this method, ABC Corporation will compile a micro data listing of employee characteristics to submit for EEO purposes. The table below illustrates the contents of such a micro data file. This example is intended to illustrate the complete recording of sex, race, and ethnicity. It makes use of the single job category ""programmer,"" and therefore cannot be viewed as a real prototype for EEO reporting. In this table X denotes ""yes,"" zero denotes ""no,"" and blank indicates that the data are not available. The first record (employee number 1) is a Black, non-Hispanic male programmer. His data are recorded in the new format: he was hired after the new reporting system was adopted and had an opportunity to self-select one or more races. He chose to report himself as Black. On the other hand, employee 4 has been an employee for some time, and his data are in the old format. He is also a Black male programmer, but the information provided in this record is what was recorded in the company files prior to conversion to the new reporting system. If this type of information became available from all employers, the EEO agencies could use any of the tests described above, or they would be able to transition to applying the EEO methodology to any groups that become large enough to monitor for EEO, including those that involve more than one race.  50    Illustration of Part of Micro Data File for ABC Corporation ___________________________________________________________________ Employee Sex Hispanic Race Programmer New Format Number WBIAH ___________________________________________________________________ 1 M 0 0 X00 0 X X 2 F X XX00 0 X X 3 M 0 0XX0 0 X X 4 M 0 0X0 0 X 0 5 F 0 0X0 0 X 0 6 F 0 0X0 0 X 0 7 M 0 0X0 0 X 0 8 F 0 0X0 0 X 0 9 M X 0X0 0 X 0 10 M 0 0X0 0 X 0 11 M 0 0X0 0 X 0 12 F X X0 0 0 0 X X 13 . . ... . . . . ___________________________________________________________________ W=White B=Black I=American Indian and Alaska Native A=Asian H=Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Comparisons using Tabulation Alternative 3 would require benchmark data from the Census Bureau for a subset of the 63 different unique combinations of reporting of race.

Vital Records and Intercensal Estimates The revisions to the standards for collecting and presenting Federal data on race and ethnicity pose many challenges to the Census Bureau' Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Because s the population estimates are data driven, changes to the program to provide new racial categories will depend upon the availability of data from a variety of sources. Although changes are possible, it will require discussions with data providers and data users, as well as research and analysis of data collected under the new standards, before the Census Bureau can identify the racial categories that can be used in the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Following some background discussion, this section presents a description of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program, its methodology, and its major uses, and then turns to some of the major issues that must be addressed. Background In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting. Because the intercensal population estimates are limited in their detail by the availability of administrative data, it was not until 1993 that the Intercensal Population Estimates Program could modify its racial categories to follow fully the 1977 standards by providing data for the population in the four major racial categories -- White; Black; Asian or Pacific Islander; and American Indian, Eskimo and Aleut. To comply with the 1977 standards, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program developed estimates by race separately for the population by Hispanic origin (Hispanic, non-Hispanic). The 1997 standards present many challenges with two in particular posing the greatest challenge. One is that respondents to Federal data collections, including Census 2000, surveys, and vital statistics registrations, will be allowed to select one or more races. The other is that the Asian or Pacific Islander aggregate category has been split into two categories -- one called ""Asian"" and the other called ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander."" Because the intercensal population estimates serve several diverse purposes, exploring the possible outcomes of the estimates process and examining the implications of the new standards are important. The intercensal population estimates are used as controls for many Federal surveys, as denominators for important Federal statistics, and as indicators for important program and policy decisions. Because the considerable can produce describe the outputs. issues raised by the 1997 standards are complicated and diverse, it will take research and experimentation before the Intercensal Population Estimates Program population estimates outputs that fully follow the new standards. The next sections program and discuss the major issues that must be addressed in changing program  52    What is the Intercensal Population Estimates Program? The Intercensal Population Estimates Program, under Title 13, develops and releases annual estimates of the total population and its demographic characteristics. For the Nation, states, and counties, these characteristics include annual estimates by: Age -Sex -Race-Hispanic origin -single years of age (age 0 to age 99) and 100+;  Male/Female  White; Black; Asian and Pacific Islander; and American Indian,  Eskimo, and Aleut; Hispanic/non-Hispanic  The Intercensal Population Estimates Program currently provides estimates of the total population of functioning governmental units (cities, incorporated places, and minor civil divisions). The Census Bureau is considering expansion of the program to include smaller and more diverse units of geography (such as School Districts), as well as the development of demographic characteristics for functioning governmental units and other smaller geographic units. How Are the Population Estimates Used? The population estimates are used in the intercensal period for funding allocations, as controls for Census Bureau and other Federal surveys, as denominators for vital statistics and other demographic events, and as planning tools for government and private programs. Funding Allocations. Federal programs totaling $180 billion use these annual population estimates to make important program decisions and to distribute these funds. Survey Controls. The population estimates are used as control totals for the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the new American Community Survey (ACS), other Federal surveys, as well as many private surveys. Most Federal surveys use national level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. The ACS currently uses county level population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as controls for weighting survey data. Denominators for Demographic Events. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) currently uses the national, state, and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators to create birth and death rates and to calculate life tables by race and sex. In addition to the use by NCHS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) frequently relies upon the estimates of population at various geographic levels as denominators for various health related and disease incidence rates. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) uses the county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin as denominators for the various cancer incidence rates released to the public. 53    Planning Tools. The intercensal population estimates are frequently used as planning tools and as barometers to measure an area' growth and change since the last decennial census. In making s important policy decisions, local planners frequently cite the overall population level and the demographic characteristics products of the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. Methodology for Developing Intercensal Population Estimates The Intercensal Population Estimates Program develops its population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin using the demographically recognized cohort-component technique. In this technique, each component of population change -- births, deaths, international migration, and internal migration -- is estimated separately by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Various administrative records provide information needed to develop these components of population change. The estimates process begins with the most recent decennial census results and combines the estimated components of population change to develop the intercensal population estimates. The 1990 Census Base Population. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net undercoverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made in the distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. (See Comparability Issues below for a complete discussion of the modification of the 1990 Decennial Census.) Birth and Death Components. In brief, NCHS provides annual counts and distributions of births and deaths by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin by county to the Census Bureau in a specially developed individual record file of the birth and death events. These individual records contain the detailed race and Hispanic classifications available from the birth and death certificates collected by NCHS. International Migration Component. The international net migration components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. The Census Bureau estimates the distribution by race and Hispanic origin from the country-of-birth tallies, using data from the 1990 Census on the foreign-born population who entered the United States from 1985 to 1990. The other components of international migration such as emigration and undocumented migration are developed using a combination of basic demographic modeling techniques. By examining data from other administrative records in combination with an analysis of the decennial census, the Census Bureau models the level and demographic characteristics of these other international migration components. Internal Migration Component. The data on internal migration are developed using a basic 54    administrative records method. This method relies on annual extracts of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In this approach, using the Social Security Number (SSN) on the return, The Census Bureau can match the tax returns for two years and obtain state of residence for the two periods. By comparing the state of residence at the two points in time, annual measures of migration can be developed for states. Until recently, the Census Bureau had only developed the national population estimates by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population for states and counties. During the current decade, the Census Bureau started to develop a set of state and county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. These state population estimates are developed using the basic cohort component technique outlined above. Since the standard tax return provides no demographic characteristics of the tax filer, the Census Bureau must further modify the basic administrative records method to estimate internal migration by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To obtain demographic characteristics, the Bureau has relied on the annual extract of tax returns provided by the IRS, and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration Application File (NUMIDENT). This NUMIDENT file includes SSN, month and year of birth, race, sex, and six characters of the last name for each SSN holder in the sample file. The extract of the NUMIDENT file has been merged with the tax returns file by SSN to derive demographic characteristics of IRS filers. Because the Census Bureau was able to receive only a 20% sample of this basic NUMIDENT file, the Bureau appended the demographic characteristics of the primary filer to only the same 20 percent sample of tax returns. Besides demographic characteristics of the primary filers, the model requires demographic characteristics of those persons claimed as exemptions on the tax return. The rules for assigning demographic characteristics to dependents are straightforward and rely on basic familial and demographic relationships. Because until this year, the NUMIDENT File was restricted to a 20 percent sample, the Census Bureau could not use the merged tax file and SSA data to develop county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. To develop the current sets of county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, a ratio approach is employed. This approach combines the full set of age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin detail for the county in 1990 with the newly developed state population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin and the estimates of the total population of the county. With the delivery of the 100 percent NUMIDENT file to the Census Bureau, work on employing the cohort component technique to develop the county estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin is anticipated. Data Availability The intercensal population estimates are ""data driven."" As noted above, the decennial census, the 55    National Center for Health Statistics, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Social Security Administration are all important sources for developing intercensal population estimates. Using the current methodology, estimates cannot be produced without the availability of these data. Decennial Census Data. The Census 2000 will mark the first time that decennial population data are available using the new OMB standards for collecting racial data. The Census Bureau is developing the approaches and timetables for tabulating these data from the Census 2000. Birth and Death Data. The National Vital Statistics System is the basis for the Nation' official s statistics on births and deaths (including infant deaths). The data are provided through vital registration systems maintained and operated by the individual states and territories where the original certificates are filed. While the legal authority for vital registration rests with the states and territories, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is required to produce national vital statistics by collecting data from the vital records of all the states. The NCHS cooperates with the states in developing the standard forms for data collection as well as standard procedures for data preparation and processing in order to promote a uniform national data base. The NCHS shares in the costs incurred by the states through contractual agreements with each state. Under this arrangement, NCHS obtains and publishes vital statistics based on all births and deaths (e.g., 3,891,494 and 2,314,690, respectively, in 1996) occurring in the United States. Implementation of the 1997 standards on vital records will require changes in data collection and processing systems at all levels of government and very likely will take at least several years to accomplish throughout the United States. In addition to revising computer systems at the state and Federal levels, the electronic software that is used in hospitals to record and report over 90 percent of all births in the United States needs to be converted. Most importantly, the procedures used to collect birth and death data in hospitals and funeral homes will need to be revised and the appropriate staff need to be trained. It can be anticipated that not all registration areas will implement the 1997 standards at the same time or with complete coverage and compliance at the start. For example, some states may implement the revised race question on birth and death certificates in the year 2000 in order to be compatible with Census 2000, while others may prefer or need to wait until the next revisions of the U.S. Standard Certificates of Birth and Death are implemented in 2002. During 1998 and 1999, the NCHS is sponsoring a committee of state vital statistics officials and representatives of the relevant professions in a series of meetings to evaluate the entire content and format of the current Standard Certificates. The committee' goal is to submit certificate revisions to the s Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in July 1999 for clearance by the Department. Implementation by the registration areas is expected to occur in January 2002. Some states have indicated a desire to make changes in the race and ethnicity items at the same time as other changes are made. International Migration Components. As discussed above, the international migration 56    components are based on a variety of administrative sources and analytic estimates. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) supplies data on legal immigrants. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) supplies data on persons admitted to the United States as refugees. Both sources supply data on country of birth. To develop data on the race and Hispanic origin of the entering immigrants, the Census Bureau combines the information on country of birth from the INS files with information from the most recent decennial census. Because the INS and other data sources on international migration do not code race or Hispanic origin, no change in these sources is anticipated. The Census Bureau will need to examine the results of Census 2000 and develop new algorithms to accommodate the revised categories for data on race. Internal Migration Components. To develop the internal migration component, the Census Bureau currently relies upon the annual extract of tax returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a 20 percent sample of information on the Social Security Administration Application File (NUMIDENT). Under an agreement between the Census Bureau and the Social Security Administration, the Census Bureau has recently gained access to a full 100 percent NUMIDENT file. This opens additional opportunities for developing subnational population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. This component also presents the biggest obstacle to modifying categories for data on race in the intercensal population estimates process. Under the Social Security system, data on race are provided as part of the Social Security card application process. For the oldest among the population currently covered in the NUMIDENT files, the last application date could refer to the beginning of the Social Security system. Until 1980, the Social Security Administration application system provided three racial categories -- White, Black, and Other. Beginning in 1980, the SSA modified the racial categories on the SSA application form to include five categories -- (1) Asian, Asian-American or Pacific Islander; (2) Hispanic; (3) Black (non-Hispanic); (4) North American Indian or Alaskan Native; (5) White (non-Hispanic). Although SSA modified the racial categories application card, people who already had an SSA card did not have to resubmit their data on race. Thus, pre-1980 entries on the SSA file have information for three racial categories (White, Black, and Other), while entries after 1980 have information for five racial categories. The application for a Social Security card needs to be updated to reflect the 1997 standards. Another change to the Social Security application procedure has presented challenges to the use of data on race. Beginning in the late 1980's, the Social Security Administration introduced the ""enumeration at birth program."" Under this program, parents could request a Social Security Number for their newborn children with the birth registration process. Because the birth certificates do not include racial information for the newborn, it is impossible to code race for the newborn onto the SSA file. While information on race is available for the birth mother and father on the basic birth registration certificate, this data are not made available to the Social Security 57    Administration and is not on the basic NUMIDENT file received by the Census Bureau. Comparability Issues Even the availability of the required source data does not ensure the capability to produce reasonable and accurate population estimates. Production of population estimates by the major demographic characteristics depends upon the availability of comparable data across the various data sources. While comparability issues with respect to race reporting are not new, the increased complexities of the new racial categories are likely to exacerbate the problems. The issues about comparability in race reporting are present in the current set of intercensal population estimates. Data from the 1990 census on race posed several of these problems. Although the enumeration of the resident population in the 1990 census, without adjustment for net under coverage, was adopted as a standard for the estimates, changes were made to that distribution of the population by age and race. These modifications were made to bring the definition of age and race into conformity with definitions used for data from other sources, such as vital statistics. For age, the aim was to correct biases in census age tabulations that resulted from displacement of age reporting from the reference date of the census. In 1990 census publications, age is based on respondents' direct reports of age at last birthday, with some editing for age misstatement. This definition proved inadequate for postcensal estimates however, as many respondents reported their age (even if correctly) at the time of completion of the census form or interview by an enumerator, either of which could have occurred several months after the April 1 reference date. As a result, age was slightly biased upward. Modification was based on a respecification of age, for most individual respondents, according to their year of birth. Age was derived from year of birth by allocating date of birth to the first quarter and last three quarters of each year, subtracting year of birth from 1990 for those born before April 1, and from 1989 for those born after April 1. The allocation was based on an historical series of registered births by month. For race, the objective of the modification was to conform to the definition of race specified in the 1977 standards. In the 1990 census, a substantial number of people (roughly 9.8 million) did not specify a racial group that could be classified in any of the categories on the census form: White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander. A large majority of these people were of Hispanic origin (based on their response to a separate, Hispanic origin question on the form), and many wrote in their Hispanic origin, or Hispanic origin type (for example, Mexican or Puerto Rican) as their race. People of unspecified race were allocated to one of the four tabulated racial groups (White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo or Aleut; and Asian or Pacific Islander) based on their response to the Hispanic origin question. These four categories for race conform with the 1977 standards, and are more consistent with the categories in other administrative sources than are the original census tabulations.  58    Census 2000 will pose challenges about reporting of race. The expanded number of categories and the possibility for reporting more than one race translates into over 60 possibilities. The large number of categories that are likely to have few responses will present challenges to the Intercensal Population Estimates Program. When combining across data sets and agencies, the problems of comparability in reporting of become more severe. Clearly, the added complexity of reporting more than one race will add this problem, particularly as different reporting situations (such as the census or the birth and death certificates) engender differential tendencies to report more than one race. Differences allocation and editing procedures will almost certainly exacerbate the problem as exemplified the problem of using data from different data universes in the calculation of rates. Future Direction The process of developing a set of intercensal population estimates consistent with the 1997 standards will not be an easy one. Until data are available, making any commitments about the probable set of products is impossible. The Census Bureau realizes, however, that many data users need to know its plans in order to make their own program decisions. To begin this process, the Census Bureau is forming a technical interagency group of key data providers and key data users to address many of the major issues. Members of this group will provide input on: (1) the feasibility of using one consistent set of categories on race across all geographic levels; (2) the feasibility of using population size as the only criteria for determining which categories by race will have separate population estimates; (3) the minimum cell size below which population estimates will not be produced; (4) the continued development of population estimates by mutually exclusive categories on race; and (5) the use of consistent methodologies for the different categories by race in the population estimates program. This technical group will also examine issues related to data allocation and editing -- important factors related to the data consistency issues. Although detailed data on race from Census 2000 will not be available until mid 2001, during the next few months, the interagency group can address and reach consensus on most of the issues outlined above. Through these discussions with the data providers and data users, the Intercensal Population Estimates Program can begin to form some tentative plans. Although it is too soon to speculate on any outcomes, it is likely that the Intercensal Population Estimates Program will need to be flexible. During the coming decade, as more data become available using the 1997 standards, it is likely that the Census Bureau will continue the expansion of the population estimates program to include additional categories by race. race to in by  59    D. Issues for Further Research (Under Development)  60    V.  COMPARING DATA UNDER THE OLD AND THE NEW STANDARDS  This part of the report provides a summary of the Bridge Report: Tabulation Options for Trend Analysis, which is contained in Appendix D. A. Introduction Agencies whose data are used to display time trends in economic, social, and health characteristics by racial and ethnic groups may need to consider bridging methods to assist users in understanding the data collected under the new standard. For some period of time, referred to as the bridge period, agencies may display historical data along with two estimates for the present time period. The first, a tabulation of the data collected under the new standard (see Part III B), and the second, a ""bridging estimate"" or prediction of how the responses would have been collected and coded under the old standard. Once the bridge period is over, the bridge estimates will no longer be needed. It should not be assumed that bridging is useful or required in every situation. Agencies should carefully consider whether they need bridging estimates. Bridging estimates may not be needed if agencies can tolerate a ""break"" in their data series or if comparison to another data series provides users with enough information about the change. If bridging estimates are not used, however, agencies should footnote the first occurrence of data collected under the new standard. There are at least two purposes of bridge estimates: (1) to help users understand the relationship between the old and new data series (as noted above); and (2) to provide consistent numerators and denominators for the transition period, before all data are available in the new format. If there is a need for bridging, agencies should carefully evaluate alternative methods. The work presented in Appendix D, and summarized below, is intended to help inform agencies about the statistical characteristics of selected bridging methods. Agencies are encouraged to plan and conduct methodological research that will lead to more informed decisions concerning bridging methods and their uses. Such methodological research has long been used to quantify changes in data collection procedures. For example, when methods for coding industry, occupation, or diseases are updated, it is common practice to code data using both sets of coding rules to determine the nature and extent of the changes introduced by the change in procedures. The analyses presented in Appendix D make use of survey data in which the same respondent provided racial information in response to both a question structured under the old standard, and in response to questions similar to those that might be structured under the new standard. These are examples of methodological approaches that can be adopted by agencies, if necessary. In particular, since 1976, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has added a follow-up question for those reporting more than one racial identity, asking them to select the one that they feel best describes them. This information is directly used in some of the most promising bridge 61    techniques. Some agencies may find that adding such a follow-up question to the questions on race and ethnicity, even just once after the implementation of the new standards, would provide valuable survey-specific information for bridging to the past. As agencies conduct such experiments, the results may assist other agencies in understanding the changes associated with transitioning to the new standard. The results discussed here and in Appendix D represent the work of a group of statistical and policy analysts drawn from Federal statistical agencies that use and produce data on race and ethnicity. They have spent the past year considering these tabulation issues and conducting research to develop tabulation guidelines for constructing ""bridges"" between racial data collected under the new standards and racial data collected under the old standards. The report sets forth criteria by which different bridging methods should be evaluated and describes the different methods that have been considered thus far. The results of the research conducted on several methods for creating bridges are also presented. This part of the report discusses different options for tabulating racial data in order to create bridges from data collected under the 1997 standards, which have five racial categories and permit the reporting of more than one race, back to the data collected under the previous standards, which identified four racial categories. An ""Other"" category appears in much of the analysis, because it is included in the decennial census and some other surveys. All of these methods (and the research on them reported here) involve the use of individual-level records. Analysis is limited to data collected using the separate questions for race and Hispanic origin. Under the new standards, when reporting is based on self-identification, the two-question format is to be used; even in the case of observer identification, this is the preferred format. It is expected that some users will bridge to a distribution created using the combined format for the question on race and ethnicity. Thus, bridging both to the old racial distribution arising from the use of two questions and one based on a combined, single question are analyzed. At this time, the analysis of bridging to the combined distribution has not been completed, but those results will be included in the report when they become available. Based on the research, the strengths and weaknesses of each tabulation method are discussed. Until all the analysis has been completed, however, recommendations will not be made. B. Methods for Bridging The goal of developing bridging methodology for data on race is to identify a statistical model that will take individuals'responses to the new questions on race and classify those responses as closely as possible to the responses we hypothesize they would have given using the old single race categories. Such a task will be relatively easy or be more difficult depending on how an individual identifies himself or herself under the new standards. For bridging purposes, individuals with only a single racial background are likely to identify as they did before, and no statistical model is needed for bridging. However, those with a mixed racial heritage who were previously required to identify only one part of their background may, under the new standards, choose to 62    report more than one racial identity. When a person identifies with more than one racial group, some model will be necessary to translate those multiple responses into the one, single response we hypothesize that the individual most likely would have reported under the old standards. Framework. Several different methods have been identified for creating a single race distribution from data including multiple race responses. These methods vary in both the assumptions that are made and the procedures that are followed. Before describing the particular methods examined in this report, it is useful to describe some of their major underlying characteristics. One major distinction among the methods is whether an individual' responses are assigned to a s single racial category (termed whole assignment) or to multiple categories (termed fractional assignment). Whole assignment can be based on a set of deterministic rules or based on some probabilistic distribution. For example, a deterministic rule might assign all White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, while a probabilistic rule might randomly assign 60 percent of the White and American Indian responses into the American Indian category, and 40 percent into the White category. In the above example, it is unlikely that all individuals identifying as White and American Indian under the new standards would have previously identified as American Indian, so the deterministic rule will result in misclassifications for all those people who had previously identified as White. With a probabilistic rule, an individual' responses s are randomly assigned to either the American Indian category or the White category (such as with 60 percent and 40 percent probabilities, respectively, based on previously collected data). However, even if the overall probabilities matched exactly the aggregate distribution under the old standards, there is no guarantee that the 40 percent who were categorized as White would have classified themselves that way. In fact, in the worst case, all 40 percent who were classified as White would actually have identified as American Indian under the old standards, and a corresponding percentage of those categorized as American Indian would have identified as White. When fractional assignment is used, multiple race responses are categorized into more than one category where each category receives a fraction of a count, and the sum of the fractions equals one. In the above examples of whole assignment, a person' responses were placed into one and s only one category, in an attempt to mimic the past. An alternative is to use a deterministic rule to assign some fraction of the multiple race responses to each of the racial categories identified. For example, a multiple response of White and American Indian might count as ""one-half"" in the tabulations for American Indians and ""one-half"" in the tabulations for Whites. These fractions, like the probabilities in the earlier example, could be varied for different combinations of multiple races to attempt to reflect how often people might identify with one group compared with another. Bridge Tabulation Methods. All of the bridge tabulation methods focus on the assignment of the responses from individuals who identify with more than one racial group. Responses from individuals who identify with only a single racial group under the new standards are assumed to have been the same under the old standards. The response ""Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander"" 63    is assigned to the old racial category of ""Asian or Pacific Islander."" The specific methods for assigning multiple race responses into single race categories are Deterministic Whole Assignment, Deterministic Fractional Assignment, and Probabilistic Whole Assignment. Two sets of results for each of the following tabulation methods are produced. The first set ignores the use of any auxiliary information other than that needed to carry out the particular tabulation method. The other set of results for each method uses the one piece of information that is certain to be common to all data collections done following the new standards, that is, ethnicity. Thus, whether or not an individual is Hispanic is taken into account when a tabulation method is used. (1) Deterministic whole assignment. These methods use fixed, deterministic rules for assigning multiple responses back to one and only one of the racial categories from the old standards. Four alternatives are examined. The first (Smallest Group) assigns responses that include White and another group to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the fewest number of individuals identifying that group as a single race. The second alternative (Largest Group Other Than White) assigns responses that include White with some other racial group, to the other group, but responses with two or more racial groups other than White are assigned into the group with the highest single-race count. The third alternative (Largest Group) assigns responses with two or more racial groups into the group with the largest number of individuals as a single race. In this latter case, any combination with White is assigned to the White category, and combinations that do not include White are assigned to the group with the largest single-race count. The fourth alternative (Plurality) assigns responses based on data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS has permitted respondents to select more than one race for a number of years, with only the first two responses captured. However, respondents reporting more than one race were given a follow-up question asking them to select the one race with which they most closely identify (called Main Race here). For these respondents, the proportion choosing each of the two possibilities as their main race was calculated. All responses in a particular multiple-race category using the Plurality method are assigned to the group with the highest proportion of responses on the follow-up question about main race. (2) Deterministic fractional assignment. These methods use fixed, deterministic rules for fractional weighting of multiple-race responses, that is, assigning a fraction to each one of the individual racial categories that are identified. These fractions must sum to 1. Two alternatives are examined. The first (Deterministic Equal Fractions) assigns each of the multiple responses in equal fractions to each racial group identified. Thus, responses with two racial groups are assigned half to each group; those with three groups are assigned one-third to each, etc. The second alternative (Deterministic NHIS Fractions) assigns responses by fractions to each racial group identified, with the fractions drawn from empirical results from the NHIS (as described above). (3) Probabilistic whole assignment. These methods use probabilistic rules for assigning multiple 64    race responses back to one and only one of the previous racial categories. Two alternatives are examined. These parallel the two alternatives discussed under Deterministic Fractional Assignment, except that, for a given set of fractions, the response is assigned to only one racial category. The fractions specify the probabilities used to select a particular category. The first alternative uses equal selection probabilities. The second uses the NHIS fractions where possible, and equal fractions when no information is available from NHIS. Probabilistic Whole Assignment will yield nearly, on average, the same population counts as Deterministic Fractional Assignment. Only the results from Deterministic Fractional Assignment are presented in this report. In practice, there would be a difference between Deterministic Fractional Assignment and Probabilistic Whole Assignment when computing variances for tabulated estimates, and the two methods will yield relatively small differences in distributions for respondent characteristics. In general, Probabilistic Whole Assignment would yield a higher estimated variance than the Deterministic Fractional approach, with the variances for both methods underestimating the true variance. Probabilistic methods which incorporate a ""Multiple Imputation"" statistical technique would result in an unbiased estimate of variance, but at the price of being more difficult to implement (See Rubin 1987.). (4) All Inclusive. A final tabulation method considered is termed the ""All Inclusive"" method. Under this method all responses are used. Responses are assigned to each of the categories that an individual selects. The sum of the categories totals more than 100 percent. C. Methods of Evaluation Data Sources National Health Interview Survey. The NHIS is a continuing nationwide sample survey designed to measure the health status of residents of the United States (Benson and Marano, 1995; Massey et al., 1989). The analysis here uses data from an analytic file that contains three years of NHIS data (1993, 1994, and 1995). For each of these years there were about 45,000 households interviewed, resulting in slightly more than 100,000 individuals per year. The total sample for the bridge analysis is 323,080 (5237 respondents did not provide data on race). Since 1976, the NHIS has allowed respondents to choose more than one racial category. As the respondent is handed a card with numbered racial categories, the interviewer asks, ""What is the number of the group or groups that represent your race"". If a respondent selects more than one category, the interviewer then asks, ""Which of those groups would you say best describes your race?"" Although the listed racial groups have changed over time, for 1993 to 1995, the card shown to respondents included 16 separate racial categories (white, black, American Indian, Aleut, Eskimo, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Asian Indian, Samoan, Guamanian, and other Asian and Pacific Islander). Although not on the flashcard, respondents were allowed to give an ""other"" race response. To be consistent, the 16 groups were collapsed to the four 65    previous racial categories: White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN), and Asian or Pacific Islander (API), plus Other. For this analysis, a variable called Detailed Race was created from responses to the first question, which allowed identification with more than one racial group. This information is not included on public use data files of the NHIS. However, on internal files, the first two race groups mentioned are recorded for each observation. Even if a respondent selected more than two groups, only two were recorded on the intermediate file. From the two recorded racial responses, Detailed Race was coded into five single race groups (White, Black, AIAN, API, Other) and 11 multiple race groups (White/Black, White/AIAN, White/API, White/Other, Black/AIAN, Black/API, Black/Other, AIAN/API, AIAN/Other, and API/Other). For most analyses, multiple race combinations that had insufficient numbers were aggregated into the category ""Other Combinations."" Individuals who had two racial groups recorded for Detailed Race but a third group recorded for the ""group that best describes race"" were coded into ""Other Combinations."" The Main Race variable, used as a reference point representing the racial distribution under the old standards, is primarily derived from Detailed Race and the responses to the second question, which asks the respondent for the group that best describes his/her race (Benson and Marano, 1995). For respondents who selected one Detailed Race group, Main Race is the same as Detailed Race. For respondents who selected more than one racial group, Main Race is the one group reported as best describing their race. Some respondents who had chosen more than one race for the Detailed Race question responded as ""Multiple race"" or ""Other"" for the Main Race question. For this analysis, these responses were combined into the ""Other"" category. Categories for Main Race were White, Black, AIAN, API, and Other. May 1995 Supplement on Race and Ethnicity to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The May 1995 CPS Supplement was one in a series of studies conducted for the Federal agencies' review of the standards for data on race and ethnicity. The Supplement was designed to address the following issues: (1) the effect of having a ""multiracial"" race category among the list of races; (2) the effect of adding ""Hispanic"" to the list of racial categories; and (3) the preferences for alternative names for racial and ethnic categories (e.g., African-American for Black, and Latino for Hispanic). The Supplement was organized into four panels representing a two-by-two experimental design for studying the first and second issues outlined above. Each panel was given to one-fourth of the sample, or about 15,000 households (30,000 individuals). All respondents in a household received the same set of questions; household members 15 years and older were asked to respond for themselves, and parents answered for children under 15. Only two of the panels in the CPS Supplement permitted respondents to report in a multiracial category (panels 2 and 4), and only one panel had separate race and Hispanic origin questions (panel 2) as ultimately recommended in the new standards. Therefore, panel 2 data were used to analyze the effects of the different tabulation methods for the two-question format. The smaller sample (about 30,000 observations) hampers analysis and generalizations when the focus is on the small portion of the sample (about 1 percent) who identified as ""multiracial."" 66    There are additional limitations to these data for evaluating the bridging methods. The option respondents were given to identify multiple races in the CPS Supplement was a multiracial category with a follow-up question asking respondents to indicate all the racial groups with which they identified. The new standards allow people to identify directly with all the racial groups they choose and do not include a ""multiracial"" category. Furthermore, a large percentage of individuals who chose the multiracial category in panel 2 of the Supplement did not specify more than one racial group (see Tucker et al., 1996). For purposes of this evaluation, individuals were classified as belonging to the specific racial categories they identified. Those who identified as being multiracial but then did not give two or more specific racial groups were reclassified in the one racial category they gave. Thus, the distribution of the CPS Supplement data reported here differs from that which was published in earlier reports, which classified as multiracial any person who identified with the multiracial category even if they only specified one racial group. This new distribution is referred to here as the ""Edited Distribution."" This edited distribution was used with the various tabulation methods. As in NHIS, the resulting distributions were compared to a reference distribution based on the respondents'original answers (in the first CPS interview) to the race question that followed the old standards. 1998 Washington State Population Survey. The 1998 Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) was designed to provide information on Washington residents between decennial censuses. The survey collected data on employment, income, education, and health, along with basic demographic information. The WSPS was done by telephone and included 7,279 households with telephones. Blacks, Asians, Hispanics and American Indians were over sampled. The designated respondent was the individual with the greatest knowledge about the household. The respondent weights reflect this over sampling and, thus, results are representative of the Washington population as a whole. The response rate for the entire sample was between 50 and 60 percent. Information about the race of the respondent was collected twice during the course of the interview. At the beginning of the survey, the respondent was asked, ""Are you of Hispanic origin?"" Following that question, the respondent was asked, ""What is your race?"" The categories were the ones appearing under the old standards, but the order was as follows: Black; American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; Asian or Pacific Islander; and White. An ""Other"" category also was allowed, and the interviewer recorded the verbatim response on a ""specify"" line. Near the end of the survey, the respondent was asked race questions conforming to the new standards. Besides the same Hispanic origin question, the respondent was asked to specify country of origin. For race, the respondent was asked to select one or more categories. This time the ordering of the categories was White; Black or African American (or Haitian or Negro); American Indian or Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Asian. Again, an ""Other"" category was provided. There also was a follow-up question for Asian respondents to specify country of origin. The results from the race question at the end of the survey were used with the tabulation methods. The reference distribution came from the answers to the original race question. 67    Advantages and Disadvantages of These Data Sources Only the Washington State data closely resemble the way the question on race will be asked under the new standards. Yet, all three can offer insights into the relationship between how individuals will actually respond to the new question on race and how they responded to the question under the old standards. The NHIS and the CPS Supplement are nationally representative, and the Washington State data serve as an example for evaluating the tabulation methods at the state level. Simulations using 1990 census data also were conducted, but the results differed little from those for the other data sets. At this point, it is believed that an analysis of data from the 1998 Dress Rehearsal for Census 2000 would be of greater utility. Furthermore, the Dress Rehearsal data will provide examples of the effects of the new standards at the local level. Thus, this analysis will be included in the next version of this report. Description of New Analyses The analyses concentrated on the bridge tabulation methods. These analyses can be divided into three broad areas: (1) descriptions of racial distributions under the alternative bridging tabulation methods; (2) rates of racial ""misclassification"" for these alternatives; and, (3) sensitivity of outcome measures to the bridging alternatives. Distribution of Race. For the first phase of the analysis (using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the data from Washington State), the distributions of race under the allocation alternatives described previously were calculated: All Inclusive, Deterministic Whole Allocation (Smallest Group, Largest Group Other Than White, Largest Group, and Plurality) and Fractional Allocation (Equal Fractions and NHIS Fractions). These new distributions were compared to the reference distribution in each data set. At this time, it is unknown what percentage of people in the United States will identify with more than one racial group when given the opportunity to do so in Census 2000 and in subsequent surveys. For purposes of illustrating the effects of a greater proportion of individuals identifying more than one racial background, analyses were conducted increasing the proportion of multiple race responses two-, four-, six- and eight-fold using the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State micro data sources. The racial distributions were compared using each of the tabulation methods to see effects with increasing levels of reporting more than one race. Of necessity, these tabulations assume that the increases are the same across the different combinations of more than one race. The accuracy of this assumption cannot be tested. The purpose of these analyses is not to attempt to make accurate predictions about the extent of multiple race reporting or its composition, but rather to see more clearly possible differences among tabulation methods that may only become apparent with a greater percentage of more than one race reporting. Misclassification of Race. Besides evaluating the overall racial distributions produced by the tabulation methods, the misclassification of individuals also needs to be examined. For the NHIS, the CPS Supplement, and the Washington State survey, these misclassification rates were formed by comparing an individual' answer to the race question under the old standards to the assigned s 68    category of the individual' response(s) to the race question under the new standards using each s of the tabulation methods. The misclassification rate and its standard error for each race by tabulation method were produced. Preliminary Outcomes Assessment. In the last phase of the analysis, the impact of multiple-race reporting on outcome measures was assessed. This process is important because users in many of the Federal agencies are not typically examining race distributions, but rather trends and indicators for the Nation (e.g., health outcomes, economic well-being, educational attainment) across racial groups. This is where the majority of work will need to be done within individual agencies as the new standards are implemented. An initial examination of how common statistics could be affected by reporting of more than one race was conducted. Five outcome measures were examined, three from the NHIS and two from the CPS Supplement. From the NHIS, three routine health outcomes were calculated: percent of respondents in poor or fair health, percent of children living with a single mother, and percent of respondents with no health insurance. From the CPS Supplement, the proportions of respondents who were unemployed and the labor force participation rates for different racial groups were calculated. These estimates based on the bridging alternatives are not meant to be precise measures of these factors, but are used to demonstrate the possible impact reporting of multiple races and the tabulation methods may have on these and similar estimates. D. Examination of the Results with Respect to the Evaluation Criteria Bridging to the past will be needed for measuring change in a variety of circumstances. Besides measuring population growth, any number of economic, social, and health outcomes must be monitored. This work will involve different population groups at different levels of geography. As a first step toward providing the information users will need to make informed decisions about the methods, the strengths and weaknesses of the bridging methods with respect to the evaluation criteria outlined at the beginning of this report are discussed, based on the results of the statistical analyses conducted. The details of these statistical analyses can be found in Appendix D. Measure Change Over Time. As indicated earlier, measuring change over time is the criterion that is of greatest importance in evaluating the bridging methods. The first and second phases of the analysis shed light on the performance of the various methods in this area. In essence, an ideal bridging method in this case is one that not only accurately recreates the population distribution under the old standards such that the only difference remaining is a function of true change over time, but also assigns an individual' response to the old category that would have been chosen. s The methodology used in these studies allows users, within limits, to see how well the bridging methods using racial data collected under the new standards can match data from the same respondents collected (at about the same time) under the old standards. To the extent that there is a match, any change that would occur from this point forward would indicate true change. If the match is poor, it is not possible to isolate the true change. When comparing the different methods to their reference distributions, the racial categories that 69    were most sensitive to which method is chosen were the numerically small ones, particularly the AIAN category. While different data sets were used in each study and the racial questions were not the same, the studies indicate that the Largest Group Deterministic Whole Assignment method, the Plurality method, and the two Deterministic Fractional Assignment methods produce distributions closer to the reference distributions than do the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method. Controlling for ethnicity had no effect on these results. One reason the Largest Group Assignment method results are so close is that it has little effect on the smaller races, because most assignments are made to Black or White, and the percentages for these two races are so large that the relatively small increase they receive is not noticeable. The Plurality method produces a good fit, because it makes assignments at the level of specific racial combinations. The performance of the NHIS Fractional Assignment method can be discounted to a degree in the NHIS study because the analysis is somewhat circular; however, the results from the CPS Supplement and the Washington State Population Survey (WSPS) show this method yields a relatively close match. The Equal Fractional Assignment method produces a reasonable match in these studies. The primary reason that the other two Whole Assignment methods and the All Inclusive method do not perform as well is that they alter the White percentage to some extent and substantially increase the percentage in the AIAN category. In the case of misclassification rates, some contradictory results emerge. While the AIAN and ""Other"" categories have high misclassification rates across all tabulation methods in the CPS Supplement, the same is not true for the other two surveys. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment methods produce the most comparable results for the AIAN category in both surveys and for the ""Other"" category in the WSPS; however, these methods have higher overall misclassification rates. Both the CPS Supplement and the WSPS have large misclassification rates for these two categories when using many of the tabulation methods. When the distributions of the outcome variables are examined, all methods produce comparable, and relatively close matches for all health outcomes. For the AIAN unemployment rate, the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method appear to produce the least comparable results, but none of the differences are significant. There are significant differences in the AIAN labor force participation rates for several of the tabulation methods. It is likely that which method is best at matching a reference distribution for outcome measures will depend on the outcome being examined. Unfortunately, the data to assess the best tabulation method for each outcome may never be readily available. All of these conclusions should be viewed with caution. Many assumptions had to be made in these studies. It is unclear how people will respond to the new racial question in the future, and these responses could differ by mode of data collection and with the subject of the survey. Furthermore, most of this work on developing bridging methods relied on sample data, and small samples at that. Congruence with Respondent' Choice. This criterion concerns how well the full range of the s 70    respondent' choices is represented in the racial distribution. It is more important for evaluating s ongoing tabulations under the new standards, but the bridging methods can be differentiated with respect to this criterion, too. None of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods take into account the full range of the respondent' selections, but the Plurality method at least controls for s the particular racial combination chosen by the respondent under the new standards. The All Inclusive method accurately reflects all selections by tabulating actual responses and not people. The Equal Fraction Assignment method tabulates people, but, like the All Inclusive method, treats all responses equally. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method takes all responses into account, but assignment is based on attempting to estimate in which single-race category the respondent would prefer to be counted. Range of Applicability. This criterion refers to how well the bridging method can be applied in different contexts. The All Inclusive method provides the same results in every context, because assignment does not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution. This method is not suitable for users who need a distribution that adds to 100 percent. Of the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods, the Largest Group Assignment method is the least sensitive to context and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are as easy to use as the Largest Group Whole Assignment method, but the results for the small racial categories will vary to a greater extent with the context, particularly according to level of geography. The Equal Fraction Assignment method is as generalizable as the All Inclusive method, but it is not quite as easy to use. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method may be the most problematic, because they currently only represent a national preference distribution based on data from 1993 to 1995. The use of this distribution at the local level would be likely to produce inaccurate results in a number of cases. That is not to say that the other methods do not face the same problem. Meet Confidentiality and Reliability Standards. Because these methods all attempt to reproduce the racial categories under the old standards, the same confidentiality problems that existed over the last 20 years will continue to exist. No increase in problems is anticipated. In the case of reliability, however, the situation is different. The All Inclusive method will not produce less reliable data than data produced under the old standards. The Equal Fraction Assignment method may have reliability problems as a result of only adding fractional counts to some of the smaller categories if these categories have a high probability of being chosen as the preferred single race. The same would be true if equal fractions were used to make whole assignments. In sample surveys, the Deterministic Whole Assignment methods will have reliability problems to the extent that there is a large variance on the individual race proportions. This is likely to occur when small samples are involved. The Largest Group Whole assignment method should have the fewest problems with respect to reliability, and the Smallest Group Whole Assignment method will likely have the most. These methods have another problem, however, in that an individual' s response may be assigned to different categories at different levels of geography. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method, as well as methods where fractions are used for whole assignment (i.e., the Plurality method), is based upon a sample distribution with its own variance properties. Reliability for the very small combinations will be quite bad unless many years of data are 71    combined, and this presents its own problems. Minimize Disruptions to the Single Race Distributions. This criterion is only relevant for evaluation of bridging methods. Its purpose is to see how different the resulting bridge distribution is from the single-race distribution for detailed race under the new standards. To the extent that a bridging method can meet the other bridging criteria and still not differ substantially from the single-race proportions in the ongoing distribution, it will have value for looking both forward and backward in time. An evaluation of the different methods according to this criterion involves the comparison of the bridge distributions to the detailed race distribution under the new standards in each case. For the CPS Supplement, the Plurality method is marginally closer than the Largest Group Whole Assignment method and the Fractional methods. While the All Inclusive method and the other Deterministic Whole Assignment methods match for the White category, they differ substantially from the single-race AIAN category in the detailed distribution and are marginally worse for the API category. The NHIS Fractional method is the closest in both the NHIS and WSPS. Statistically Defensible. To be statistically defensible, the bridging method must conform to acceptable statistical conventions. The All Inclusive method makes no assumption about how respondents would assign themselves in the single race situation. The NHIS Fractional Assignment method and the Plurality method are based on an observed distribution, and, to that extent, involve less judgment than the rest of the methods that assign people and not responses. While the Equal Fractional Assignment method is based on judgment, it does not make assumptions about the relative importance of any given race. The Largest Group Whole Assignment method does assign greater importance to one of the races, but it also follows common, but different, statistical practice than the equal fraction approach. Both attempt to minimize the error in assignment. The Smallest Group Whole Assignment method and the Largest Group Other Than White Whole Assignment method do not follow statistical practice, but, instead, rely on the historical record of discrimination; even in these cases, however, the assigned category is based on an observed distribution. Ease of Use. ""Ease of use"" refers to how complicated it is to produce the bridge results. The Equal Fractional Assignment method makes assignments that do not depend on the particular detailed racial distribution at hand. It and the NHIS Fractional Assignment method do require the duplication of individual records or the creation, on every record, of a variable for each racial category under the old standards in order to be able to assign fractions for any combination of categories. If the fractional methods are used to assign a respondent to a single category (whole probabilistic methods), this cumbersome process can be avoided. The All Inclusive method, like the Equal Fractional method, does not depend on the particular distribution, but it does produce proportions that add to more than 100 percent unless they are raked or repercentaged to a base of 100 percent each time. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods and the NHIS Fractional method would require an extra step unless only national figures are used, because the relative size of the groups must be determined for each detailed distribution. Otherwise, they are as easy to 72    use as the whole probabilistic methods. Skill Required. This criterion refers to the skills required to carry out the bridge operations. The amount of computer expertise to perform the operations associated with each of these methods is fairly trivial. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods require almost no statistical knowledge. Some familiarity with the statistical adjustment literature would be useful for understanding the Deterministic Fractional Assignment procedures. If the All Inclusive method were used, users might need to understand statistical raking. Understandability and Communicability. This criterion concerns how easily the methods can be explained and understood by the average user. The Deterministic Whole Assignment methods are both easy to explain and easy to understand. The fractional assignment of individuals to a single category also is not difficult to follow. Assigning fractions of a person to different categories may be easy to explain, but the average user may find it difficult to accept the idea. The All Inclusive method also is easily explained, but, unless the percentages are raked to 100 percent, users may have a problem understanding how to use the results.

The categories in this classification are social-political constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. They are not to be used as determinants of eligibility for participation in any Federal program. The standards have been developed to provide a common language for uniformity and comparability in the collection and use of data on race and ethnicity by Federal agencies. The standards have five categories for data on race: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. There are two categories for data on ethnicity: ""Hispanic or Latino,"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino."" 1. Categories and Definitions The minimum categories for data on race and ethnicity for Federal statistics, program administrative reporting, and civil rights compliance reporting are defined as follows: -American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used in addition to ""Black or African American."" Hispanic or Latino. A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, ""Spanish origin,"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic or Latino."" Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, 74   --  --  --  ---   or North Africa. Respondents shall be offered the option of selecting one or more racial designations. Recommended forms for the instruction accompanying the multiple response question are ""Mark one or more"" and ""Select one or more."" 2. Data Formats The standards provide two formats that may be used for data on race and ethnicity. Self reporting or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. In situations where self-reporting is not practicable or feasible, the combined format may be used. In no case shall the provisions of the standards be construed to limit the collection of data to the categories described above. The collection of greater detail is encouraged; however, any collection that uses more detail shall be organized in such a way that the additional categories can be aggregated into these minimum categories for data on race and ethnicity. With respect to tabulation, the procedures used by Federal agencies shall result in the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as possible. However, Federal agencies shall not present data on detailed categories if doing so would compromise data quality or confidentiality standards. a. Two-question format To provide flexibility and ensure data quality, separate questions shall be used wherever feasible for reporting race and ethnicity. When race and ethnicity are collected separately, ethnicity shall be collected first. If race and ethnicity are collected separately, the minimum designations are: Race: -----Ethnicity: -- Hispanic or Latino -- Not Hispanic or Latino American Indian or Alaska Native  Asian  Black or African American  Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander  White   75    When data on race and ethnicity are collected separately, provision shall be made to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic or Latino. When aggregate data are presented, data producers shall provide the number of respondents who marked (or selected) only one category, separately for each of the five racial categories. In addition to these numbers, data producers are strongly encouraged to provide the detailed distributions, including all possible combinations, of multiple responses to the race question. If data on multiple responses are collapsed, at a minimum the total number of respondents reporting ""more than one race"" shall be made available. b. Combined format The combined format may be used, if necessary, for observer-collected data on race and ethnicity. Both race (including multiple responses) and ethnicity shall be collected when appropriate and feasible, although the selection of one category in the combined format is acceptable. If a combined format is used, there are six minimum categories: ------American Indian or Alaska Native  Asian  Black or African American  Hispanic or Latino  Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander  White   When aggregate data are presented, data producers shall provide the number of respondents who marked (or selected) only one category, separately for each of the six categories. In addition to these numbers, data producers are strongly encouraged to provide the detailed distributions, including all possible combinations, of multiple responses. In cases where data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting ""Hispanic or Latino and one or more races"" and the total number of respondents reporting ""more than one race"" (regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided. 3. Use of the Standards for Record Keeping and Reporting The minimum standard categories shall be used for reporting as follows: a. Statistical reporting These standards shall be used at a minimum for all federally sponsored statistical data collections that include data on race and/or ethnicity, except when the collection involves a sample of such size that the data on the smaller categories would be unreliable, or when the collection effort focuses on a specific racial or ethnic group. Any other variation will have to be specifically authorized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the information 76    collection clearance process. In those cases where the data collection is not subject to the information collection clearance process, a direct request for a variance shall be made to OMB. b. General program administrative and grant reporting These standards shall be used for all Federal administrative reporting or record keeping requirements that include data on race and ethnicity. Agencies that cannot follow these standards must request a variance from OMB. Variances will be considered if the agency can demonstrate that it is not reasonable for the primary reporter to determine racial or ethnic background in terms of the specified categories, that determination of racial or ethnic background is not critical to the administration of the program in question, or that the specific program is directed to only one or a limited number of racial or ethnic groups. c. Civil rights and other compliance reporting These standards shall be used by all Federal agencies in either the separate or combined format for civil rights and other compliance reporting from the public and private sectors and all levels of government. Any variation requiring less detailed data or data which cannot be aggregated into the basic categories must be specifically approved by OMB for executive agencies. More detailed reporting which can be aggregated to the basic categories may be used at the agencies' discretion. 4. Presentation of Data on Race and Ethnicity Displays of statistical, administrative, and compliance data on race and ethnicity shall use the categories listed above. The term ""nonwhite"" is not acceptable for use in the presentation of Federal Government data. It shall not be used in any publication or in the text of any report. In cases where the standard categories are considered inappropriate for presentation of data on particular programs or for particular regional areas, the sponsoring agency may use: a. The designations ""Black or African American and Other Races"" or ""All Other Races"" as collective descriptions of minority races when the most summary distinction between the majority and minority races is appropriate; The designations ""White,"" ""Black or African American,"" and ""All Other Races"" when the distinction among the majority race, the principal minority race, and other races is appropriate; or The designation of a particular minority race or races, and the inclusion of ""Whites"" with ""All Other Races"" when such a collective description is appropriate. In displaying detailed information that represents a combination of race and ethnicity, the 77   b.  c.   description of the data being displayed shall clearly indicate that both bases of classification are being used. When the primary focus of a report is on two or more specific identifiable groups in the population, one or more of which is racial or ethnic, it is acceptable to display data for each of the particular groups separately and to describe data relating to the remainder of the population by an appropriate collective description. 5. Effective Date The provisions of these standards are effective immediately for all new and revised record keeping or reporting requirements that include racial and/or ethnic information. All existing record keeping or reporting requirements shall be made consistent with these standards at the time they are submitted for extension, or not later than January 1, 2003.  78    Appendix B Procedural Implementation of the New Standards for Data on Race and Ethnicity -- Phase I Report An interagency committee was established to develop guidelines that will assist Federal agencies in their implementation of the Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity issued on October 30, 1997. The procedural implementation guidelines address three areas: (1) wording and format of questions that ask for self-reported race and Hispanic or Latino origin; (2) wording and format of instructions and forms that collect aggregate race and Hispanic or Latino origin data; and (3) instructions and training procedures for field interviewers and administrative personnel who will be using these questions and forms. Members of the committee represent the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, and the General Accounting Office. An OMB Clearance Package was approved in March 1998 which authorized the pretesting of different questions and forms. This report describes the study objectives of the three areas, the research design, and the progress to date for Phase I. A second phase will focus on additional issues not resolved in Phase I. Development and Testing of Self-Reported Race and Hispanic or Latino Origin Questions A goal of this research is to provide guidance on the wording and format of self-reported race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions used in a variety of data collection efforts. Following are three of the most significant changes to the ways in which race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions are to be asked by Federal agencies. C Self-report or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. When race and ethnicity are collected separately, ethnicity shall be collected first.  79    C C  Respondents shall be offered the option of selecting one or more racial designations. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander is to be treated as a distinct category from Asian.  The committee' primary objective is to develop and test a series of questions that agencies can s use to guide the design of future data collection instruments. To design the test questions, the committee reviewed current survey practice, prior research on measuring race and ethnicity, and the survey literature on questionnaire design. This led to the identification of three factors which influenced the general design, format, and wording of race and ethnicity test questions. First, questions needed to be as similar as possible to those that were subjected to extensive testing prior to the issuance of the revised standards. In particular, questions used in previous research from the Current Population Survey, the National Content Survey, and the Race and Ethnic Targeted Test (see Federal Register Notice July 1997 for discussion of the results of those tests) were considered. Second, questions needed to be tested in both face-to-face interviews as well as telephone interviews.2 And third, both short and long versions of questions needed to be developed--short in that the question should seek to collect the minimum information specified in the revised standards and long in that the question should collect subgroup information. The minimum level of detail for race questions is the five revised categories--American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Long versions of the race question provide for reporting of subgroups such as Chinese, Japanese, Samoan, and so forth. For Hispanic or Latino origin questions, the minimum level of detail is a Yes or No response indicating Hispanic or Latino origin background. Long versions of the question provide for reporting of subgroups such as Puerto Rican, Cuban, and so forth. At this time, there are no plans to assess comparability of responses across modes; that is, the final report will offer guidelines on ways to ask a question when using a particular mode rather than 2  Mode can also include whether the question administration is done using a computer; at this time, there is no plan for testing computer-administered instruments.  80   provide an analysis of the effects of response distributions when using a particular mode. It will be incumbent upon individual agencies to make final determinations on the exact wording and format of questions and the potential measurement error that may be associated with a given design should be assessed. 1.1 Research Design  Qualitative research using cognitive pretesting methods are being used to test race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. The research plan includes two phases. Phase I is still in progress; most of it has been completed and took place during 1998 in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Eventually, Phase I will include approximately 50 laboratory interviews conducted face-to face or by telephone. Phase II will be similar in scope to Phase I, will begin in 1999, and will be conducted in selected geographic sites outside of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Phase I does not include tests of self-administered race and ethnicity questions since the Census Bureau has already conducted considerable research in preparation for Census 2000. The Census Bureau conducted cognitive research as well as large scale field interviews as part of the Census Bureau' National Content Survey, Race and Ethnicity Targeted Test, and Census 2000 Dress s Rehearsal test. Therefore, the self-administered format options contained in Section 1.3.2 of this report are based mostly on the research accomplished by the Census Bureau. Phase I cognitive testing is conducted as part of a 10-20 minute survey which asks general household information (such as who lives in the household, the age, gender, education level, marital status, and income level of household members) followed by Hispanic or Latino origin and race questions. After the survey is completed, the subject is debriefed by a cognitive interviewer to discuss the meaning of the words and phrases in the race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. Attachment A contains the instrument used for testing. It is important to remember that only a few questions have been selected for testing; other variations of ethnicity and race questions could certainly have been tested and may, in fact, work 81    just as well or better in a particular survey. For example, all of the Hispanic or Latino origin test questions include the word Spanish in the question; that is, the test question asks Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino? rather than Are you Hispanic or Latino? It is relevant, then, to note that the options on the following pages reflect what worked well among the different questions tested, not what is the best way to ask a race or Hispanic or Latino origin question. Phase I test results and the examples presented should not imply limitations or constraints to other question designs that comply with the revised standards. The research design for Phase I has been modified over the past six months and currently has six experimental conditions. Two conditions test the questions by telephone and four conditions test the questions face-to-face. Optimally, each test condition will include at least 8 subjects, 1 whose parents are both American Indian or Alaska Native, 1 whose parents are both Asian, 1 whose parents are both Black or African American, 1 whose parents are both Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 1 whose parents are both White, 1 whose parents are both Hispanic or Latino (regardless of race), and 2 whose parents are different races (regardless of the particular race combinations).3 Participants are recruited mostly by newspaper advertisements and flyers. Some additional recruitment efforts may be directed at community centers or other organizations in order to reach individuals who are Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, and individuals who are more than one race. Subjects are paid $25 for one hour, and interviews are audio-taped or video-taped, depending on the interview site. Attachment C shows the progress to date by test condition. 1.2 Results  Thirty-two cognitive interviews (25 face-to-face and 7 telephone) have been completed.  Participants are not asked to report their race or ethnicity during the telephone screening interview. Rather, they are asked to report the race and ethnicity of their mother and their father, along with a few other demographic questions about each of their parents. The reported race of their parents are used to assign subjects to a particular test condition. Also, it is compared with the race(s) individuals report themselves to be in order to provide further information on the process of self-identification of race and Hispanic or Latino origin.  3  82   Generally, subjects were able to provide answers to both long and short versions of race and Hispanic or Latino origin questions. As expected, subjects who were interviewed face-to-face seemed to use and rely on the flashcards to select a response. Subjects interviewed by telephone had a bit more difficulty answering the race questions since they had to listen to a relatively long list of response options. 1.2.1 Testing Hispanic or Latino Origin Questions Two subjects answered ""Yes"" to the Hispanic or Latino origin question and 30 answered ""No."" During debriefings, all subjects were asked their impressions of the other Hispanic or Latino test questions and were shown various versions of the Hispanic or Latino flashcard. Subjects were generally familiar with Hispanic or Latino origin questions, regardless of the particular test condition. As found in previous research, subjects define Hispanic and Latino differently but they are comfortable with both terms used in the same question. Since the test questions also included the term Spanish (which is allowed by the revised standards), subjects were asked their opinion about including the word Spanish; most stated they thought that the word Spanish was important to include. Subjects commonly defined Hispanic as indicating geographic location or Spanish origin, Spanish as indicating European origin or coming from the country of Spain, and Latino as a cultural concept associated with Latin American cooking, dress, and language. Face-to-face interviews: All of the 25 subjects interviewed face-to-face seemed to find the Hispanic or Latino origin flashcards useful. Two flashcard versions were tested; Flashcard 7A and Flashcard 7B each list the detailed Hispanic or Latino origin subgroups but in different ways. When shown both flashcards, subjects preferred Flashcard 7A which lists the subgroups under the main category ""Yes, Spanish, Hispanic, Latino.""  83    Flashcard 7A No Yes Not Spanish, Hispanic, Latino Spanish, Hispanic, Latino Includes Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or other Spanish, Hispanic, Latino  Flashcard 7B No Yes Not Spanish, Hispanic, Latino Spanish, Hispanic, Latino Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano  Puerto Rican  Cuban  Other Spanish, Hispanic, Latino   Telephone interviews: For the 7 subjects interviewed by telephone, 4 were asked a short Hispanic or Latino question and 3 were asked a long version, both shown below.  Short  Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino?  Long  Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino? If Yes and no further information is provided, ask Which one of the following are you? Are you Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or of another Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino group? 84   Regardless of version, all of the telephone subjects were able to answer the first part of the question without difficulty. The second part of the long version has not been tested with enough Hispanic or Latino subjects, since one needs to answer ""Yes"" to the first part in order to test the second part. However, interviewers expressed concern that the long version may present some response problems since respondents will have to recall six possible categories without use of a flashcard or other visual aid. 1.2.2 Testing Race Questions Among the 32 subjects interviewed, 13 reported their race as Black, 3 reported Asian, 2 reported Native Hawaiian, 4 reported more than one race, and 10 reported White, of which 2 also reported Hispanic or Latino origin. No American Indians or Alaska Natives were interviewed in Phase I. Two of the 4 subjects who reported more than one race for themselves reported their parents as both being the same race. These two subjects based their multiple race reports on the backgrounds of grandparents or great-grandparents which is consistent with prior research. Of the four subjects who reported more than one race, three reported combinations of Native Hawaiian, White, and either Japanese and/or Chinese.4 The fourth subject to report more than one race replied White and Asian. Face-to-face interviews: Subjects who were interviewed face-to-face heard the question read and were handed a flashcard containing the response options. Several subjects indicated initial surprise at not seeing a Hispanic or Latino category or its equivalent. For example, one subject said ""Given the choices here, I don' see what I should put down. I guess I have to say White, t but that' not right."" When asked the meaning of certain race terms, some subjects referred to s geographic origin, some mentioned facial or skin color characteristics, and others mentioned a particular culture or heritage. Several subjects were specially recruited through a Native Hawaiian source which accounts for the frequency of Native Hawaiian responses. 85 4   Among the three flashcards tested, subjects preferred Flashcard 9 or Flashcard 10 (see below). In one case, a Filipino subject responded differently depending on the flashcard used. She was first shown a long version (Flashcard 10) and responded ""Filipino, I guess under Asian."" In the debriefing, she was then shown a short version (Flashcard 9) and again was asked her race. She responded ""Other Pacific Islander because the Philippines are a Pacific Island. So I guess my answer would be different depending on the list used."" Flashcard 9 White  Black or African American  American Indian or Alaska Native  Asian  Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander   Flashcard 10 White  Black or African American  American Indian or Alaska Native  Asian  Asian Indian Japanese Chinese Korean Filipino Vietnamese Other Asian Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Native Hawaiian  Guamanian or Chamorro  Samoan  Other Pacific Islander    Telephone interviews: Subjects interviewed by telephone were only asked a short version of the race question as shown below.  86    Short  I' going to read a list of racial categories. Please select one or m more to best describe your race. Are you White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander?  There was some indication that hearing a list with alternative terms representing one category (i.e., Black or African American is one category, not two) may result in confusion. Specifically, two subjects thought the interviewer asked them to choose between Black or African American and commented that they did not like having to make a choice. This problem can be addressed through interviewer training that teaches the interviewer to pause longer after saying each category term or phrase; that is, if the interviewer is reading a list of ""...White, Black or African American, Asian, ..."" she/he should pause between the words White and Black, not pause between Black or African American, and pause again between African American and Asian. This should help the telephone respondent hear that Black or African American is one choice, not two. There was some evidence that the instruction to ""...select one or more..."" was misunderstood on the telephone to mean that the subject had to select more than one race. Interviewers will need to be trained to perceive and correct for this. 1.2.3 Concepts of Race and Ethnicity As has been noted elsewhere in the literature, respondents often do not make clear distinctions between the terms used in describing race, ethnicity, nationality, and ancestry. In the cognitive interviews, understanding of the intent of a race or Hispanic origin question was shared but individual differences in the interpretation and meaning of terms used was found, as was confusion regarding the separation of Hispanic or Latino origin from race. The following examples from the cognitive interviews illustrate these findings. C It means ethnic background. Not the country. I think people tend to cross quickly between using the terms race and country. When I say ""Yes, I am Hawaiian"" I mean that in my bloodstream I have Hawaii. My blood inheritance.  87    C C C C  Race I guess means the color somebody is. Or, their cultural heritage. The word race means the biological heritage from which you descend. Race means the culture that someone is from. The way I think of race, I think of it as a negative, probably because of what we' ve read about in the 60's--race riots, etc. It always seems to have a negative connotation. I prefer to use ethnicity. I answer differently sometimes, depending on what' beneficial to my family or me. s Sometimes you see Hispanic as a choice for race. If Hispanic had been offered as a race then I would have chosen that. The race question is difficult because it doesn' have enough categories, it' too t s restrictive. With only five categories, there are two that are too specific-American Indian and Native Hawaiian--and there' a list of countries for the s Asians. It doesn' specify anything about Central or South American descent. t Everybody comes from different backgrounds; even White Americans can probably check off Irish, etc. Guidelines for the Design of Race and Ethnicity Questions  C C C  1.3  As has been discussed earlier in this chapter, the Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity issued on October 30, 1997 set forth principles that should be followed when collecting race and ethnicity data for Federal reporting purposes. These principles and the guidelines below should serve to assist in the design and format of race and ethnicity questions contained in Federal data collection instruments. In addition, there is a rich literature on questionnaire design and data collection methods as well as the measurement of race and ethnicity. Readers are strongly encouraged to consult the literature and are referred to a suggested reference list contained at the end of this chapter. By no means comprehensive, this list should provide at least a starting point for those seeking further guidance. Following the guidelines below are examples of questions to illustrate specific formats and wording depending on the mode of data collection.  88    Guideline 1: Communicate clearly an instruction that allows multiple responses to the race question. The revised standards are clear that the format and wording used in a race question must communicate to the respondent an instruction that multiple responses are acceptable. Based on research findings, the recommended forms for this instruction are Mark one or more or Select one or more. The committee supports these recommendations but recognizes that other possible instructions may be preferred, especially when integrating a race question within an existing data collection instrument. For example, some mail instruments do not word questions in a personal way; that is, rather than What is your age? an instrument may simply have Age with a line for an entry. Taking this case further, if one has an item simply worded as Race with a line for an entry, then an instruction must be included to communicate that multiple race responses are acceptable. Variations could include Race - enter one or more. Regardless of exact wording, the instruction must be evident to the respondent. Guideline 2: Consider using an instruction to answer both the Hispanic or Latino question and the race question. This has particular relevance for mail surveys or questionnaires that are self administered since there is no interviewer interaction. An instruction such as the following may improve potential item non-response, especially among Hispanic respondents. NOTE: Please answer BOTH Questions 1 and 2 (Hispanic or Latino and Race)5 Guideline 3: For data collection efforts requiring detailed Hispanic or Latino origin or race information, consider options to collect further information through write-in entries or follow-up questions asked by the interviewer. Write-in entries or follow-up questions would be most commonly used for ` other'responses such as Other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino, Other Pacific Islander, or Other Asian. Also, write-in or follow-up information may be desired to obtain the name of the enrolled or principles tribe for American Indian or Alaska Native responses. Questions shown in section 1.3.2 includes examples for write-in responses.  5  Modified version as shown in the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal forms 89   Guideline 4: Take mode carefully into account when designing questions and instructions.  This  guideline may seem obvious but it is often the case that surveys are conducted using a mixed mode (i.e., the initial interview attempt may be personal visit but a telephone interview is permissible). Since the questions should be designed with the mode in mind, there may need to be different versions of questions, depending on the mode of administration. Below is a brief discussion of some additional issues to consider depending on mode. For surveys conducted face-to-face by an interviewer, use of a flashcard is very helpful to the respondent. The wording of the question has to incorporate the instruction to look at the flashcard. Further, the design of the flashcard is important; it should clearly and neatly contain all available response categories. Similarly, the design, layout, and visual appearance of a self-administered questionnaire is very important and should be carefully considered. For telephone surveys, questions generally are shorter with fewer response categories. This presents a problem with questions that need to collect detailed information (see Guideline 3 discussed above). One solution may be to allow a follow-up question similar to the example shown in Section 1.3.4 that was tested to collect detailed Hispanic or Latino information. Using the race question as another example, if the respondent is read, Please select one or more to best describe your race. Are you White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander? and responds I am Asian, a follow-up question such as Which one of the following are you? Are you Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or from another Asian group? could be asked. Guideline 5: Provide definitions to the minimum race categories when possible. This guideline is particularly relevant when the short version (only the five minimum categories) of a race question is used. Individual interpretation of the five categories could lead to response error, especially for respondents unsure of the definitions of Asian and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. For self-administered forms, providing the definition of the category should be considered if space and formatting limitations can be overcome. For interviewer-administered questions, the definitions  90    should be readily available to the interviewer (usually in a manual that provides question-by question specifications) to assist the respondent if needed. Guideline 6: Adhere to the specific terminology as stated in the October 30, 1997 revised standards. The revised standards address the words and terms to use, and also indicates other terms that can be considered. For example, the name of the Black category should be Black or African American and additional terms such as Haitian or Negro can be used if desired. In another example, American Indian should be used and Native American should not be substituted for American Indian. Reviewing the terms specified in the revised standards is strongly encouraged before designing questions on race and Hispanic or Latino origin.  1.3.2 Examples of Hispanic or Latino Origin and Race Test Questions -Self-Administration6 Are you Spanish/Hispanic/Latino? 9 9 Yes No  Are you Spanish/Hispanic/Latino?

Phase II research will begin in Spring 1999 and conclude by July 31, 1999. Phase II will follow the same research design as Phase I but will be expanded geographically and will focus on testing with individuals who are Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and individuals with multiple racial heritage. In addition to research conducted by the committee, other studies could be initiated by agencies or interested groups. The committee expects to continue the review and modification of these guidelines as implementation occurs, feedback from agencies is received, and new research findings become available.  2.  Development and Testing of Aggregate Reporting Forms  A second goal of this research is to provide guidance on the design of reporting forms that will be used by administrative personnel to aggregate race and Hispanic or Latino origin data for a given population (e.g., reporting race and ethnicity for a school population, a jail population, etc). Implementing the revised standards will cause some fundamental changes to the ways in which race and Hispanic or Latino origin data have previously been aggregated and reported. In the past, agencies were required to report, at a minimum, the number of individuals who marked one of the four race categories, as well as the number of individuals who reported either Hispanic or Latino origin or not of Hispanic or Latino origin. A standard or prototype reporting form was not provided to Federal agencies. Rather, agencies developed their own forms depending on the characteristics of a given program and the data collection effort. The October 30, 1997 revised standards specify that, at a minimum, the number of individuals who marked one of the five race categories and the number who marked more than one race category are to be reported and that the race of those indicating Hispanic or Latino origin be reported if available. In many cases, greater detail about the combinations of specific multiple race responses 96    will be needed. The following are some of the decisions issued in the revised standards that impact the design of aggregate reporting forms. C When self-identification is not feasible or appropriate, a combined question can be used and should include a separate Hispanic or Latino category co-equal with the other categories. C When the combined format is used, an attempt should be made to record ethnicity and race but the option to indicate only one category (i.e., Hispanic or Latino, with no race designation) is acceptable. C When data are collected in a combined format and data on multiple responses are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting ` Hispanic or Latino and one or more races'and the total number of respondents reporting ` more than one race'(regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided. C When data on race and ethnicity are collected separately, provision shall be made to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic or Latino. C In addition to providing the number of people who marked one of the five racial categories, data producers are strongly encouraged to provide the detailed distributions of multiple responses. At a minimum, the total number of respondents reporting ` more than one race' shall be made available. The committee' goal is to test different forms in order to offer guidelines to Federal agencies. s These guidelines should serve as a reference tool for agencies as they develop their own version of aggregate reporting forms based on agency data needs and program characteristics.  97    2.1  Research Design  The development of test forms has been a collaborative effort among the committee members, experts in questionnaire design and survey research, and policy and statistical analysts from the federal government who have been involved in the revision of standards for race and ethnicity data. In developing test forms, a decision was made to only use the minimum race categories specified in the revised standards. Thus, the forms only aggregate the numbers of American Indians or Alaska Natives, Asians, Blacks or African Americans, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, and Whites and do not aggregate subgroups such as Chinese, Japanese, Samoan, and so forth. However, any form could easily be extended in order to capture other subgroup data, and it is expected that agencies will develop forms that meet their specific data needs. Phase I is still in progress. Twenty cognitive interviews, 10 in cognitive laboratories and 10 on-site at establishments and agencies, are planned for this phase of the research. To test the forms, the subjects need to be familiar with reporting aggregate data for a given population (e.g., total numbers of students by demographic characteristics) but not necessarily familiar with the revised standards. For Phase I, participants are recruited mostly through committee contacts with representatives in various Federal, state and local agencies as well as those in the private sector. Three different forms have been developed for testing purposes. The committee recognized from the outset that many organizations collect and maintain data at the individual level that includes Hispanic or Latino co-equal with other race categories. However, the design of the forms was an attempt to see how subjects would approach the task of aggregating separate Hispanic or Latino counts with the expectation that in the future, agencies will gradually modify the ways in which individual race and Hispanic or Latino origin data are collected. A brief description of each form follows.  98    C  Form RH-1 is designed to collect the specific reports of race and record these by the Hispanic or Latino origin responses. There are 31 reporting lines representing every combination of both single and multiple race responses for the five minimum race categories. Total numbers for each race group are then entered under one of three Hispanic or Latino origin status columns: Yes, of Hispanic or Latino origin; No, not of Hispanic or Latino origin; No Hispanic or Latino origin information provided. This form conceptualizes what an automated data collection format would include. It can easily be expanded or reduced depending on the specific race combinations listed.  C  Form RH-2 has two parts. First, it asks for the aggregate number of individuals who reported each single race, the number of individuals who reported more than one race, and the number of individuals for whom race information is missing. Second, for records of individuals who reported more than one race, the form then asks for a count of the number of times each race was included in a multiple race response. These numbers are reported in one of three columns: Hispanic or Latinos, non-Hispanic or Latinos, or separate Hispanic or Latino origin question but with no answer given.  C  Form RH-3 has two parts and is similar conceptually to RH-2. However, it is designed to report aggregated race data crosstabulated with other variables. RH-3A asks for the aggregate number of individuals who reported each single race and the aggregate number of individuals who reported more than one race crosstabulated by Hispanic or Latino origin and gender. RH-3B is completed only for records reporting more than one race. The number of times each race was indicated is then crosstabulated by Hispanic or Latino origin and gender.  2.2  Results  Expert panel: A panel comprised of questionnaire design specialists and experts well-versed in aggregate reporting by establishments was convened in July 1998 to discuss draft forms for testing. Results indicated that the test forms were too complicated and should be redesigned so that they 99    would be easy to complete with little or no instructions. There were many reformatting suggestions, such as trying to follow the step-by-step narrative approach used by Internal Revenue Service tax forms that guide a respondent in calculating and entering a numeric report. Also, several of the experts thought that a reporting form should be developed that allowed for the aggregation of Hispanic or Latino origin individuals co-equal with individuals reporting race information; this suggestion was based on the knowledge that current practice among many institutions is to collect individual race and ethnicity data using a combined format. The feedback from the expert panel led to three significant changes in the test forms. First, one form was redesigned to allow for the aggregate reporting of every combination of multiple race responses (among the five minimum race categories). A second form was redesigned to capture single race responses, the total count of multiple race responses, and the number of times a racial group was reported within multiple race combinations. Using Asian reports as an example, the second form was designed to aggregate the total number of students who reported only Asian and the total number of students who reported Asian plus one or more other races. Third, a form was redesigned to provide a template for crosstabulating race reports with other demographic data. Cognitive interviews: Fourteen interviews have been accomplished thus far, 7 in cognitive laboratories and 7 on-site. Of the 14 respondents interviewed, 5 were Federal government personnel, 6 worked in private industry, 2 worked in local correctional facilities, and 1 worked in a school. For the laboratory testing, subjects were given ` dummy'records of applications that contained multiple race responses as well as combined Hispanic or Latino origin and race questions. Dummy records were used in order to see how subjects would complete the forms based on different kinds of source data. Examples of the questions used in the dummy records are below followed by the results of testing each of the three forms. For testing conducted on-site, actual agency records were used. Attachment B contains the general interview protocol. Attachment D shows the progress to date by test condition.  100    Example 1 - Combined format used on dummy records Race: Mark one or more 01 9 White 02 9 Black or African American 03 9 Hispanic or Latino 04 9 American Indian or Alaska Native  05 9 Asian  06 9 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander   Example 2 - Two question format used on dummy records 9.

Race: 01 9 02 9 03 9 04 9 05 9 Mark one or more White Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander  2.2.1 Form RH-1 This form has been tested with four subjects. There were no appreciable differences between the laboratory and on-site interviews other than the fact that the agency data used on-site was substantially different than the data elements for Form RH-1. While Form RH-1 is the easiest of the three forms to complete, the subjects demonstrated some difficulty grasping the concept of multiple race responses and said the form appeared complex when they first looked at it. Several subjects stated that a separate set of instructions on how to complete the form is needed. One subject reviewed the form and did not think it provided all the needed reporting categories because Hispanic was not listed as a race. Even though the subject noticed that there was an individual column for Hispanic individuals to be reported, he was confused because Hispanic was not listed among the rows with the other race groups. 101   Once subjects began to complete the form, they were able to adapt to its format and report numbers accurately in the correct rows. However, entering the correct number in the appropriate Hispanic column remained a problem. One subject stated ""Everything was pretty straightforward and I really didn' have any difficulty filling out my employees...but why are there three Hispanic t columns? Why is the focus there? It seems sort of arbitrary."" In particular, subjects seemed to have the most difficulty knowing where to report Hispanic individuals with no race information.  RH-1 form and instructions will be revised prior to further testing. The revised form will only have two Hispanic columns (Yes, of Hispanic or Latino origin; No, not of Hispanic or Latino origin) because subjects had a lot of difficulty discriminating between the column Individuals who marked NO, Hispanic origin and the column Individuals who did not provide Hispanic origin information.7 The revised RH-1 will also attempt to make clearer where to record individuals for whom no race information is available. Last, an improved set of instructions will be developed and tested. Following is a sample of part of the form that was tested followed by the test instructions.  RH-1 as well as RH-2 and RH-3 used Hispanic origin rather than Hispanic or Latino origin. This was an oversight that will be corrected in future testing. 102  7   FORM RH-1  Individuals who marked YES, Hispanic Origin 1 White 2 Black/African American 3 Asian 4 American Indian/Alaska Native 5 Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander 6 White + Black/African Am. 7 White + Asian 8 White + Am Indian/Alaska Nat.  Individuals who marked NO, Hispanic Origin  Individuals who did NOT provide Hispanic Origin information  Individuals who marked ONLY ONE race  Individuals who marked TWO races  9 White + Nat Hawaiian/OPI 10 Black/African Am + Asian 11 Black/African Am + Am Indian/Alaska 12 Black/African Am + Nat Hawaiian/OPI 13 Asian + Am Indian/Alaska Nat. 14 Asian + Nat Hawaiian/OPI  Race missing Total  32 Individuals who DID NOT provide race information 33 Total population Sum of rows 1 through 32  NOTE: Form RH-1 contains rows 15-31 which are rows for individuals who marked three, four, and five race groups. For space reasons, only the first third of the form is shown above.  103    RH-1 INSTRUCTIONS When completing this form, please note: 1. 2. 3. We are requesting separate counts for individuals who mark only one race and for those who mark more than one race-- one race, two races, three races, etc. For the purposes of this form, 'Hispanic' is an ethnic group and is not a race. If you are entering information for individuals of Hispanic origin for whom no race data are available, please enter these individuals in your count on Line 32, 'Individuals who DID NOT provide race information' and Column (1) 'Individuals who marked YES, Hispanic origin'. If you do not have any racial/ethnic information for individuals, or the information your organization has does not fit a racial/ethnic category, then please enter these individuals in your count in Row 32 'Individuals who DID NOT provide race information' and Column (3) 'Individuals who did not provide Hispanic Origin information'.  4.  2.2.2 Form RH-2 Form RH-2 has been tested with eight subjects and has undergone several revisions. As found in Form RH-1, participants interviewed on-site as well as the laboratory subjects using a combined race/ethnicity dummy record were the most confused because the test form separates counts of Hispanics from counts of race groups which is not currently done at their agency or organization. With one exception, the subjects interviewed both in the laboratory and on-site were not experienced in manually aggregating data from individual source documents. Rather, they were familiar working with data already aggregated and contained in automated files, most of which include Hispanic as one of the race/ethnicity reporting categories. For example, one subject stated ""The only one I got confused and stumped on was ....under the multi-race count... It was hard for me not to treat Hispanic as a race category. I guess I' been trained and indoctrinated."" A ve second subject said ""It' basically asking how Hispanics were separated into groups of races. I s think the part that confuses me is that our Hispanics do not view themselves as another race. And 104    so that is kind of what threw me off... it' asking for Hispanics who had marked ` s White,'but they don' They would have checked Hispanic."" t. Whether in the laboratory or on-site, all subjects were confused at first by the second half of the form which requires the reporting of the number of times a race was marked among the multiple race responses. Below is a modified portion of the form that asks for these counts. As indicated in the RH-1 discussion, Form RH-2 will be revised prior to further testing.  FORM RH-2  REPORTING MULTIPLE RACES  Count of TIMES each race was marked for individuals who marked MORE THAN 1 race Number of times WHITE was marked  Hispanics  NON Hispanics  Separate Hispanic Origin Question with no answer given  Number of times BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN was marked  Number of times ASIAN was marked  Number of times AMERICAN INDIAN/ ALASKA NATIVE was marked Number of times NATIVE HAWAIIAN / OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER was marked  105    2.2.3 Form RH-3 Two interviews were completed with Form RH-3. Neither subject completed the form accurately or seemed to understand its intent. This form allows for race information to be crosstabulated by other demographic information. The top portion of the form is shown below. The two subjects interviewed only had experience working with automated data and therefore, had no experience or knowledge of the tasks involved in manually aggregating responses. One subject, a Federal government EEO officer, stated that Hispanic is considered a race and she demonstrated difficulty in not knowing where to report Hispanic individuals as well as what to do for Hispanic or Latino individuals who also mark one race (Should I count this as a multiple race count?). The other subject did not understand the form at all and was only familiar with producing aggregate reports from automated data systems. Form RH-3 needs some additional testing before revisions can be made.  FORM RH-3A  AGGREGATE REPORTING OF POPULATION BY RACE, HISPANIC ORIGIN AND GENDER  Hispanic and Gender Characteristics  Individuals Who Marked Only ONE Race White Black/ African American Asian American Indian/ Alaska Native Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific  Individuals Who Marked MORE THAN ONE Race  Individuals Who Did NOT Report Race  Total Pop  Total Population Hispanic Male Female Total Not Hispanic Male Female Total No Hispanic Information Male Female Total  106    2.3  Methodological Problems  Based on the laboratory interviews, on-site visits, and discussions with many state and local government personnel and personnel working in private industry, several methodological problems regarding the development and testing of aggregate reporting forms were identified. Differences between the format of the individual (source) data and the format of the aggregate form: One of the problems in trying to test a prototype form that would assist agencies in developing aggregate reporting methods is that the format of the individual data varies across programs, agencies, and organizations. To develop an aggregate reporting form, general questionnaire design principles would call for using the same or similar categories as those used for the individual data. For example, if the individual data uses a combined race/ethnicity question in which Hispanic or Latino is one of the response options, then one would expect to design an aggregate form that follows the source data convention. Through interviews and discussions with a variety of data reporters, members of the committee found that a combined race/ethnicity question has been used often and that a variety of terms and words are used to represent a race category. Thus, subjects have difficulty complying with the testing task because they are essentially being asked to reformat and redefine their data in order to complete the test form. Regardless of whether an agency is using a combined question or whether an agency is using the terms set forth in the revised standards, the point here is that data reporters expect an aggregate form to be similar conceptually to individual records. Since the test forms were developed independent of what the individual records contain, the test forms were perceived as unsuitable for reporting agency race and ethnicity data. To illustrate this problem, at one corrections center, the racial identification is made by the arresting officer and includes the categories: (1) Black, (2) White, (3) Oriental, (4) Indian, (5) Black Hispanic, (6) White Hispanic, (7) Oriental Hispanic, (8) Indian Hispanic, and (9) unknown. The information is made by observation, and it is unclear to what extent Hispanic information is assessed accurately. At a different corrections center in the same state, race and ethnicity data are automated 107    and keyed using two separate fields as follows: (B) Black, (A) Asian/Pacific Islander/Oriental, (I)  American Indian/Alaska Native, (C) Caucasian, and (U) Unknown; in a separate field either (H)  Hispanic is entered or the field is left blank. The data are obtained from a police officer who records  it on an intake form which is then keyed at the time of entrance to the facility. The database at this  facility allows for missing/unknown race information which the subject said accounts for roughly  10% of the facility population.   Neither one of these subjects worked easily with the test form because it was so different from their  agency' individual source data and aggregate reports they have completed in the past.   s Difficulties in performing a complicated manual task. A second testing problem was that only one  subject was familiar with manual aggregating and reporting of race and ethnicity data. One of the  committee' underlying assumptions was that if manual reporting forms were developed and tested,  s they could then easily be adapted to automated reporters. While this may be true, the testing  process itself was strained because the individuals interviewed had considerable difficulty applying  their data reporting process to manual completion of the test forms. Improving the instructions will  partially reduce this problem but redesigning the forms is necessary too.  Visual appearance of the forms: The committee recognized that the forms look complicated. While  it was thought that draft forms would suffice for testing purposes, the importance of the appearance  and layout of the forms were underestimated. Prior to further testing, the forms will be redesigned  to look more professional and reduce the initial perception of complexity.   Mix of laboratory and on-site tests: Conducting both laboratory and on-site visits is  methodologically much more complicated than had been foreseen. Simply put, testing in the  laboratory using dummy records is not similar enough to a like task at an agency level. This is  because the laboratory subjects actually performed the task of categorizing and manually  aggregating data in order to fill out the test form. On-site, however, the data the subjects worked  with for testing were already aggregated and therefore, the task was substantially different and  subjects could not simply disaggregate the data as needed to fill out the form. This problem can be  partially remedied by developing different protocols for laboratory and on-site tests as well as  108    ensuring that the interview is conducted with a staff member who has access to the individual source data. 2.4 Guidelines for Aggregate Reporting of Race and Ethnicity Data  As referred to previously, the Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity issued on October 30, 1997 set forth principles that should be followed when aggregating race and ethnicity data for Federal reporting purposes. The committee tested three different reporting forms with the hopes of providing guidelines to agencies for the development of new reporting forms. None of the three forms as tested are recommended for use. However, results of the fourteen interviews suggest that minor revisions and improved formatting of Form RH-1 may work for agencies that collect each multiple race combination reported. The Phase II revision of Form RH-1, along with improved instructions, may also serve to help develop computer specifications for those who will be developing automated reporting systems. For agencies that need a total number of multiple race responses followed by the number of times each race was reported, the concepts underlying Forms RH-2 and RH-3 will provide the data needed and may be worth pursuing. However, the current forms need substantial revision and, more importantly, considerable attention still needs to be paid to developing instructions that are easy to understand and will lead to accurate completion of the forms. A remaining problem that can only be overcome in time is the need for agencies to change the way individual data are collected. Redesign of the forms will not address the disconnect between the format of the individual data and the format of aggregate forms that meet the revised standards. A few general guidelines, though, can be offered at this point and should be considered by agencies as they move forward with implementing the revised standards.  109    Guideline 1: If possible, allow for the reporting of every combination of multiple race responses. A system that collects every multiple race combination along with Hispanic or Latino origin information will allow the maximum flexibility for an agency in further reporting and analysis. It would be expected that only automated systems could achieve this, unless the population sizes for a given agency or organization are small enough to allow manual record keeping and tabulations. Most of interviews thus far confirmed that for agencies that automate individual records, new combinations of multiple races could be incorporated into their current systems.8 Practically, though, modifying a reporting system to accept numerous combinations of race and ethnicity reports has several difficulties, most notably (1) the burden associated with reporting at least 62 issue of data suppression due to confidentiality and privacy concerns. Guideline 2: Professionally design the form and include clear instructions.   Taking care to professionally design a reporting form may seem obvious but the need for this is  heightened when the form is complex and appears difficult to complete. Many future respondents  reporting race and ethnicity data will be working with new terms and concepts and therefore, may  be more prone to error if instructions are not clear and completion of forms are not self-evident. In  particular, instructions must address what the reporter should do if the individual data has been  collected using a combined format.  Guideline 3: Provide definitions that assist in understanding the concepts of single race reports and multiple race reports as well as the distinction between ethnicity and race. These definitions might be able to be integrated into the instructions accompanying the form or on the form itself. Another option is to develop an information sheet that explains these and other relevant definitions. 9  unique combinations of race and Hispanic or Latino origin crossed by other variables and (2) the  Contacts at establishments have stated that the costs of modifying their current automated systems may be high and that accommodating a reporting change would require a decision at senior management levels. The figure of 62 is based upon the possible combinations of 5 race categories and 2 ethnicity categories (Yes or No regarding Hispanic or Latino origin). The figure could be substantially higher if subgroups (e.g., Japanese, Samoan, Cuban, Puerto Rican, etc.) are used when collecting race and ethnicity data as well as combinations that account for missing race data and missing Hispanic or Latino origin data. 9  8  110   Guideline 4: Explain how the respondent should treat different kinds of missing data. One clear problem that emerged in the cognitive testing was that respondents were unsure how to handle missing data. Missing data can take a variety of forms (i.e, Hispanic is reported but race data is missing; race is reported but Hispanic information is missing) and each type should be addressed to avoid reporting errors. 2.5 Continuing Research on Aggregate Reporting of Race and Ethnicity  Phase I will be completed by April 1, 1999. Phase II will begin in the Spring 1999 and be completed by July 31, 1999. Its research design is currently being revised and may include further testing and refinement of forms and instructions. It may also include a more focused effort to conduct on-site visits with various agencies to better understand the reporting problems posed by aggregate reporting of race and ethnicity data. It is relevant to note that many of the problems identified in this research are not new and have been known and documented in the past. Phase II will concentrate on developing guidelines that will inform the reporting process, improve data quality, and assist data reporters in aggregating data containing multiple race responses. 3.0 Field Instructions and Training Procedures  Work to develop interview instructions and interviewer training procedures will begin in the Spring of 1999 and conclude on July 31, 1999. Different training modules and interviewer instructions depending on the mode of administration and the type of data collection will be developed and hopefully tested by organizations involved in data collection operations. Work on field instruction and training will, in all likeliness, not address new issues or problems. For example, some household interviewers have for years been using flashcards for race questions and are experienced in helping a respondent understand response categories and so forth. However, since the revised standards do encompass several distinct changes, it seems timely to address in a more systematic way issues in the fielding of the questions, and ways that interviewers can be trained to improve data quality. Specific procedures on how to ask the questions and, in some 111    cases, how to instruct the respondent to use the flashcard will be developed as well as suggested interviewer probes, definitions, and statements that can be used to answer respondent questions. It is known from past surveys that at a minimum, guidance should be provided regarding the following: C What should the interviewer say if the response is multiracial, biracial, or some other term or phrase without a specific race combination mentioned? C What should the interviewer say if the response is Hispanic, Latino, or some other term indicating Hispanic or Latino origin? C What are the general probes and/or definitions that interviewers should use for responses such as American, Swedish, Jewish, and so forth? C What is the interviewer response to a refusal or a response of ""other?""  112    Some Suggested References and Helpful Readings Aday, L. (1989).

(If yes)  What are those other races?  3. When you' completed forms or interviews which asked for (your /other person' race, have ve s) you always answered with the same race, or has your answer been different?  4. If yes, Hispanic......have you ever reported your race as Hispanic or Latino? Do you find race questions confusing or easy to answer?  5. Were there any questions in this interview that you think some people might find difficult? If so, which ones? Why?  6. Were there any questions in this interview that you think some people might find sensitive? If so, which ones? Why?  7. Is there anything in these questions that you think we should change?

Today, we are asking for your help in testing a new form which asks for some general information about the people who work in your agency (organization, firm). We have found that the best way to design these forms is to try them out with a variety of people to see how easy or hard they are to complete. What I would like you to do is first look at the form and tell me what you think it is asking you to do. There are no right or wrong answers but your first impression will help us understand how other people will interpret the purpose of the form. Then, I' like you to try to fill it out without d asking me to help you. After completing the form, I will ask you some questions about your answers, and you can also tell me more about what you like and don' like about the form. t Before we begin, do you have any questions to ask of me? (If yes, answer as neutrally as possible. If specific to questionnaire, tell respondent we will talk about this later). Okay. Here' the form. Please take a minute to look at it and then I' ask you some questions. s ll  1. Can you tell me in your own words what this form is asking you to do?  2. What is your general reaction to the form?  3. How easy or difficult is it to understand? Are you pretty sure you know what to do or are you confused?  122    Now before you try to fill it out, I have a task for you to do. After you are done with the task, you might have a better idea of how to complete the form. NOTE: On-site establishment interviews are conducted using the organization' personnel s data. Lab interviews are conducted by giving participants 100 ""dummy"" records.  Pretend that your school/organization gained 100 new students/employees during the year. You are responsible for reporting the race and Hispanic or Latino origin of those 100 students/employees to your boss. For example, your boss wants to know how many white were students/employees, how many black or African American students/employees, etc.  Now, I would like to let you know about some recent changes in OMB reporting requirements. First of all, it is specified that respondents may select more than one race.  Second, the category Asian/Pacific Islander has been broken out into two categories: Asian and Native Hawaiian.  You may want to use these blanks sheets as worksheets to extract the information from these records of your 100 new students/employees.  Now use these numbers to fill out the form. If you aren' sure what to do, try to guess rather than t ask me a question. (make a note if you have a question) We can talk afterwards about what you are unsure of.  123    DEBRIEFING QUESTIONS  1. Now that you have worked with the form, can you tell me in your own words what the form asked you to do?  2.  What question or questions does your agency ask to obtain race/ethnicity data from its students (clients)?  3.  How well would this form work for report racial and ethnic data in your current data system?  4.  How are your school's/company' race/ethnicity data broken out? s  5.  Do your records include multi-racial data? If yes, would you be able to categorize it in a way that you could complete this form?  6.  How did you arrive at your numbers? Go over with me the parts of the form you completed and what you did to enter the number.  7.  What does (racial group) mean to you?  8.  What does the Hispanic or Latino instruction mean to you?  9.  What does single race only on this form mean to you?  10.  What does plus one or more other races on this form mean to you? 124    11.  Were there any items on this form that you think some people might find difficult? If so,  which ones? Why? (What makes them difficult?)   12.  What about the amount of detail that this form asks for... . Do you think the form asks for  enough detail? Do you think the form asks for too much detail?   13.  What did you like about the form?   14.  What did you dislike about the form?   15.  Were there any questions that you find sensitive? If so, which ones?    16.  Is there anything on this form that you think we should change? If yes, what are those  changes?   17.  How did you interpret the 'total population' boxes?   18.  Did you have any records that you couldn' fit into one of the boxes? Where did you put  t people whom you couldn't fit into a category? How have you handled situations like this in  the past?  How long would it take for you to gather the information to complete this form?  What did you think about the instructions? What should be changed?  Before today, were you aware of the Federal Government' recent revision to race and  s ethnicity standards and that multiple race responses are now acceptable in government  surveys?  125   19. 20. 21.   ATTACHMENT C: TESTING PLAN AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS OF JANUARY 11, 1999  SELF-REPORTED RACE AND HISPANIC ORIGIN QUESTIONS  Condition Interview Mode Hispanic Question Race Question Race and Ethnic Background of Subject' Mother and Father s American Indian Asian Black/Af.

Introduction      The estimated size of the foreign-born population of the United States in 2002 was 32.5 million based on data collected in the Current Population Survey (CPS) - Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC). 2   In absolute terms, this estimate represented an increase of 64.2 percent or 12.7 million over the estimated 19.8 million in the 1990 census, the largest foreign-born population living in the United States since record-keeping began in 1850. 3       The challenge of monitoring the welfare of this newly arrived and large foreign-born population has created a demand for statistical information. 4   Until 1994, when nativity items were added to the CPS, the decennial census was the sole source of regularly collected information about this group. 5   While census data remain a primary source of information about the foreign born for subnational governmental jurisdictions and other small areas, census data are collected only once every ten years and quickly become outdated.  In recent years, the American Community Survey (ACS) has become a new source of information.  ACS data are collected monthly and tabulated annually, and have been designed to update and eventually replace decennial census sample data. 6   The relatively larger ACS sample yields more precise estimates than the CPS, for both subnational geographic areas and foreign-born population subgroups.                                  Over the past three years, the Census Bureau has been developing and testing a citizenship question for inclusion in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) core questionnaire.  The new question is designed to identify who is native and who is foreign born, and within the foreign-born-population, who claims U.S. citizenship.  As SIPP is a longitudinal survey, chronological timing can be established between factors such as the acquisition of citizenship and participation in social programs. 7   Compared with the CPS, ACS, or census, the SIPP sample is relatively small, and subnational estimates or national estimates by detailed demographic subgroups are not statistically precise.        Several aspects of CPS data make it essential for research and evaluation: 8             CPS nativity items produce additional information about the foreign born compared      with censuses, ACS, or SIPP.  For example the CPS includes questions on two key      nativity items--mother's place of birth and father's place of birth, known collectively as      the ‘parental nativity’ questions. 9       CPS data can be used to measure longitudinal change in individual cases and changes      over time in aggregate variables. 10      CPS monthly or basic data are available within 30 days of collection 11       In this paper, we evaluate CPS nativity data collected between January 1994 and December 2002.  Where feasible, we compare these data with data from other sources.  We have incorporated a limited amount of the information found in ""How Well Does the Current Population Survey Measure the Foreign-Born Population in the United States?"" which evaluated the March Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) nativity data 1994 to 1997. 12   The current paper extends the period to 2002 and includes information about the monthly or basic survey. 13            1. The Current Population Survey and the foreign-born population.    1.1. Purpose of the survey.  For over sixty years, the Federal Government has collected information about the population of the United States using the Current Population Survey.  The Census Bureau assumed responsibility for the CPS in 1942.  In 1959, the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor assumed responsibility for analysis and publication of labor force and employment data from the monthly CPS. 14   The basic or monthly survey captures information about age, race, sex,  and, beginning in 1994, nativity status.  Supplemental questions have been added to the core questionnaire on both a random and periodic basis.  For example, special supplements containing immigration-related questions were added to the basic CPS in selected months in the 1980s and in 1991. 15   On the other hand, the ASEC has never included questions beyond the core items.         1.2. Selected aspects of the CPS sample design.    The CPS sample design is fully described elsewhere. 16   However, it is important to note a few aspects of the design that affect estimates of the foreign-born population derived from CPS data (discussed in more detail below):           The CPS is a multistage probability sample of housing units in the U.S.  The  Annual      Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)  includes additional sample to increase the      precision of estimates associated with selected groups.  Neither the  basic  (monthly) or      ASEC sample specifically target groups by nativity (native or foreign born).      CPS sample data are weighted to universe levels through a multistage process. The       initial  stage is based on the inverse proportion of the sampling probabilities. The  last       stage involves a ratio adjustment process where survey estimates are controlled to      independent demographic estimates based on selected characteristics such as age, sex,      race and Hispanic origin.  A demographic estimate of the foreign born is not applied      during weighting. (See Section 1.5 below)      The CPS sample frame and stratification levels are based on geography and      socioeconomic data from the latest census.  Groups such as the foreign born who are not      represented in the sample strata and non-randomly distributed across the United States      may be over or under represented from month to month depending on the location of the      housing units selected for inclusion in the sample.     Each monthly CPS sample contains eight rotation panels, and every household in the      survey is assigned to a specific panel.  Each panel is rotated in for 4 consecutive months,      out for 8 months, and back in for 4 months over a 16 month period, and then replaced.  In      any given month, one of the household panels is interviewed for the first time, one for the      second time, and so on, up to eight.  The CPS design includes a 75 percent overlap in the      sample addresses from month to month and a 50 percent overlap from year to year for the      same month, a feature that reduces sample error for month-to-month and year-to-year      comparisons.           1.3. CPS sample universe.    The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the primary sponsor of the CPS and refers to it as the ‘Household Survey’ in publications such as  Employment and Earnings .  In published reports, the Census Bureau states that the CPS universe is the civilian noninstitutionalized population.  Although it is probably easier for the lay person to think of the CPS as a household survey as opposed to a survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized population, there are a few caveats associated with either classification.    All residents of the U.S. live in either households or group quarters (GQ). 17   The GQ population can be categorized as institutionalized or noninstitutionalized and civilian or military.  People living in relatively homogeneous group quarters circumstances, such as soldiers in military barracks, patients in nursing homes, and incarcerated prisoners, are relatively easy to exclude from the civilian noninstitutionalized population.  However, other population groups such as households with military members, college students in dorm rooms whose usual place of residence is a parental home, or the staff of prisons and hospitals who live in census defined special places are more difficult to classify.     The Current Population Survey  Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)  universe is relatively equivalent to the household population because it: 1)  includes households with military members who live off post or on post with their families as long as one civilian adult lives in the housing unit; and 2) excludes most GQ units. 18   The CPS  basic  universe  is more or less equivalent with the civilian noninstitutionalized population because it excludes the  military completely.  The basic or monthly survey also excludes most group quarters units. The weighted difference between the basic and ASEC samples is about 700-800,000 people, all military.       The sample differences described above also pertain to the foreign-born population.  For example, the March 2002  basic or monthly weighted estimate  of the foreign born (excluding all military) was 32.4 million.  In contrast, the 2002  ASEC weighted estimate  of the foreign born (including some military and controlled to March 1) was 32.5 million--a difference of about 100,000 people.  Owing to the exclusion of most of the GQ population and military in households, in any given month, the basic estimate probably understates the foreign-born population by about 500,000. 19   In contrast, the  ASEC  estimate excludes only about 400,000 people because some military personnel are present in the sample cases.        1.4. CPS 2001 sample expansion.   Following Census 2000, the Census Bureau began testing an  expanded CPS monthly or basic  sample.  In July 2001, the BLS officially included the expanded sample in its labor force statistics. 20   The Census Bureau also increased the  ASEC  sample for minorities and households with children and a white householder. The  expanded ASEC  sample in 2001 consisted of 78,000 interviewed households.  The primary goal of the ASEC expansion is the production of more precise as well as reliable state estimates of low-income children without health insurance (State Children’s Health Insurance Program or SCHIP).  Although the SCHIP sample expansion was specifically designed to improve state-based estimates of children’s health insurance status, other estimates have been improved as a result of the additional sample. (See section 1.6 below.) 21        1.5. CPS sample weighting.    The CPS is a ""controlled"" survey through which the Census Bureau transforms sample counts into national population totals in several stages. 22   The initial stage of weighting is done at the household level when base-weights are assigned to sample cases (a weight equal to the inverse of the case's probability of selection).  The next major step in weighting the sample data is to inflate the base-weights by an average of about 6 to 7 percent to account for non-interview households (units eligible for interview but not actually interviewed).     The second stage of weighting involves individual person cases.  This step is designed to compensate for deficiencies resulting from survey under-coverage of the sample frame by controlling the first-stage weighted sample data to demographic estimates derived from combining census data and administrative records data.  Second-stage weights are based on three distributions derived independently of the survey:           State of residence;     Age, sex, and Hispanic origin; and     Age, sex and race.       The independent values from the demographic estimates used to weight the survey are benchmarked to the previous census.  CPS estimates benchmarked to 1990 differ from the 1990 census universe by the inclusion of a statistical adjustment for net under-enumeration in the 1990 census. No adjustment for under-enumeration resulted following Census 2000. 23   Demographic  estimates used to develop second-stage weights benchmarked to1990 were derived from a  modified census base , sometimes called MARS for the ""Modified Age-Race-Sex-Hispanic origin"" distribution, where the category ‘Other’ race has been proportionally distributed to four major race groups. 24   There was no immediate requirement for a fully developed MARS file for Census 2000. 25   Demographic estimates benchmarked to 2000 reflect change since the census for five race groups: White; Black; American Indian and Alaska Native; Asian; and Hawaiian and Pacific Islander.  Prior to 2000, the Asian and Pacific Islander groups were combined.        1.6. Change in population controls.                      In 2001, the Census Bureau introduced a new set of demographic estimates benchmarked to Census 2000.  These new estimates currently form the basis of the CPS controls or second stage weights described in Section 1.5.  For evaluative purposes, the Census Bureau retrofitted the April 2000 census-based weights to  basic  survey data from October 1999 forward. 26   Monthly or  basic  CPS data weighted to population controls benchmarked to the 1990 census and Census 2000 are shown in Figure 1. 27   The 2000 controls increased the  basic  March 2000 foreign-born population from 27.9 million (weights based on estimates benchmarked to 1990) to 29.5 million (weights based on estimates benchmarked to 2000), for a difference of about 1.6 million. 28                                     The introduction of the 2000 controls resulted in an increase of 1.9 million foreign born in the  2001  Annual Social and Economic Supplement , as shown in Table A-1, column 3. 29   The new controls added 109,000 more children and 56,000 more people 65 years and over. The labor force participation rate increased by 0.7 percentage points; unemployment rate by (0.1 percentage points); educational attainment (0.1 percentage points); child poverty (0.1 percentage points); and the poverty of those age 65 and older (0.2 percentage points). 30   The inclusion of the expanded sample discussed in Section 1.4 produced no statistical differences  for the estimates in Table A-1 . (column 4). 31         2. Conceptualizing and measuring nativity characteristics.     2.1. Identifying the foreign-born population.  Decennial census and ACS data identify the  native population  by their responses to the citizenship question: (1) Born in the U.S.; (2) Born in a U.S. Island Area e.g. Puerto Rico; or (3) Born abroad of at least one U.S. citizen parent. 32   The  foreign born  are those who reported they are (4) Naturalized citizens or (5) Not U. S. citizens.  The CPS classifies native or foreign born based on responses to both birthplace and citizenship questions.   The foreign-born population includes people currently living in the U.S. who:         Entered the U.S. with immigrant visas issued by the U.S. State Department;     Entered the U.S. in a refugee, asylum seeker status;     Entered with student, business, or other extended visas;     Entered without documents, or violated the terms of their documents while in the U.S.       Although the terms ‘foreign born’ and ‘immigrant’ are sometimes used interchangeably in reference to CPS, ACS, and census data, the Census Bureau does not ask questions about immigration status in censuses or  standard  surveys. 33   Although a foreign-born person may acquire U.S. citizenship through naturalization, not all foreign-born persons are immigrants and thus eligible for citizenship (and not all eligible immigrants acquire U.S. citizenship). 34      Unlike the census and ACS, each with one question about place of birth and one about citizenship, the CPS questionnaire includes three birthplace questions (self, mother, father) as well as three citizenship status questions (See 2.2.1 below). 35   The responses to these questions allow one to deduce the native and foreign-born populations.  During an interview, a CPS field representative (FR) asks about the birthplace of every member of the household, as well as the place of birth of each household member’s mother and father: 36            If the respondent for a given household indicates a household member was born in one of the fifty     states or Washington DC, the FR enters the ‘U.S.’ code for that case, asks the       parental nativity questions, and skips the citizenship and year of entry questions. 37          If the subject was born in Puerto Rico or another U.S. Island Area, the FR enters the appropriate    code, asks the parental nativity questions, skips the citizenship questions, and       asks the ‘year of entry’ question.     If the subject was born outside the U.S. or U.S. Island Areas, the FR skips the citizenship questions    only if responses to the parental nativity questions indicate one or both of the subject's parents was    born in the U.S. or a U.S. Island Area. All are asked the ‘year of entry’ question.      If the subject was born outside the U.S. or U.S. Island Areas, and responses to the parental nativity    questions indicate that neither of the subject's parents was born in the U.S. or a U.S. Island Area,    the FR asks the citizenship and year of entry questions. 38          2.2. Defining citizenship status.     2.2.1. CPS citizenship questions.                       After the place of birth questions identify who is foreign born, the CPS asks one or more of  the following questions about foreign-born household members:         Are you a citizen of the United States?     Were you born a citizen of the United States?     Did you become a citizen of the United States through naturalization? 39          2.2.2. Citizenship status and naturalization.  The methods used to identify citizenship status and/or naturalization are not strictly comparable across the CPS, ACS, Census 2000, and administratively collected naturalization records:         Information about citizenship status is self-reported in censuses, the ACS, and CPS.  In contrast,    naturalization information is recorded by the Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) in the Department of    Homeland Security (DHS) as part of an administrative process. 40     CPS, ACS, and census data provide a snapshot of an individual's citizenship status reported on a    particular survey date.  CPS citizenship information is collected at the time a person enters the survey    and carried forward each month the person remains in the survey. With the exception of a few cases where    information not collected in the initial interview is obtained at a later date, and actual responses   replace imputed values in the data file, citizenship information is never updated.  ACS responses are    collected once from each person in the sample and the results assembled for an annual composite      measure. Census data are collected once every ten years. The OIS compiles information about naturalization    events as they occur.     Information collection processes differ. The initial CPS interview usually takes place in the    respondent's home with a field representative and a computer assisted interviewing instrument.     Subsequent interviews are usually conducted by phone.  In contrast, ACS and census questionnaires are    initially mailed to households, filled out by a household member, and mailed back. 41    Naturalization events    are recorded as they occur, and pertain specifically to the person undergoing naturalization.     Questions about nativity differ.  CPS questions about citizenship are driven by place of birth items.     Citizenship information is solicited for only about 10 percent of the CPS household members   after an    interviewer determines the person in question was not a U.S. citizen at birth.  In contrast, both the ACS    and census forms contain a single question about citizenship status   asked for every member of a   household.  OIS naturalization information is only collected for naturalized citizens.          2.3. Year of entry.     2.3.1. Length of residence of the foreign born.  Two processes affect the size of the foreign-born population death and net migration.  Generally, net international migration of the foreign born is the result of movement to and from the U.S. by the foreign born during some specified period.  In the first paragraph of the introduction to this paper, we stated the ASEC estimate of the foreign-born population in 2002 was 32.5 million. The difference between this figure and the 19.8 million recorded in 1990 implies an increase of 64.2 percent or 12.7 million people since 1990.  This increase is the result of net migration and mortality during the period.  These figures also suggest that of the 32.5 million foreign born living in the U.S. in 2002, at least 39.1 percent had lived in the country a dozen years or less (Table 1). 42   In contrast, estimates based on answers to the CPS ‘year of entry’ question suggest 48.6 percent of the foreign born had lived in the U.S. for 12 or fewer years.        Table 1. Two illustrative estimates of the foreign born in 2002 who came to the U.S. in 1990 or later.                 Difference     Percent (90% C. I.)           2002 CPS minus 1990 census     12.7 million     39.1 (37.4 - 40.8)           2002 CPS ‘year of entry’ question     15.8 million     48.6 (47.3 - 50.0)         The 12.7 million difference in Table 1 is the result of subtracting the 1990 Census estimate of the foreign born from the 2002 ASEC estimate. This  residual  estimate excludes the foreign born who entered or re-entered the U.S. in 1990 or later and were not represented in the 1990 Census and who emigrated or died before 2002 and were not represented in the 2002 ASEC.  This residual estimate also fails to address issues associated with differential coverage between the 1990 Census and the 2002 ASEC.  The 15.8 million difference shown in Table 1 is the weighted estimate of the foreign born who entered the U.S. between 1990 and 2002 and who responded to the ASEC ‘year of entry’ question. 43   Because only people who lived in the U.S. in 2002 are represented in the ASEC, the ‘year of entry’ estimate also excludes the foreign born who entered or reentered the U.S. and died or emigrated before 2002.                                                          Sample error might explain some of the discrepancy between the residual proportion (39.1 percent) and ‘year of entry’ proportion (48.6 percent).  However the two amounts are statistically different.  A 90-percent confidence interval for the ‘year of entry’ estimate yields a range of 47.3 percent - 50.0 percent.  A similar statistic can be calculated for the 2002 ASEC - 1990 Census residual of 39.1 percent. Sample error would create an approximate range of 31.9 million - 33.0 million for the ASEC 2002 estimate of 32.5 million; a difference range of 12.2 million - 13.2 million between the 2002 and 1990 census figure; and a proportionate range of 37.4 percent to 40.8 percent. 44   Because the two 90-percent confidence intervals exclude each other they are statistically different. 45                 The CPS excludes most of the population living in group quarters, so it is possible the residual difference is somewhat understated.  However, even if all the excluded foreign born were included in the 2002 ASEC estimate, the residual would be increased by only about 400,000 people raising the difference to 13.1 million. 46   Using the exercise above, the residual difference range would increase to 12.6 million - 13.6 million and the corresponding proportionate range would be 38.1 percent - 41.5 percent. This modified range is still outside that calculated for the ‘year of entry’ proportion (47.3 - 50.0 percent).       Another possible cause of the discrepancy between the proportion based on the ASEC-census residual (39.1 percent) and the proportion based on the ‘year of entry’ estimate (48.6 percent) is misreporting.  The  residual estimate is essentially an indirect estimate because the second stage weights for the ASEC 2002 estimate are based on population estimates benchmarked to Census 2000.  In contrast, information from the ‘year of entry’ item rests entirely on the accurate reporting of past events.  Evidence suggests foreign-born respondents are not always clear about when they entered the U.S. ""to live"" because many came as students, workers, or refugees and then sought immigrant status after their actual physical arrival. 47   In addition, even if an individual understands his situation, the respondent providing information may lack the requisite knowledge.          Another source of discrepancy between the results of the residual method and results based on the ‘year of entry’ question shown in Table 1 arises because of timing.  Some of the CPS individuals providing a ‘year of entry’ of 1990 were actually enumerated in the census because the census date occurred after one-fourth of 1990 had elapsed.  In contrast, the residual results shown in Table 1 exclude the foreign born enumerated in the census who became residents between January 1 and April 1, 1990.  Because the CPS does not ask for month and year of entry, there is no way to refine this comparison.             2.3.2. Timing issues associated with ‘year of entry’ or length of residence, and  citizenship.   Because a major qualification for naturalized citizenship status is a length of residence in the United States of five years or longer, analysts sometimes cross-reference ‘year of entry’ or length of residence information with citizenship status for the purpose of examining the internal consistency of reported data or for analyzing the acquisition of citizenship by various groups.  A number of caveats are associated with this practice:          Some individuals who have resided in the U.S. for less than five years have acquired      citizenship. For example, adopted foreign-born children, foreign-born spouses, and      children born abroad of foreign-born naturalized U.S. citizens may qualify for expedited      citizenship status (less than five year wait). If the survey contains these cases,      inconsistencies will appear in a cross-reference match.      In March, when most ASEC interviews take place, only three months of the year have      elapsed. Thus a terminal length of residence of ""five years or less"" for 2002 would      include 4 years (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001) and three months (2002).  While somewhat      imprecise, ASEC year-to-year comparisons finesse this issue and provide reliable      measures of change or lack thereof.  Annualized averages from the basic files (January -      December) provide relatively precise measures of the status quo as well as year-over-year      change. 48      The issue of validity is associated with month-in-sample (MIS). Generally, the nativity      questions ( including ‘year of entry’ and citizenship) are asked once at the beginning of      the 16-month rotation period. Citizenship status can change over the interview period      while ‘year of entry’ remains stable, but neither question is asked again unless the      respondent failed to provide an answer the first time. Even if respondents answer the      question and answer it accurately, citizenship is affected by MIS. 49      Cross-referencing ‘year of entry’ and citizenship data from the CPS can produce      inconsistencies for foreign born who left the U.S. and returned at a later date.  For      example, a respondent naturalized in 1989, who left the United States in 1997 to visit      abroad and returned in1999, might answer ""yes"" to the naturalized citizenship question      in the March 2002 survey and provide a ‘year of entry’ of 1999, i.e. less than five years.           2.4. The Naturalization Rate. 50  Calibrating a rate involves identifying and measuring not only what constitutes the events in the numerator, but who is in the ""at risk"" universe in the denominator.  For example, naturalization rates involve events administered on a recurring basis by the U.S. government to a foreign-born population at risk of being naturalized.  Only the foreign-born in an immigrant status who have met the requirements for naturalization are truly eligible or ""at risk"" of being naturalized. Furthermore, the eligible foreign born meet the criteria for naturalization, die, emigrate, and become citizens every day. Thus the ""at risk"" population is in a constant state of flux.    Calculating a naturalization rate not only involves determining who is eligible for citizenship, but determining who is eligible as of a specific date since only one number can appear in a denominator.  However, should the date of eligibility be at the beginning, middle, end, or some other time during the period when the events in the numerator occur?  Table 2 shows a  hypothetical  comparison of percentages calculated using the  same  number in the numerator along with denominators from the beginning, middle, and end of a calendar year.  Assuming the data in  Table 2 are based on administrative records, and depending on how the figures were calculated, the derived percentages could be expressed as rates. Statistical significance is not an issue with non-sampled administrative data, so the observed differences would be significant. However, because the numerator is a constant, differences are only owing to changes in the denominator.          Table 2.  Hypothetical Citizenship Percentages of the Foreign Born for Year X                 Foreign Born     Naturalized Citizens     Percent           January 1     32.0 million     11.9 million     37.1           July 1     32.5 million     11.9 million     36.6           December 31     33.0 million     11.9 million     36.0         CPS, ACS, and census data should not be used to calculate naturalization rates because the denominator in percentages derived from these data do not accurately reflect the population at risk.  Rather, these survey sources should be used to calculate ‘citizenship status’ or the proportion or percentage of the foreign-born population who reported they were citizens on the survey date or another date indicated in the survey.  If the hypothetical percentages in Table 2 had been taken from the CPS they would probably not be statistically different from each other.  On the other hand, citizenship proportions derived from CPS data frequently are statistically significant. 51       Analysts may argue about whether or not measures based on data from the CPS, ACS, or census understate or overstate the ""true"" proportion of the foreign born who have become naturalized citizens, however, over time these measures are reliable-they illuminate underlying change in whatever is being measured.       2.5. Parental nativity, the foreign-stock population, and the second generation.  Earlier in this paper, we indicated the foreign-born population has been increasing in recent years. Coinciding with this increase has been a large increase in the size of the children-of-the-foreign-born population.  In 1970, the last year information about parental nativity was collected in a decennial census, the  foreign stock population  (foreign born and their children) was 33.6 million, or 16.5 percent of the U.S. population (Table 3). 52   By 2002, the foreign-stock population had increased to 62.1 million or 22.0 percent of the population.       Table 3. Foreign Stock Population: 1890, 1930, 1970, 2002 53  (Numbers in thousands; numbers in parentheses are percent of total)           Year     Total Population     Foreign Stock     Foreign or Mixed Parentage     Foreign Born           1890     62.6     20.8 (33.2)     11.5 (18.4)     9.2 (14.7)           1930     122.8     40.3 (32.8)     26.1 (21.3)     14.2 (11.6)           1970     203.2     33.6 (16.5)     24.0 (11.8)     9.6 (4.7)           2002*     282.2     62.1 (22.0)     29.6 (10.5)     32.5 (11.5)        * CPS annualized average; other data from decennial censuses.    Policy makers and analysts have long recognized that parental nativity and child welfare are linked. For example, in 1999 24.0 percent of related children under age 18 living in families with a foreign-born householder were in poverty, compared with 14.9 percent of children residing with a native householder. 54   However, because the majority of the children of the foreign born are native, child nativity and parental nativity are not equivalent. 55   Programs designed to address the needs of the children of the foreign born, for example  English as a Second Language  programs, must be linked to information about  both  parents.      Parental nativity can be deduced indirectly from ACS and census data using birthplace and citizenship information-as long as the person in question resides with both parents.  However, most adults and a significant number of children do not reside with both parents.  Because parental nativity information is not collected in the ACS and no longer collected in censuses, owing to the replacement of the question with the ancestry question beginning in 1980, the parental nativity of many people cannot be determined from these sources.      In addition to a question about each household member's place of birth, the CPS asks for mother's place of birth and father's place of birth. 56   CPS ASEC data are useful for national level comparisons and reasonably precise annualized estimates of parental nativity can be calibrated for larger states using the basic or monthly data. Subnational detailed parental nativity by characteristics such as age is relatively imprecise compared with data from censuses, however.      When they are available , subnational foreign-stock measures can be used to assess need, develop programs, and allocate program funding. For example, an official seeking assistance might argue his school district is deserving of federal help for both child and adult programs because it includes a large foreign-stock population.  Legislators seeking an equitable method for disbursing limited funds to assist communities with ""immigrant"" populations might use foreign-stock measures to rank communities on a needs basis. 57       Foreign-stock measures are also useful for business firms. Race, ethnic (Hispanic), and ancestry data are necessary, but not always sufficient for target marketing.  For example, foreign and U.S. airline companies, desirous of selling country-specific flights will use a variety of means to identify and locate customers with relatively strong links to that particular country because the foreign born and their children have been shown to be more attached to countries of origin than later generations.            Some analysts prefer the phrase  second generation  when discussing children of the foreign born.  A perusal of articles, books, policy papers, governmental reports, news articles, etc. suggests many ways of operationally defining and measuring concepts such as ""first and second generation"" or ""second generation."" Characteristics such as: age; age at the time of entry into the U.S. (if foreign born); nativity; nativity of siblings; parental nativity; presence of siblings; and household status (some persons under age 18 are householders and/or spouses); etc. can be combined to produce the following  not exhaustive  list of possibilities:           All people (native and foreign born), regardless of age, with one or more foreign-born      parents  (foreign-stock population as defined by the Census Bureau) . 58      All people (native and foreign born), regardless of age, with two foreign-born parents           (sometimes referred to as the first and second generation).      Foreign-born children, regardless of age, with two foreign-born parents.     Native children, regardless of age with one or more foreign-born parents.     Native children, regardless of age, with two foreign-born parents (sometimes referred to      as the first generation and sometimes referred to as the second generation).     All children 17 or younger with one or more foreign-born parents, etc.     All children 17 or younger who are not householders and/or spouses with one or more      foreign-born parents, etc.      All children 12 or younger with one or more foreign-born parents, etc.          2.6. Place of birth, race, and ethnicity.  The racial categories drawn from CPS data for the years 1994 to 2002 include: White; Black; American Indian or Alaska Native; and Asian and Pacific Islander. The ethnic categories include Hispanic origin and not of Hispanic origin. The population in a race category may be Hispanic or not Hispanic, and the population of Hispanic origin may be of any race.  The Census Bureau CPS based  publications issued between 1994 and 2003 have included four race or ethnic groups for discussion: Blacks; Asians and Pacific Islanders; Hispanics, and White non-Hispanics. 59   Categories of race and ethnicity are not interchangeable with the world geographic regions reported in CPS, census, and ACS reports. 60           3. Data comparability issues.     3.1. Estimates of the foreign born and sample error.  Estimates based on CPS data are subject to sampling error (non-sampling error is discussed below).  For example, the 2002 ASEC estimate of the foreign-born population is 32.5 million, and the standard error is 315,000.  A calculation of 1.645 x 315,000 produces a 90 percent confidence interval of 31.9 million to 33.0 million.  In other words, we are 90 percent confident the true value for the 2002 ASEC estimate lies somewhere between 31.9 million and 33.0 million.   Table A-2 shows estimates of the foreign born by region and country of birth for 2000, 2001, and 2002, based on data from the  Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)  controlled to March 1 second stage weights.  Countries represented by a foreign-born population of 400,000 or more in 2002 have been included.  Note that the March 1, 2000 estimate for the foreign-born population from Russia is 364,000.  A 90 percent confidence interval for this estimate is 364,000 ± (48,000 x 1.645) produces a range of 285,000 to 443,000.  This means we are 90 percent confident this interval contains the true value for the foreign-born population from Russia.  Furthermore, similarly formed intervals will contain the true population value about 90 percent of the time in repeated sampling.  Comparable estimates and ranges for the foreign born from Russia for the other two years shown in Table A-2 are: 2001 = 465,000 with a standard error of 39,000 and a range of 401,000 to 529,000; and 2002 = 508,000 with a standard error of 40,000 and a range of 442,000 to 574,000.       Table A-3 shows estimates of the foreign born by region and country of birth based on  annualized averages  of CPS monthly or  basic  survey data. Owing to the larger sample size of the annualized file (compared with the ASEC file), countries represented by a foreign-born population of 100,000+ in 2002 can be included.  The estimates for 2000, 2001, and 2002 shown in this table are calibrated from 12 months of data collected between January and December and the mid-point of these annualized averages is July 1.  Figure 2 illustrates the rolling averages line that includes the three July data points in Table A-3. 61        The July 1, 2000 annualized average for the foreign-born from Russia is 431,000. The standard error of this estimate (28,000) appears to be smaller than the comparable standard error for the March 1, 2000 ASEC estimate (48,000).  Standard error size is related to estimate size, however, and bigger estimates generally produce bigger standard errors.  Because the ASEC estimate is relatively smaller with a larger standard error, we suspect the annualized averages estimate is more precise.  A useful tool for demonstrating this is the  coefficient of variation  (standard error divided by its estimate) which allows one to normalize the relationship between estimates and standard errors.  The ASEC coefficient of variation is 48,000/364,000 or 13.1 percent.  The annualized averages CV is 28,000/431,000 or 6.5 percent, half the size of the ASEC CV.  The smaller coefficient of variation indicates the annualized averages estimate is more precise.     A 90 percent confidence interval for the annualized averages estimate produces 431,000± (28,000 x 1.645) or a range of 385,000 to 477,000.  Recall that the March 1, 2000 ASEC estimate (364,000) produced a range of 285,000 to 443,000.  The two ranges overlap and a statistical test indicates they are not statistically different.  Comparable estimates and ranges for the other annualized estimates for Russia shown in Table A-3 are: 2001 = 480,000 with a standard error of 21,000 and a range 445,000 to 515,000; and 2002 = 523,000 with a standard error of 22,000 and a confidence interval of 487,000 to 559,000.     The relatively smaller CV of annualized estimates compared with those of ASEC estimates indicates the former are statistically more precise.  For example, the 2002 ASEC foreign-born estimate discussed above is 32.5 million.  The standard error for this estimate (Table A-2.) is 315,000 with a confidence interval of 31.9 million to 33.0 million.  In contrast, the July 1, 2002 annualized average in Table A-3 is also 32.5 million with a standard error of 170,000 and a confidence interval of 32.2 million to 32.8 million.  The two estimates are not statistically different, although the annualized averages estimate is more precise as indicated by a smaller CV and a narrower confidence interval.        Table A-4 is a summary table showing information from Table A-2 and Table A-3.  As we noted above, the ASEC data were collected over three months in the early part of the year and weighted to March 1.  The monthly data reflected in the annualized averages were collected from January to December each year, and as the midpoint of the year is July 1, the annualized averages can be interpreted as estimates for that date. 62  Figure 3 shows the approximate source months for the 12-month annualized averages compared with the March ASEC sample. Note that some of the cases are identical (from the same source month). However, annualized averages have many more cases to draw on and thus can produce more precise results.          3.2. Estimates of the absolute difference, coefficients of variation, and test statistics.  Table A-2 includes the standard errors of the ASEC estimates discussed in the preceding paragraphs, as well as the standard errors of the differences between those estimates.  For example, between 2000 and 2001, the ASEC suggests the foreign-born population from Russia increased by 101,000 people.  The standard error of the difference between these two dates is 56,000.  The ratio of the absolute difference (101,000) over the standard error (56,000) is 1.81, a   test statistic  well above the 1.645 needed for significance at the 90-percent level of  confidence. 63   However, the apparent difference for 2001-2002 (43,000) is not statistically significant because the test statistic is 0.92.  On the other hand, the overall difference for the years 2002-2000 (144,000) is statistically significant (2.29).  The confidence interval for the estimate of the absolute difference 2002-2000 is 40,000 to 248,000.          Table A-3 includes standard errors for estimates of the difference between annualized averages estimates.  Neither the 2001-2000 estimate of the difference of the number of foreign born from Russia (49,000), or the 2002-2001 estimate of the difference (43,000) are statistically significant.  However, the change between 2000 and 2002 (92,000) is statistically different.  The confidence interval for this difference is 92,000± (6000 x 1.645) or a range of 82,000 to 102,000 and much narrower than the CI calibrated using the ASEC data (40,000 to 248,000).   The test statistic for the estimate of the difference for Russia 2002-2000 (92,000) is 15.21, well in excess of the 1.645 needed for statistical significance, and the CV is 6.5 percent. Comparable figures for the ASEC estimate shown in Table A-2 (144,000) are 2.29 and 43.8 percent.  Even though the annualized averages CV is much smaller and the confidence interval much narrower, the annualized averages difference of 92,000 is not statistically significantly different from the ASEC estimate of 144,000.  The annualized averages estimate is more precise, however.      Whether or not an estimate of the absolute difference is statistically significant depends on a combination of factors including: the size of the underlying universe, sample size, the amount of change, and the confidence level:             Size of the underlying universe:   The size of the underlying universe comes into play      more often when one is dealing with smaller universes.  In those cases, the finite      population correction (FPC) becomes a factor.  The FPC is used to adjust the sampling      error to account for the fact that we are sampling from a population of finite size instead      of from an infinite population as assumed in the usual theory.      Sample size:  In Table A-3, where sample size has been augmented via the aggregation of      12 months of data, the CV for the 2002 estimate of the foreign-born population (32.5      million) is .52 percent compared with .97 percent for the comparable ASEC estimate (32.5      million) shown in Table A-2.  As a result of the increased sample, estimates of the      difference for the foreign-born population from many countries including Romania      (86,000 in 2000) are statistically significant.      Amount of change:  In Table A-2, the 2000 populations of the Philippines (1.4 million)      and Haiti (395,000) differ in size and CV (8.8 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively), but      the change in the size of Haitian foreign-born population between 2000 and 2002      (174,000) is statistically significant at the 90 percent confidence level, whereas the      apparent change for the Phillippines for the same period (90,000) is not.      Confidence level:  Confidence levels affect statistical significance.  It is more difficult to      detect statistical change using a confidence level of 99 percent than using a confidence      level of 90 percent.  However, using a lower confidence level increases the possibility      that you decide a statistical change has occurred when it has not.       In general, larger sample sizes produce greater precision and less sample error, but larger samples can have larger non-sample errors which reduce the overall accuracy of estimates. No matter how large the sample size, year-to-year change may not be statistically significant if the difference is small. If the sample is maximized as in a census (i.e., sample size=population size), all differences are significant.         3.3. Non-sampling Issues.  Non-sampling issues can affect the reliability of CPS estimates of the foreign born.  For example, in New York City and Los Angeles, the CPS primary sampling units (PSUs) generally cover several contiguous neighborhoods and many apartment buildings.  The last step of the CPS sample selection process within a PSU is the ‘cluster’ stage where several housing units in the same block or building are selected for interview.  Year-after-year as the survey rotates through the selected PSUs, different neighborhoods and buildings will be included.  Characteristically, many newly arrived immigrants live in ethnic clusters in neighborhoods where ‘like’ ethnic enclaves exist side-by-side.  In New York City for instance, Jamaicans, Dominicans and other migrants from the Caribbean live in close proximity.  In successive years, as the CPS sample falls in different neighborhoods and buildings in the PSU, the size of the sample of different small groups fluctuates.  This underlying process may explain some of the ""differences"" or lack of them in Table A-3.      3.4.  Consistency with 1990 decennial census data.     3.4.1.  Known differences in the CPS foreign-born estimates with 1990 census data.  During CPS processing, country of birth values are assigned for missing values.  The edits introduce an inconsistency with 1990 census results, because country was not allocated for about 4 percent of the foreign-born population reported in the census.  Table A-5 illustrates the numerical effect on country groupings if--to be consistent with the CPS editing--unknown country is assigned in 1990.  As an example, the number of Mexican-born would increase by about five percent from 4.3 million to 4.5 million.  The percent increase by country grouping does not vary much.        3.4.2.  Consistency by country of origin and period of entry.  In Table A-6, March 1997 CPS estimates of the foreign-born for country groupings are compared to the 1990 census estimates for the same country groupings. 64   Column 1 to column 3 contrast the 1997 CPS totals with 1990 data to make rough inferences about consistency and growth since 1990.  The 27 percent increase in the foreign born population from 20.4 million in 1990 to 25.8 million in 1997 (column 7) is consistent with growth trends, where sustained international migration has more than offset mortality and emigration.  As Table A-6 shows, this change varies by region.  For example, the increase of the Mexican-born population entered since 1990 (2.3 million or 47 percent), contrasts markedly with the 15 percent decline in the European-born population.  The growth of the Mexican-born reflects high migration levels and the low mortality of a younger group, while the reverse is true for the European born.   The ""pre-1990"" CPS estimates in column 4 to column 6 narrow the consistency comparison in terms of effects such as mortality and emigration.  In the absence of coverage differences or reporting errors, the 1997 CPS estimates for the pre-1990 entry cohorts should be lower than the corresponding 1990 census counts--because only deaths and emigration can affect the size of the cohort.  The relative larger decline in the European-born population that entered before 1990 (-28 percent) can be attributed to the combined forces of mortality and emigration, especially mortality. The anomalous increase in the Mexican-born population represents some residual inconsistencies in the data (such as misreporting of period of entry, different coverage levels in the CPS and Census, or other sources).        3.5. Consistency with Census 2000 data.     3.5.1. Census 2000 nativity data.  In 2000, a number of changes occurred which led to greater consistency between the census and CPS data series.  First, Census 2000 nativity items were fully allocated for missing values.  In other words, cases with place of birth item non-response were assigned imputed values using a procedure similar to that employed in the CPS. 65   Secondly, Census 2000 data were not adjusted for a net undercount and therefore the census-based estimates that drive the second stage weights have not been adjusted. 66   Third, the rewording of the Census 2000 age question and other improvements limited the need to modify the census based file used to create population estimates to only the race item. 67        3.5.2. Census 2000 and CPS 2000.   Census 2000 indicates 31,107,889 foreign born people were living in the U.S. on April 1, 2000.  On the other hand, several CPS ASEC-based reports suggest the foreign-born population in March 2000 was 28.4 million. 68   More recently, products issued by the Census Bureau, such as the  Foreign Born Population of the United States, Current Population Survey   March 2000 Detailed Tables (Revised) , show the 2000 foreign-born number as 29,985,000. 69       Universe coverage explains some of the observed difference between census and CPS figures. As we noted above, census data include every resident of the United States, whereas the CPS (ASEC or basic) covers a subset of the total population - most of the household population plus relatively few individuals living in group quarters.  In 2000, the census enumerated 373,863 foreign born people living in group quarters, or about 1.2 percent of the foreign born population. Most of these individuals are not included in the CPS.  Second stage weights explain the remainder of the difference (Section 1.5 and Figure 1).     Data users interested in which source to use, Census 2000, ACS or CPS, should consider options relative to needs.  Census data provide more precise estimates for every level of geography but become outdated for some purposes. The ACS is designed to replace the census long form and provide annual subnational estimates.  Both the ACS and CPS are ""controlled"" with demographic estimates benchmarked to the last census so national and state totals from these two sources should be very similar. 70      Flexibility and timeliness are great strengths of the CPS. CPS national level estimates, and beginning with 2001 state level estimates, are available on a monthly (basic) and annual (ASEC) basis and can be used to build a time series.  Table 4 shows derived estimates from the ASEC - based products for the years 1999 to 2002.  Included are the median ages, proportions age 65 and older, and poverty rates for the total, native and foreign-born populations.  Although the 2000 estimates appear to be dissimilar, the observed differences are owing to changes in underlying population controls.  While there is sampling error associated with these differences, the amount of sampling error is trivial.         Table 4.

Conclusions.  This paper addresses the question posed in our earlier paper, ""How Well Does the Current Population Survey Measure the Foreign-Born Population in the United States?""  The answer is   pretty well.  The analyst must determine when the data effectively measure a condition, and when the range of error is so great as to make assessment impossible. The CPS nativity data provide a reliable basis for tracking the total foreign-born population at the national level and with the introduction of the SCHIP sample offer interesting possibilities for tracking states where the foreign born population is concentrated.  Furthermore, annualized averages of CPS data may prove to be useful for some research purposes such as identifying country-specific trends.    The nativity data series is being used to monitor everything from child welfare to compositional shifts.  The potential for tracking key social and economic indicators associated with the foreign-born  population in the United States increases as the series expands.  The accumulating data series allows analysts to derive two-year and three-year moving averages for tracking educational attainment, income, poverty, program usage, and other measures of well-being using the Annual Social and Economic Supplement. Changes in moving averages can be assessed with time series analysis techniques that mitigate some of the limitations of year-to-year data comparisons. Another methodological approach that can overcome some of the data limitations involves the use of annual averages, based on 12 calendar months of data and comparable to the annual averages found in  Employment and Earnings .    The new Current Population Survey nativity questions provide a rich and useful body of information about an important segment of the population of the United States of America.   With the data from the CPS, policy makers will have access to information that can be used to track the process by which the foreign born become integrated into the U.S. economy and society.        1 This paper updates an earlier paper that evaluated Current Population Survey (CPS) foreign-born data from 1994 to 1997.  See Schmidley, A.D. and Robinson, J. G.,   How Well Does the Current Population Survey Measure the Foreign-Born Population in the United States?   Population Division Working Paper Series,  No. 22. U.S. Census Bureau, 1998.  Comparisons in this paper have undergone statistical testing and are significant at the 90-percent confidence level unless otherwise noted.     2 Beginning in 2003, the March Annual Demographic Supplement was renamed the Annual Social and Economic Supplement or ASEC.  Sometimes referred to as the civilian noninstitutionalized population, and sometimes referred to as the household population, the population universes of the ASEC and basic (monthly) surveys are discussed below.     3 Schmidley, A.D.

U.S. Census Bureau. 2002     4 In 1996, the U.S. government enacted the  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 .  Both laws contain provisions for monitoring the welfare of the foreign born and native and foreign-born children of foreign born parents.  In 2001, the Census Bureau officially implemented a CPS sample expansion of 28,000 households designed to improve the accuracy of state estimates of children’s health insurance coverage.  The SCHIP expansion is  discussed in Section 1.4  below.     5 Schmidley, A. D.   Profile of the Foreign-Born Population in the United States:2000 (P23-206) . U.S. Census Bureau. 2001.  Appendix A. ""Foreign Born and Other Terms: Definitions and Concepts"" pp.55-56.  The foreign-born population includes both immigrants and non-immigrants.  The latter includes temporary workers with work permits, long-term visitors, diplomats, foreign students, unauthorized migrants, etc.     6 The sample or long-form questionnaire is the source of census nativity data.  The ACS questionnaire replicates the long form.     7 One of the effects of the legislation cited in Footnote 4 may have been increased acquisition of U.S. citizenship.     8 For more information, see Malone, Nolan J.,  Evaluating Components of International Migration: Consistency of 2000 Nativity Data,   9 .  Population Division Working Paper Series, No. 66. U.S. Census Bureau, 2002.     9 Studies involving the welfare of children of the foreign born are dependent on these data.     10 For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks monthly unemployment rates using basic CPS data, and economists create 3-month moving averages for econometric models.     11 ACS annualized estimates lag CPS annualized estimates by about eight months.     12 U. S. Census Bureau Population Division Working Paper No. 22, 1998.  Although ASEC cases are interviewed in February, March, and April, the ASEC has been traditionally linked with March because ASEC second stage weights are based on demographic estimates of the civilian noninstitutionalized population as of March 1.  See Section 1.5. ""CPS Sample Weighting"" for more information.     13 See Footnote 1.     14 U.S. Department of Labor,  Employment and Earnings, January 2002 .     15 Throughout the 1980s and in 1991 the Census Bureau collected intercensal data on the foreign born by including supplements to selected monthly CPS surveys fielded in April 1983, June 1986, June 1988,  November 1989, and November 1991.   For additional information about the 1980s supplements (1991 excluded), see  Guide to International Statistics: The Sources, Collection, and Processing of Foreign-Born Population Data at the U.S. Census Bureau , J.

Definitions’,  Census 2000 Summary File 1 United States , U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington DC, 2000.  See  Design and Methodology , Current Population Survey Technical Paper 63RV, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington DC, March 2000, pages 3-7 for CPS definitions.     18 Occasionally a sample housing unit is discovered to be a group quarters after the field representative (FR) begins interviewing.  Nevertheless, the FR collects information about each person living in the unit and that information is included in the CPS ‘person’ file. These cases are identified as ""in group quarters"" on the person file and omitted from the household file.  College students in dorm rooms whose usual place of residence is a parental home are classified as part of the CPS household population even though they could be considered members of the GQ population.  See Figure 7-5 ""Summary table for determining who is to be included as a member of the household"" page 7-6, in  Design and Methodology , Current Population Survey Technical Paper 63RV, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington DC, March 2000.     19 The total resident foreign-born population in April 1, 2000 was 31,107,889 which included 373,863 foreign born persons living in group quarters, or about 1.2 percent of the foreign born.  In contrast, the foreign-born group quarters  population enumerated in the 1990 Census was about 0.5 million people.  See ""Appendix C. Comparison of Population Universes"" in  Profile of the Foreign-Born Population in the United States, 2000 . Washington DC, 2001.     20 The number of eligible households was increased from 50,000 to 60,000. Of the eligible basic households, approximately 56,000 were actually interviewed monthly.     21 See ""Appendix B. Sample Expansion and Introduction of Census 2000-Based Population Controls"" page 32, in  Poverty in the United States: 2001  (P60-219).

Washington DC, March 2002.     23 The Census 2000 count of 281.4 million is 0.34 million lower than the revised Demographic Analysis (DA)  estimate of 281.8 million.   Relative to DA, the difference implies a net undercount of 0.12 percent. This net coverage is dramatically different from that in the 1990 or any other previous census. In 1990, the revised net undercount estimated by DA was 4.2 million or 1.65 percent. See U.S. Bureau of the Census. 2001b.

Policy II, Report No.1, October 13.     24  Beginning in January 2003, the CPS will include a new race question that will undoubtedly lead to additional changes.  For more information about the development of the 1990 MARS file, see ‘Modification of the census race and age distributions,’ page D-14 in ""Appendix D. Derivation of Independent Population Controls"",  Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology , Technical Paper No. 63RV.   Washington DC, March 2002.     25 A 1990 type file was obviated by changes in the Census 2000 age question. However, a modified race file was created.  See  Modified Race Data Summary File, 2000 Census of Population and Housing Technical Documentation . Issued September 2002 by the U.S. Census Bureau, Washington DC.     26 Official CPS data released through December 2001 reflect the 1990 benchmark.     27 Monthly estimates before 1994 were benchmarked to the 1980 Census. The marked increase between December 1995 and January 1996 is owing to a sample cut in the ten largest states.  Apparently, the cut disproportionately affected the native and foreign-born populations.     28 The foreign-born population estimate (29,480,000) reflected in Figure 1. Foreign Born in the U.S., January 1994 - December 2002, differs from the estimate shown in Table 5  (30,081,000) of  Evaluating Components of International Migration: Consistency of 2000 Nativity Data , Population Division Working Paper No. 66  by Nolan Malone.  Figure 1 reflects CPS  basic  or monthly results controlled to  final  Census 2000 results, whereas the Malone report reflects the 2000 ASEC estimate weighted with preliminary Census 2000 results.  The 2000 ASEC estimate reweighted with final Census 2000 results is 29,985,000.     29 In 2000, the  weighted  difference between the basic and ASEC foreign-born samples controlled to March 1, 2000 was 29,985,000 - 29,480,000 or 505,000 members of the military living in households.  In 2001, this difference was 31,811,000 - 31,435,000 or 376,000.     30 These differences result from a change in the population control. While there is sampling error associated with these differences, the amount of sampling error is trivial.  Therefore, no significance testing was performed on these differences.     31 Estimates not shown in this table may have been affected by the expanded sample.     32 Currently, the wording in census and ACS questionnaires asks about birth abroad to an ""American"" parent.  The CPS backs into the question by determining the birth place of the respondent and each parent.  Those born abroad with both parents born abroad are asked about citizenship status, but never asked if they were born abroad to an American parent.     33 Exceptions occur in special supplements.

See Table A1 ""Citizenship: ‘flagged’ foreign born cases from the March 1997 CPS"" in  How Well Does the Current Population Survey Measure the Foreign Born Population in the United States?   Population Division Working Paper Series No. 22. U.S. Census Bureau, Washington DC. April 1998.     36 Information about a new respondent is added when his household joins the survey, or when she joins a household already in the survey.     37 All states receive the same code in the CPS. In the decennial censuses and ACS each state has a unique code.     38 The field representative asks all persons born outside the 50 states and DC, ‘When  did [...] come to the United States to live?’     39 See Appendix A for a topical version of the citizenship questions.     40 In 2003 the Immigration and Naturalization Services was absorbed by the new Department of Homeland Security. Naturalization functions are administered by the OIS.     41 Non-responses are followed up with a telephone interview.     42 The residual of 12.7 million divided by 32.5 million = 39.1 percent.     43 Schmidley, A.

These respondents are not re-asked core questions such as sex, race, marital status, place of birth, or citizenship status.     50 Schmidley, A. D. ""What is a Naturalization Rate?""

The foreign-stock population consists of the foreign born + those with a foreign-born mother and native father + those with a native mother and foreign-born father + those with two foreign-born parents. Intermarriage rates between natives and the foreign born affect group measures.  The question on nativity or birthplace of parents, which was included in censuses from 1890 to 1970, was replaced in 1980 with a question on ancestry that was based on self-identification, with no restriction on how many generations removed from their ancestors’ country or countries of origin.     53 Gibson, C.

However, reports based on CPS data do not show as much detail as census-based reports owing to sample size.  Census Bureau foreign-born reports issued through 2003 and based on CPS survey data from 2002 or earlier do not include information about American Indians or Alaska Natives. For an explanation, see Footnote 1 in  Section 9.  ""Hispanic Origin and Race"" in  Profile of the Foreign-Born Population in the United States, 2000. (P23-206) . U.S. Census Bureau. Washington DC. 2001.     60 For example, the CPS reported 15.3 percent of the foreign born were from Europe.  However, 67.9 percent of the foreign born were White in 2000, and more than half of the White foreign born were Hispanic and from Spain, Latin America, and other parts of the world.  See Table 9-1A.

U.S. Census Bureau. 2001.     61 A rolling average consists of a string of consecutive 12-month average estimates.  Each 12-month estimate is created by dropping the oldest month and adding the newest month.  Thus the average for July in year x would be based on data from January to December of year x, and the average for August of year x would be based on data from February of year x through January of year x+1.     62 The CPS sample is designed to produce the effect of sampling with replacement where each monthly sample independently represents the U.S. population. Thus CPS annualized averages are obtained by adding 12 independent samples together and dividing by 12.     63 The ‘coefficient of variation’ is the ratio of the standard error over the estimate and thus the inverse of the test statistic.     64 See Schmidley, A.D. and Robinson, J.

EDT, JANUARY 3, 2001 (WEDNESDAY)                                   Public Information Office                                       CB01-04 301-457-3030/301-457-3670 (fax) 301-457-1037 (TDD) e-mail: pio@census.gov  Lisa Lollock 301-457-2403                   Foreign-Born Population Nears 30 Million,                             Census Bureau Estimates     A new report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau today estimates that the nation's foreign-born population in 2000 was  28.4 million about 1 in 10 U.S. residents.    The estimates contained in the report,  The Foreign-Born Population in the United States: March 2000,  should not be confused with Census 2000 results, which are scheduled for release over the next three years.    ""About 10 percent of the nation's population was foreign-born in 2000,"" said Lisa Lollock, the report author. ""This proportion is between the high figure of 15 percent reached during a period of heavy immigration from Europe in 1890 and the low of 5 percent in 1970.""    The report said one-third of the foreign-born population was from Mexico or another Central American country and about one-fourth, from Asia.    Other highlights from the report:    -- The foreign-born population are more likely than natives to live in      the West and the Northeast. More than 6 in 10 of the foreign-born      population reside in one of these two regions, compared with less      than 4 in 10 natives.    -- Almost half of the foreign-born population lived in the central city      of a metropolitan area (45 percent) compared with slightly more than      one-quarter of the native population (28 percent). Only 5 percent of      the foreign-born population lived outside metro areas, compared with      21 percent of natives.    -- While foreign-born residents age 25 and over were as likely as      natives to be college graduates (26 percent each), they lagged at      lower educational levels, as 67 percent of the foreign-born population       and 87 percent of natives were high school graduates. Thirty-six      percent of full-time, year-round workers born outside the United      States earned less than $20,000 in 1999; this compares with       21 percent of their native counterparts who were at that level.    -- Foreign-born people were more likely than natives to be 18 to 64      years of age (8 in 10 compared with 6 in 10).    -- Thirty-seven percent of the nation's foreign-born residents were      naturalized citizens. Less than 1 in 10 of the foreign-born people      who entered the United States in the 1990s had become citizens,      compared with 8 in 10 who arrived before 1970.    The report, a slide presentation, an interactive quiz and 60 statistical tables update the 1999 report on the foreign-born population issued last September. The statistics were collected in the March 2000 Current Population Survey, which uses the 1990 census as a base for its sample.    The report contains data on characteristics of the foreign-born population such as region of birth, geographic distribution in the United States, age, citizenship, household size, marital status, educational level, employment status, occupation, earnings and poverty status. Comparisons are made between the foreign-born and the native populations, as well as among the foreign-born population by region of birth, citizenship and year of entry.    Survey data are subject to sampling and nonsampling error.    -X-        Foreign-Born Population and Percent of Total Population               for the United States: 1890 to 2000                                            Year                Number                 Percent                          (in millions)             of total                                      2000                  28.4                  10.4         1990                  19.8                   7.9         1970                   9.6                   4.7         1950                  10.3                   6.9         1930                  14.2                  11.6         1910                  13.5                  14.7         1890                   9.2                  14.8                                   Source: U.S. Census Bureau          Source: U.S. Census Bureau  Public Information Office  (301) 763-3030     Last Revised: March 21, 2001 at 01:10:12 PM                Newsroom   |  News Releases   |  Broadcast Services  |  Tip Sheets  |  Facts for Features  |  Minority Links  |  Webcasts                   Census 2000   |   Subjects A to Z    |   Search   |   Product Catalog    |   Data Tools   |   FOIA     |   Quality   |   Privacy · Policies   |   Contact Us   |   Home"

This data is not published in hard copy by the US Census         Bureau.           These disks are available         for use at US Depository Libraries such as Providence Public Library and         libraries at Brown University, Salva Regina University and the         University of Rhode Island. Published census data is also available at         these libraries.           The format of these tables         has been developed by The Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation         in cooperation with The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training to         meet the US Census Labor Force Data required in an Affirmative Action         Plan. This table summarizes the data for 512 occupations provided in the         EEO File. Labor force data is based on the population of the United         States 16 years old and over as of April 1, 1990.           Area Definitions are those         in effect during the 1990 US Census as defined by The US Office of         Management and Budget June 30, 1983.  The basic Data is provided in         a 12 page Summary.           Table 1  provides a table giving total         population and total labor force by minority status.           Table 2  provides a table giving total         Persons 16 years old and over, Total Labor Force, Participation Rate,         Total Employed, Total Employed, and the Unemployment Rate by Sex, Race         and Hispanic Origin. NOTE: in this table Those of Hispanic Origin are         also enumerated again in one of the five race categories.

The CTPP is a set of special tabulations of 2000 census data tailored to meet the data needs of transportation planners nationwide. The 2000 CTPP was sponsored by the State Departments of Transportation under a pooled funding arrangement with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics also provided funding to develop the CTPP Program.  The CTPP2000 is a series of tabulations for various levels of geography, including state, county, place, census tract and block group, and traffic analysis zone (TAZ). The tables in the CTPP relate social and demographic characteristics of persons, households, and workers to the journey-to-work characteristics, such as travel time and travel mode to work. The most important item to the transportation community from Census 2000 is the journey-towork data. The Census 2000 questionnaire (see Appendix J) included many items that are vital to transportation planning at the State and local government levels A working group consisting of members from the sponsors and experts in the field from the State and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) was established to develop the specifications for the CTPP-2000 tabulations. Three types of data tabulations are provided in the CTPP:    Place of residence tables show the number and characteristics of housing units, persons, and workers who live in each geographic area. Place of work tables show the number and characteristics of persons who work in each geographic area (regardless of where they live), and Commuter flow tables show the number and characteristics of persons in each worktrip origindestination pair of geographic areas.  The three types of data tabulations are produced for a full range of areas in the geographic hierarchy. Summary levels include State, county, minor civil division, and place. At the detailed geographic level, users choose to receive data either for census tracts, or for block groups, or for TAZs. The statewide tabulations provide data for households, persons, and workers in the state and for workers who work in the state. The statewide component contains data matrices for residence area geography, for workplace geography, and for travel flows between workers' residence area and workplace area. Data was tabulated for the state, each county, county subdivision, and places of 2,500 or more persons. Totals for state parts of (MSAs), CMSAs, and PMSAs will also be provided, as will urbanized area totals (place of residence data only). Urban tabulations were produced for the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) in each area where Census TIGER/Line files contain address ranges. This generally includes all urbanized areas except some of the most newly-defined. The urban tabulations contain the same matrices as the statewide tabulations. Like the statewide component, the urban component contains data matrices for residence area geography, for workplace geography, and for travel flows between workers' residence area and workplace area. Data were tabulated for either for standard census geography like census tracts or block groups, or for locally-defined custom geographic areas like traffic analysis zones (TAZs), at the request of the Metropolitan Planning Organization. In addition to this detailed geography, subtotals for MSA, CMSA,  7   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  PMSA, and urbanized area (place of residence data only) are also provided.  CTPP PROFILES The first data product of the Census Transportation Planning Package 2000 (CTPP2000) was the CTPP Profiles (November 2002). The Census Bureau prepared profile sheets for States, Counties and New England MCDs, which are posted on the AASHTO web page at http://ctpp.transportation.org in both html format and pdf format. One convenience of these profile sheets is that they include data from both 1990 and 2000 Censuses for some basic characteristics such as household size, vehicle availability, means of transportation to work, and travel time to work.  8   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AGE The data on questionnaire the person in date of birth unavailable. age, which was asked of all people, were derived from answers to the long-form item 4 and short-form questionnaire Item 6. The age classification is based on the age of complete years as of April 1, 2000. The age of the person usually was derived from their information. Their reported age was used only when date of birth information was  Data on age are used to determine the applicability of some of the sample questions for a person and to classify other characteristics in census tabulations. Age data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and examine many programs and policies. Therefore, age is tabulated by single years of age and by many different groupings, such as five-year age groups.  Median age Median age divides the age distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median age and one-half above the median. Median age is computed on the basis of a single year of age standard distribution (see the ""Standard Distributions"" section under ""Derived Measures""). Median age is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on medians, see ""Derived Measures."") Limitation of the data. The most general limitation for many decades has been the tendency of people to over report ages or years of birth that end in zero or five. This phenomenon is called ""age heaping."" In addition, the counts in the 1970 and 1980 censuses for people 100 years old and over were substantially overstated. So also were the counts of people 69 years old in 1970 and 79 years old in 1980. Improvements have been made since then in the questionnaire design and in the imputation procedures which have minimized these problems. Review of detailed 1990 census information indicated that respondents tended to provide their age as of the date of completion of the questionnaire, not their age as of April 1, 1990. One reason this happened was that respondents were not specifically instructed to provide their age as of April 1, 1990. Another reason was that data collection efforts continued well past the census date. In addition, there may have been a tendency for respondents to round their age up if they were close to having a birthday. It is likely that approximately 10 percent of people in most age groups were actually one year younger. For most single years of age, the misstatements were largely offsetting. The problem is most pronounced at age zero because people lost to age one probably were not fully offset by the inclusion of babies born after April 1, 1990. Also, there may have been more rounding up to age one to avoid reporting age as zero years. (Age in complete months was not collected for infants under age one.) The reporting of age one year older than true age on April 1, 1990, is likely to have been greater in areas where the census data were collected later in calendar year 1990. The magnitude of this problem was much less in the 1960, 1970, and 1980 censuses where age was typically derived from respondent data on year of birth and quarter of birth. These shortcomings were minimized in Census 2000 because age was usually calculated from exact date of birth and because respondents were specifically asked to provide their age as of April 1, 2000. (For more information on the design of the age question, see the section below that discusses ""Comparability."")  9   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Comparability. Age data have been collected in every census. For the first time since 1950, the 1990 data were not available by quarter year of age. This change was made so that coded information could be obtained for both age and year of birth. In 2000, each individual has both an age and an exact date of birth. In each census since 1940, the age of a person was assigned when it was not reported. In censuses before 1940, with the exception of 1880, people of unknown age were shown as a separate category. Since 1960, assignment of unknown age has been performed by a general procedure described as ""imputation."" The specific procedures for imputing age have been different in each census. (For more information on imputation, see ""Accuracy of the Data."")  DISABILITY STATUS The data on disability status were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire items 16 and 17. Item 16 was a two-part question that asked about the existence of the following long-lasting conditions: (a) blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment, (sensory disability) and (b) a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying (physical disability). Item 16 was asked of a sample of the population five years old and over. Item 17 was a four-part question that asked if the individual had a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting six months or more that made it difficult to perform certain activities. The four activity categories were: (a) learning, remembering, or concentrating (mental disability); (b) dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home (self-care disability); (c) going outside the home alone to shop or visit a doctor's office (going outside the home disability); and (d) working at a job or business (employment disability). Categories 17a and 17b were asked of a sample of the population five years old and over; 17c and 17d were asked of a sample of the population 16 years old and over. For data products which use the items individually, the following terms are used: sensory disability for 16a, physical disability for 16b, mental disability for 17a, self-care disability for 17b, going outside the home disability for 17c, and employment disability for 17d. For data products which use a disability status indicator, individuals were classified as having a disability if any of the following three conditions was true: (1) they were five years old and over and had a response of ""yes"" to a sensory, physical, mental or self-care disability; (2) they were 16 years old and over and had a response of ""yes"" to going outside the home disability; or (3) they were 16 to 64 years old and had a response of ""yes"" to employment disability. Comparability. The 1990 census data products did not include a general disability status indicator. Furthermore, a comparable indicator could not be constructed since the conceptual framework of the 1990 census was more limited. The questionnaire included only three types of disability in questions with four subparts. The questions asked about whether an individual had a condition that had lasted for six months or more and which (1) limited the kind or amount of work that he or she could do at a job, (2) prevented the individual from working at a job, (3) made it difficult to go outside the home alone (for example, to shop or visit a doctor's office), and (4) made it difficult to take care of his or her own personal needs such as bathing, dressing, or getting around inside the home. The 1990 disability questions were asked on the long form questionnaire of the population 15 years old and over.  EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT Data on educational attainment were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 9, which was asked of a sample of the population. Data on attainment are tabulated for the population 25 years old and over. However, when educational attainment is cross-tabulated by other variables, the universe may  10   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  change. (For example, when educational attainment is crossed by disability status, the data are tabulated for the civilian noninstitutionalized population 18 to 34 years old.) People are classified according to the highest degree or level of school completed. The order in which degrees were listed on the questionnaire suggested that doctorate degrees were ""higher"" than professional school degrees, which were ""higher"" than master's degrees. The question included instructions for people currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received. Respondents who did not report educational attainment or enrollment level were assigned the attainment of a person of the same age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, occupation and sex, where possible, who resided in the same or a nearby area. Respondents who filled more than one box were edited to the highest level or degree reported. The question included a response category which allowed respondents to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. It allowed people who received either a high school diploma or the equivalent, for example, passed the Test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.) and did not attend college, to be reported as ""high school graduate(s)."" The category ""Associate degree"" included people whose highest degree is an associate degree, which generally requires two years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor's degree. Master's degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Some examples of professional degrees include medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. Vocational and technical training such as barber school training; business, trade, technical, and vocational schools; or other training for a specific trade are specifically excluded.  High school graduate or higher This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received a college, university, or professional degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not high school graduates.  Not enrolled, not high school graduate This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as ""high school dropouts."" However, there is no criterion regarding when they ""dropped out"" of school, so they may have never attended high school. Comparability. From 1840 to 1930, the census measured educational attainment by means of a basic literacy question. In 1940, a single question was asked on highest grade of school completed. In the 1950 to 1980 censuses, a two-part question was used to construct highest grade or year of school completed. The question asked (1) the highest grade of school attended and (2) whether that grade was finished. For people who have not attended college, the response categories in the current educational attainment question should produce data which are comparable to data on highest grade completed from earlier censuses. For people who attended college, there is less comparability between years of school completed and highest degree. Beginning in 1990, the response categories for people who have attended college were modified from earlier censuses because there was some ambiguity in interpreting responses in terms of the number of years of college completed. For instance, it was not clear whether ""completed the fourth year of college,"" 11   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  ""completed the senior year of college,"" and ""college graduate"" were synonymous. Research conducted shortly before the 1990 census suggests that these terms were more distinct than in earlier decades, and this change may have threatened the ability to estimate the number of ""college graduates"" from the number of people reported as having completed the fourth or a higher year of college. It was even more difficult to make inferences about post-baccalaureate degrees and ""Associate"" degrees from highest year of college completed. Thus, comparisons of post-secondary educational attainment in the 2000 and 1990 censuses with data from the earlier censuses should be made with great caution. Changes between 1990 and Census 2000 were slight. The two associate degree categories in 1990 were combined into one for Census 2000. ""Some college, no degree"" was split into two categories, ""Some college credit, but less than 1 year,"" and ""1 or more years of college, no degree."" Prior to 1990, the college levels reported began with ""Completed 1 year of college."" Beginning in 1990, the first category was ""Some college, no degree,"" which allowed people with less than 1 year of college to be given credit for college. Prior to 1990, they were included in ""High school, 4 years."" The two revised categories will accommodate comparisons with either data series and allow the tabulation of students who completed at least one year of college, as some data users wish. This will not change the total number who completed some college. The category ""12th grade, no diploma"" was counted as high school completion or ""Completed high school, 4 years"" prior to 1990 and as ""Less than high school graduate"" in 1990 and 2000. In the 1960 and subsequent censuses, people for whom educational attainment was not reported were assigned the same attainment level as a similar person whose residence was in the same or a nearby area. In the 1940 and 1950 censuses, people for whom educational attainment was not reported were not allocated. In censuses prior to 1990, ""median school years completed"" was used as a summary measure of educational attainment. Using the current educational attainment question, the median can only be calculated for groups of which less than half the members have attended college. ""Percent high school graduate or higher"" and ""percent bachelor's degree or higher"" are summary measures which can be calculated from the present data and offer quite readily interpretable measures of differences between population subgroups.  EMPLOYMENT STATUS The data on employment status (referred to as labor force status in previous censuses), were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire items 21and 25, which were asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. The series of questions on employment status was designed to identify, in this sequence: (1) people who worked at any time during the reference week; (2) people who did not work during the reference week, but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent (excluding people on layoff); (3) people on temporary layoff who expected to be recalled to work within the next six months or who had been given a date to return to work, and who were available for work during the reference week; and (4) people who did not work during the reference week, who had looked for work during the reference week or the three previous weeks, and who were available for work during the reference week. (For more information, see ""Reference Week."") The employment status data shown in Census 2000 tabulations relate to people 16 years old and over. In the 1940, 1950, and 1960 censuses, employment status data were presented for people 14 years old and over. The change in the universe was made in 1970 to agree with the official measurement of the labor force as revised in January 1967 by the U.S. Department of Labor. The 1970 census was the last to show employment data for people 14 and 15 years old.  12   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Employed All civilians 16 years old and over who were either (1) ""at work"" -- those who did any work at all during the reference week as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession, worked on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a family farm or in a family business; or (2) were ""with a job but not at work"" -- those who did not work during the reference week, but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent because of illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons. Excluded from the employed are people whose only activity consisted of work around their own house (painting, repairing, or own home housework) or unpaid volunteer work for religious, charitable, and similar organizations. Also excluded are all institutionalized people and people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces.  Civilian employed This term is defined exactly the same as the term ""employed"" above.  Unemployed All civilians 16 years old and over were classified as unemployed if they were neither ""at work"" nor ""with a job but not at work"" during the reference week, were looking for work during the last four weeks, and were available to start a job. Also included as unemployed were civilians 16 years old and over who: did not work at all during the reference week, were on temporary layoff from a job, had been informed that they would be recalled to work within the next six months or had been given a date to return to work, and were available to return to work during the reference week, except for temporary illness. Examples of job seeking activities were:       Registering at a public or private employment office Meeting with prospective employers Investigating possibilities for starting a professional practice or opening a business Placing or answering advertisements Writing letters of application Being on a union or professional register  Civilian labor force Consists of people classified as employed or unemployed in accordance with the criteria described above.  Labor force All people classified in the civilian labor force (i.e., ""employed"" and ""unemployed"" people), plus members of the U.S. Armed Forces (people on active duty with the United States Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard).  Not in labor force All people 16 years old and over who are not classified as members of the labor force. This category consists mainly of students, individuals taking care of home or family, retired workers, seasonal workers enumerated in an off-season who were not looking for work, institutionalized people (all institutionalized people are placed in this category regardless of any work activities they may have done in the reference week), and people doing only incidental unpaid family work (fewer than 15 hours during the reference week).  13   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Worker The terms ""worker"" and ""work"" appear in connection with several subjects: employment status, journey-to-work, class of worker, and work status in 1999. Their meaning varies and, therefore, should be determined by referring to the definition of the subject in which they appear. When used in the concepts ""Workers in Family,"" ""Workers in Family in 1999,"" and ""Full-time, YearRound Workers,"" the term ""worker"" relates to the meaning of work defined for the ""Work Status in 1999"" subject.  Full-time, year-round workers See ""Work status in 1999."" Limitation of the data. The census may understate the number of employed people because people who have irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs sometimes report themselves as not working. The number of employed people ""at work"" is probably overstated in the census (and conversely, the number of employed ""with a job, but not at work"" is understated) since some people who were on vacation or sick leave erroneously reported themselves as working. This problem has no effect on the total number of employed people. The reference week for the employment data is not the same calendar week for all people. Since people can change their employment status from one week to another, the lack of a uniform reference week may mean that the employment data do not reflect the reality of the employment situation of any given week. (For more information, see ""Reference Week."") Note: The Census Bureau is aware there may be a problem or problems in the employment-status data of Census 2000 Summary File 3 (including tables P38, P43P46, P149A-I, P150A-I, PCT35, PCT69A-I, and PCT70A-I). The labor force data for some places where colleges are located appear to overstate the number in the labor force, the number unemployed, and the percent unemployed, probably because of reporting or processing error. The exact cause is unknown, but the Census Bureau will continue to research the problem. Comparability. The questionnaire items and employment status concepts for Census 2000 are essentially the same as those used in the 1970 to 1990 censuses. However, these concepts differ in many respects from those associated with the 1950 and 1960 censuses. Since employment data from the census are obtained from respondents in households, they differ from statistics based on reports from individual business establishments, farm enterprises, and certain government programs. People employed at more than one job are counted only once in the census and are classified according to the job at which they worked the greatest number of hours during the reference week. In statistics based on reports from business and farm establishments, people who work for more than one establishment may be counted more than once. Moreover, some establishment-based tabulations may exclude private household workers, unpaid family workers, and self-employed people, but may include workers less than 16 years old. Census tabulations count people who had a job but were not at work among the employed, but these people may be excluded from employment figures based on establishment payroll reports. Furthermore, census employment tabulations include people on the basis of place of residence regardless of where they work, whereas establishment data report people at their place of work regardless of where they live. This latter consideration is particularly significant when comparing data for workers who commute between areas. For several reasons, the unemployment figures of the Census Bureau are not comparable with published figures on unemployment compensation claims. For example, figures on unemployment compensation claims exclude people who have exhausted their benefit rights, new workers who have not earned rights to unemployment insurance, and people losing jobs not covered by unemployment insurance systems 14   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  (including some workers in agriculture, domestic services, and religious organizations, and self-employed and unpaid family workers). In addition, the qualifications for drawing unemployment compensation differ from the definition of unemployment used by the Census Bureau. People working only a few hours during the week and people with a job, but not at work are sometimes eligible for unemployment compensation but are classified as ""employed"" in the census. Differences in the geographical distribution of unemployment data arise because the place where claims are filed may not necessarily be the same as the place of residence of the unemployed worker. The figures on employment status from the decennial census are generally comparable with similar data collected in the Current Population Survey, which is the official source of the monthly national unemployment rate. However, some differences may exist because of variations between the two data sources in enumeration and processing techniques.  GRADE IN WHICH ENROLLED The data on grade or level in which enrolled were derived from long-form questionnaire item 8b, which was asked of a sample of the population. People who were enrolled in school were classified as enrolled in ""Nursery school, preschool,"" ""Kindergarten,"" ""Grade 1 to 4"" or ""Grade 5 to 8,"" ""Grade 9 to 12,"" ""College undergraduate years (freshman to senior)"" or ""Graduate and professional school (for example: medical, dental, or law school)."" Comparability. Grade of enrollment was first available in the 1940 census, where it was obtained from responses to the question on highest grade of school completed. Enumerators were instructed that ""for a person still in school, the last grade completed will be the grade preceding the one in which he or she was now enrolled."" From 1950 to 1980, grade of enrollment was obtained from the highest grade attended in the two-part question used to measure educational attainment. (For more information, see the discussion under ""Educational Attainment."") The form of the question from which level of enrollment was derived in the 1990 census most closely corresponds to the question used in 1940. While data from prior censuses can be aggregated to provide levels of enrollment comparable to the 1990 census and Census 2000, the data from these sources cannot be disaggregated to show single grade of enrollment as in previous censuses. In the 1990 census, people who were enrolled in school were classified as enrolled in ""preprimary school,"" ""elementary or high school,"" or ""college,"" according to their response to long-form questionnaire item 12 (years of school completed or highest degree received). Those who were enrolled and reported completing nursery school or less were classified as enrolled in ""preprimary school,"" which includes kindergarten. Similarly, those enrolled who had completed at least kindergarten, but not high school, were classified as enrolled in elementary or high school. The enrolled who also reported completing high school or some college or having received a post-secondary degree were classified as enrolled in ""college."" Those who reported completing the twelfth grade but receiving ""NO DIPLOMA"" were classified as enrolled in high school. The Census 2000 question is the first to be asked only of the enrolled and does not serve to measure both year of enrollment and educational attainment. While the attainment item in 1990 served the needs for educational attainment data better than the question used in earlier censuses, it did not serve reporting of enrollment level well.  GROUP QUARTERS The group quarters population includes all people not living in households. Two general categories of people in group quarters are recognized: (1) the institutionalized population and (2) the  15   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  noninstitutionalized population.  Institutionalized Population The institutionalized population includes people under formally authorized, supervised care or custody in institutions at the time of enumeration; such as correctional institutions, nursing homes, and juvenile institutions.  Noninstitutionalized Population The noninstitutionalized population includes all people who live in group quarters other than institutions; such as college dormitories, military quarters, and group homes. Also included are staff residing at institutional group quarters. [For a complete description of the types of group quarters included in Census 2000, see the Technical Documentation for Summary File 1, 2000 Census of Population and Housing, at: [http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf1.pdf].  HISPANIC OR LATINO The data on the Hispanic or Latino population, which was asked of all people, were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 5, and short-form questionnaire Item 7. The terms ""Spanish,"" ""Hispanic origin,"" and ""Latino"" are used interchangeably. Some respondents identify with all three terms, while others may identify with only one of these three specific terms. Hispanics or Latinos who identify with the terms ""Spanish,"" ""Hispanic,"" or ""Latino"" are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the questionnaire  ""Mexican,"" ""Puerto Rican,"" or ""Cuban""  as well as those who indicate that they are ""other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino."" People who do not identify with one of the specific origins listed on the questionnaire but indicate that they are ""other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino"" are those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people identifying themselves generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on. All write-in responses to the ""other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino"" category were coded. Origin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino may be of any race. Some tabulations are shown by the origin of the householder. In all cases where the origin of households, families, or occupied housing units is classified as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino, the origin of the householder is used. (For more information, see the discussion of householder under ""Household Type and Relationship."") If an individual could not provide a Hispanic origin response, their origin was assigned using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if origin was missing for a natural-born daughter in the household, then either the origin of the householder, another natural-born child, or the spouse of the householder was assigned. If Hispanic origin was not reported for anyone in the household, the origin of a householder in a previously processed household with the same race was assigned. This procedure is a variation of the general imputation procedures described in ""Accuracy of the Data,"" and is similar to those used in 1990, except that for Census 2000, race and Spanish surnames were used to assist in assigning an origin. (For more information, see the ""Comparability"" section below.) Comparability. There are two important changes to the Hispanic origin question for Census 2000. First, 16   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  the sequence of the race and Hispanic origin questions for Census 2000 differs from that in 1990; in 1990, the race question preceded the Hispanic origin question. Testing prior to Census 2000 indicated that response to the Hispanic origin question could be improved by placing it before the race question without affecting the response to the race question. Second, there is an instruction preceding the Hispanic origin question indicating that respondents should answer both the Hispanic origin and the race questions. This instruction was added to give emphasis to the distinct concepts of the Hispanic origin and race questions, and to emphasize the need for both pieces of information. Furthermore, there has been a change in the processing of the Hispanic origin and race responses. In 1990, the Hispanic origin question and the race question had separate edits; therefore, although information may have been present on the questionnaire, it was not fully utilized due to the discrete nature of the edits. However, for Census 2000, there was a joint race and Hispanic origin edit which for example, made use of race responses in the Hispanic origin question to impute a race if none was given.  HOUSEHOLD TYPE AND RELATIONSHIP Household A household includes all of the people who occupy a housing unit. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.) A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied (or if vacant, intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other people in the building and that have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. In 100-percent tabulations, the count of households or householders always equals the count of occupied housing units. In sample tabulations, the numbers may differ as a result of the weighting process.  Average household size A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in households by the total number of households (or householders). In cases where household members are tabulated by race or Hispanic origin, household members are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual. Average household size is rounded to the nearest hundredth.  Relationship to Householder Householder The data on relationship to householder were derived from the question, ""How is this person related to Person 1,"" which was asked of Persons 2 and higher in housing units. One person in each household is designated as the householder (Person 1). In most cases, the householder is the person, or one of the people, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented. If there is no such person in the household, any adult household member 15 years old and over could be designated as the householder (i.e., Person 1). Households are classified by type according to the sex of the householder and the presence of  17   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  relatives. Two types of householders are distinguished: family householders and nonfamily householders. A family householder is a householder living with one or more individuals related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all of the people in the household related to him or her are family members. A nonfamily householder is a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only.  Spouse (husband/wife) A spouse (husband/wife) is a person married to and living with a householder. People in formal marriages, as well as people in common-law marriages, are included. The number of spouses is equal to the number of ""married-couple families"" or ""married-couple households"" in 100-percent tabulations. Marital status categories cannot be inferred from the 100-percent tabulations since the marital status question was not included on the 100-percent form. In sample tabulations, the number of spouses may not be equal to the number of married-couple households due to the differences in the weighting procedures for sample data.  Child A child is a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or an adopted child of the householder, regardless of the child's age or marital status. The category excludes sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and foster children. Natural-born son/daughter. Natural-born son/daughter includes a son or daughter of the householder by birth, regardless of the age of the child. Adopted son/daughter. Adopted son/daughter includes a son or daughter of the householder by legal adoption, regardless of the age of the child. If a stepson/stepdaughter of the householder has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is then classified as an adopted child. Stepson/stepdaughter. Stepson/stepdaughter includes a son or daughter of the householder through marriage but not by birth, regardless of the age of the child. If a stepson/stepdaughter of the householder has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is then classified as an adopted child. Own child. Own child is a never-married child under 18 years who is a son or daughter of the householder by birth, marriage (a stepchild), or adoption. For 100-percent tabulations, own children consists of all sons/daughters of householders who are under 18 years old. For sample data, own children consist of sons/daughters of householders who are under 18 years old and who have never been married. Therefore, numbers of own children of householders may be different in these two tabulations since marital status was not collected as a 100-percent item in Census 2000. In certain tabulations, own children are further classified as living with two parents or with one parent only. Own children living with two parents are by definition found only in married-couple families. In a subfamily, an ""own child"" is a child under 18 years old who is a natural-born child, stepchild, or an adopted child of a mother in a mother-child subfamily, a father in father-child subfamily, or either spouse in a married-couple subfamily. (Note: In the tabulation under ""EMPLOYMENT STATUS"" of own children under 6 years by employment status of parents, the number of ""own children"" includes any child under 6 years old in a family or a subfamily who is a son or daughter, by birth, marriage, or adoption, of a member of the householder's family, but not necessarily of the householder). 18   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Related children. Related children include the sons and daughters of the householder (including natural-born, adopted or stepchildren) and all other people under 18 years old, regardless of marital status, in the household, who are related to the householder, except the spouse of the householder. Foster children are not included since they are not related to the householder.  Other relatives Other relatives include any household member related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption, but not included specifically in another relationship category. In certain detailed tabulations, the following categories may be shown: Grandchild. A grandchild is a grandson or granddaughter of the householder. Brother/sister. Brother/sister refers to the brother or sister of the householder, including stepbrothers, stepsisters, and brothers and sisters by adoption. Brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law are included in the ""Other relative"" category on the questionnaire. Parent. Parent refers to the father or mother of the householder, including a stepparent or adoptive parent. Fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law are included in the ""Parent-in-law"" category on the questionnaire. Parent-in-law. A parent-in-law is the mother-in-law or father-in-law of the householder. Son-in-law/daughter-in-law. A son-in-law/daughter-in-law, by definition, is a spouse of the child of the householder. Other relatives. Other relatives include anyone not listed in a reported category above who is related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption (brother-in-law, grandparent, nephew, aunt, cousin, and so forth).  Nonrelatives Nonrelatives include any household member not related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption, including foster children. The following categories may be presented in more detailed tabulations: Roomer, boarder. A roomer or boarder is a person who lives in a room in the household of Person 1 (householder). Some sort of cash or noncash payment (e.g., chores) is usually made for their living accommodations. Housemate or roommate. A housemate or roommate is a person who is not related to the householder and who shares living quarters primarily to share expenses. Unmarried partner. An unmarried partner is a person who is not related to the householder, who shares living quarters, and who has a close personal relationship with the householder. Foster child. A foster child is a person who is under 18 years old in a household to receive parental care. They may be living in period or for several years. Foster children are nonrelatives of the is also related to the householder, the child should be classified as 19  placed by the local government the household for just a brief householder. If the foster child that specific relative.   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Other nonrelatives. Other nonrelatives include individuals who are not related by birth, marriage, or adoption to the householder and who are not described by the categories given above.  Unrelated Individual An unrelated individual is: (1) a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only, (2) a household member who is not related to the householder, or (3) a person living in group quarters who is not an inmate of an institution.  Family Type A family includes a householder and one or more other people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as part of the householder's family in census tabulations. Thus, the number of family households is equal to the number of families, but family households may include more members than do families. A household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations. Not all households contain families since a household may be comprised of a group of unrelated people or of one person living alone. Families are classified by type as either a ""married-couple family"" or ""other family"" according to the presence of a spouse. ""Other family"" is further broken out according to the sex of the householder. The data on family type are based on answers to questions on sex and relationship that were asked on a 100-percent basis.  Married-couple family This category includes a family in which the householder and his or her spouse are enumerated as members of the same household.  Other family Male householder, no wife present This category includes a family with a male maintaining a household with no wife of the householder present.  Female householder, no husband present This category includes a family with a female maintaining a household with no husband of the householder present.  Nonfamily household This category includes a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only.  Average family size A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in families by the total number of families (or family householders). In cases where this measure is tabulated by race or Hispanic origin, the race or Hispanic origin refers to that of the householder rather than to the race or Hispanic origin 20   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  of each individual. Average family size is rounded to the nearest hundredth.  Subfamily A subfamily is a married couple with or without own children under 18 years old who are nevermarried, or a single parent with one or more own never-married children under 18 years old. A subfamily does not maintain their own household, but lives in a household where the householder or householder's spouse is a relative. Subfamilies are defined during processing of sample data. In some labor force tabulations, both one-parent families and one-parent subfamilies are included in the total number of children living with one parent, while both married-couple families and married-couple subfamilies are included in the total number of children living with two parents.  Unmarried-Partner Household An unmarried-partner household is a household that includes a householder and an ""unmarried partner."" An ""unmarried partner"" can be of the same or of the opposite sex of the householder. An ""unmarried partner"" in an ""unmarried-partner household"" is an adult who is unrelated to the householder, but shares living quarters and has a close personal relationship with the householder. An unmarried-partner household may also be a family household or a nonfamily household, depending on the presence or absence of another person in the household who is related to the householder. There may be only one unmarried-partner per household, and an unmarried partner may not be included in a married-couple household as the householder cannot have both a spouse and an unmarried partner. Comparability. The 1990 relationship category, ""Natural-born or adopted son/daughter"" has been replaced by ""Natural-born son/daughter"" and ""Adopted son/daughter."" The following categories were added in Census 2000: ""Parent-in-law"" and ""Son-in-law/daughter-in-law."" The 1990 nonrelative category, ""Roomer, boarder, or foster child"" was replaced by two categories: ""Roomer, boarder"" and ""Foster child."" In 2000, foster children had to be in the local government's foster care system to be so classified. In 1990, foster children were estimated to be those children in households who were not related to the householder and for whom there were no people 18 years old and over who may have been their parents. In 1990, stepchildren who were adopted by the householder were still classified as stepchildren. In 2000, stepchildren who were legally adopted by the householder were classified as adopted children. Own children shown in 100-percent tabulations may be of any marital status. For comparability with previous censuses, own children shown for sample data are still restricted to nevermarried children. Some tables may show relationship to householder and be labeled ""child."" These tabulations include all marital status categories of natural-born, adopted, or stepchildren. Because of changes in editing procedures, same sex unmarried-partner households in 1990 should not compared with same sex unmarried-partner households in Census 2000.  INCOME IN 1999 The data on income in 1999 were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire items 31 and 32, which were asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. ""Total income"" is the sum of the amounts reported separately for wage or salary income; net self-employment income; interest, dividends, or net rental or royalty income or income from estates and trusts; Social Security or Railroad Retirement income; Supplemental Security Income (SSI); public assistance or welfare payments; retirement, survivor, or disability pensions; and all other income. ""Earnings"" are defined as the sum of wage or salary income and net income from self-employment. ""Earnings"" represent the amount of income received regularly for people 16 years old and over before deductions for personal income taxes, Social 21   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Security, bond purchases, union dues, Medicare deductions, etc. Receipts from the following sources are not included as income: capital gains, money received from the sale of property (unless the recipient was engaged in the business of selling such property); the value of income ""in kind"" from food stamps, public housing subsidies, medical care, employer contributions for individuals, etc.; withdrawal of bank deposits; money borrowed; tax refunds; exchange of money between relatives living in the same household; and gifts and lump-sum inheritances, insurance payments, and other types of lump-sum receipts.  Income Type in 1999 The eight types of income reported in the census are defined as follows:  Wage or salary income Wage or salary income includes total money earnings received for work performed as an employee during the calendar year 1999. It includes wages, salary, Armed Forces pay, commissions, tips, piece-rate payments, and cash bonuses earned before deductions were made for taxes, bonds, pensions, union dues, etc.  Self-employment income Self-employment income includes both farm and nonfarm self-employment income. Nonfarm self-employment income includes net money income (gross receipts minus expenses) from one's own business, professional enterprise, or partnership. Gross receipts include the value of all goods sold and services rendered. Expenses include costs of goods purchased, rent, heat, light, power, depreciation charges, wages and salaries paid, business taxes (not personal income taxes), etc. Farm self-employment income includes net money income (gross receipts minus operating expenses) from the operation of a farm by a person on his or her own account, as an owner, renter, or sharecropper. Gross receipts include the value of all products sold, government farm programs, money received from the rental of farm equipment to others, and incidental receipts from the sale of wood, sand, gravel, etc. Operating expenses include cost of feed, fertilizer, seed, and other farming supplies, cash wages paid to farmhands, depreciation charges, cash rent, interest on farm mortgages, farm building repairs, farm taxes (not state and federal personal income taxes), etc. The value of fuel, food, or other farm products used for family living is not included as part of net income.  Interest, dividends, or net rental income Interest, dividends, or net rental income includes interest on savings or bonds, dividends from stockholdings or membership in associations, net income from rental of property to others and receipts from boarders or lodgers, net royalties, and periodic payments from an estate or trust fund.  Social Security income Social Security income includes Social Security pensions and survivors benefits, permanent disability insurance payments made by the Social Security Administration prior to deductions for medical insurance, and railroad retirement insurance checks from the U.S. Government. Medicare reimbursements are not included.  22   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a nationwide U.S. assistance program administered by the Social Security Administration that guarantees a minimum level of income for needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals. The census questionnaire for Puerto Rico asked about the receipt of SSI; however, SSI is not a federally administered program in Puerto Rico. Therefore, it is probably not being interpreted by most respondents the same as SSI in the United States. The only way a resident of Puerto Rico could have appropriately reported SSI would have been if they lived in the United States at any time during calendar year 1999 and received SSI.  Public assistance income Public assistance income includes general assistance and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). Separate payments received for hospital or other medical care (vendor payments) are excluded. This does not include Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  Retirement income Retirement income includes: (1) retirement pensions and survivor benefits from a former employer; labor union; or federal, state, or local government; and the U.S. military; (2) income from worker's compensation; disability income from companies or unions; federal, state, or local government; and the U.S. military; (3) periodic receipts from annuities and insurance; and (4) regular income from IRA and KEOGH plans. This does not include Social Security income.  All other income All other income includes unemployment compensation, Veterans' Administration (VA) payments, alimony and child support, contributions received periodically from people not living in the household, military family allotments, and other kinds of periodic income other than earnings.  Income of households This includes the income of the householder and all other individuals 15 years old and over in the household, whether they are related to the householder or not. Because many households consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than average family income. Although the household income statistics cover calendar year 1999, the characteristics of individuals and the composition of households refer to the time of enumeration (April 1, 2000). Thus, the income of the household does not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the household during all or part of calendar year 1999 if these individuals no longer resided in the household at the time of enumeration. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did not reside in the household during 1999 but who were members of the household at the time of enumeration are included. However, the composition of most households was the same during 1999 as at the time of enumeration.  Income of families In compiling statistics on family income, the incomes of all members 15 years old and over related to the householder are summed and treated as a single amount. Although the family income statistics cover calendar year 1999, the characteristics of individuals and the composition of families refer to the time of enumeration (April 1, 2000). Thus, the income of the family does not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the family during all or part of calendar year 1999 if these individuals no longer resided with the family at the time of enumeration. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did not reside with the 23   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  family during 1999 but who were members of the family at the time of enumeration are included. However, the composition of most families was the same during 1999 as at the time of enumeration.  Income of individuals Income for individuals is obtained by summing the eight types of income for each person 15 years old and over. The characteristics of individuals are based on the time of enumeration (April 1, 2000), even though the amounts are for calendar year 1999.  Median income The median divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median income and one-half above the median. For households and families, the median income is based on the distribution of the total number of households and families including those with no income. The median income for individuals is based on individuals 15 years old and over with income. Median income for households, families, and individuals is computed on the basis of a standard distribution (see the ""Standard Distributions"" section under ""Derived Measures""). Median income is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Median income figures are calculated using linear interpolation if the width of the interval containing the estimate is $2,500 or less. If the width of the interval containing the estimate is greater than $2,500, Pareto interpolation is used. (For more information on medians and interpolation, see ""Derived Measures."")  Aggregate income Aggregate income is the sum of all incomes for a particular universe. Aggregate income is subject to rounding, which means that all cells in a matrix are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. (For more information, see ""Aggregate"" under ""Derived Measures."")  Mean income Mean income is the amount obtained by dividing the aggregate income of a particular statistical universe by the number of units in that universe. Thus, mean household income is obtained by dividing total household income by the total number of households. (The aggregate used to calculate mean income is rounded. For more information, see ""Aggregate income."") For the various types of income, the means are based on households having those types of income. For households and families, the mean income is based on the distribution of the total number of households and families including those with no income. The mean income for individuals is based on individuals 15 years old and over with income. Mean income is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Care should be exercised in using and interpreting mean income values for small subgroups of the population. Because the mean is influenced strongly by extreme values in the distribution, it is especially susceptible to the effects of sampling variability, misreporting, and processing errors. The median, which is not affected by extreme values, is, therefore, a better measure than the mean when the population base is small. The mean, nevertheless, is shown in some data products for most small subgroups because, when weighted according to the number of cases, the means can be added to obtained summary measures for areas and groups other than those shown in census tabulations. (For more information on means, see ""Derived Measures."")  24   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Earnings Earnings are defined as the sum of wage or salary income and net income from self-employment. ""Earnings"" represent the amount of income received regularly for people 16 years old and over before deductions for personal income taxes, Social Security, bond purchases, union dues, Medicare deductions, etc.  Median earnings The median divides the earnings distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median earnings and one-half above the median. Median earnings is restricted to individuals 16 years old and over and is computed on the basis of a standard distribution (see the ""Standard Distributions"" section under ""Derived Measures""). Median earnings figures are calculated using linear interpolation if the width of the interval containing the estimate is $2,500 or less. If the width of the interval containing the estimate is greater than $2,500, Pareto interpolation is used. (For more information on medians and interpolation, see ""Derived Measures."")  Aggregate earnings Aggregate earnings are the sum of wage/salary and net self-employment income for a particular universe of people 16 years old and over. Aggregate earnings are subject to rounding, which means that all cells in a matrix are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. (For more information, see ""Aggregate"" under ""Derived Measures."")  Mean earnings Mean earnings is calculated by dividing aggregate earnings by the population 16 years old and over with earnings. (The aggregate used to calculate mean earnings is rounded. For more information, see ""Aggregate earnings."") Mean earnings is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. (For more information on means, see ""Derived Measures."")  Per capita income Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group. It is derived by dividing the total income of a particular group by the total population in that group. (The aggregate used to calculate per capita income is rounded. For more information, see ""Aggregate"" under ""Derived Measures."") Per capita income is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. (For more information on means, see ""Derived Measures."") Limitation of the data. Since answers to income questions are frequently based on memory and not on records, many people tended to forget minor or sporadic sources of income and, therefore, underreport their income. Underreporting tends to be more pronounced for income sources that are not derived from earnings, such as public assistance, interest, dividends, and net rental income. Extensive computer editing procedures were instituted in the data processing operation to reduce some of these reporting errors and to improve the accuracy of the income data. These procedures corrected various reporting deficiencies and improved the consistency of reported income items associated with work experience and information on occupation and class of worker. For example, if people reported they were self employed on their own farm, not incorporated, but had reported wage and salary earnings only, the latter amount was shifted to self-employment income. Also, if any respondent reported total income only, the amount was generally assigned to one of the types of income items according to  25   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  responses to the work experience and class-of-worker questions. Another type of problem involved nonreporting of income data. Where income information was not reported, procedures were devised to impute appropriate values with either no income or positive or negative dollar amounts for the missing entries. (For more information on imputation, see ""Accuracy of the Data."") In income tabulations for households and families, the lowest income group (for example, less than $10,000) includes units that were classified as having no 1999 income. Many of these were living on income ""in kind,"" savings, or gifts, were newly created families, or were families in which the sole breadwinner had recently died or left the household. However, many of the households and families who reported no income probably had some money income which was not reported in the census. Comparability. The income data collected in the 1970, 1980 and 1990 censuses are similar to Census 2000 data, but there are variations in the detail of the questions. In 1990, income information for 1989 was collected from people in approximately 17 percent of all housing units and group quarters. Each person 15 years old and over was required to report:         Wage or salary income Net nonfarm self-employment income Net farm self-employment income Interest, dividend, or net rental or royalty income Social Security or Railroad Retirement income Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or other public assistance income Retirement, survivor, or disability income Income from all other sources  Since the number of respondents reporting farm self-employment income has become smaller over the years, the farm and non-farm self-employment items were combined into one item for Census 2000. Data users are still able to obtain an estimate of ""farm self-employment"" income by looking at net selfemployment income in combination with other labor force related questions such as ""occupation of longest job."" Supplemental Security Income (SSI) was asked separately from other public assistance income or welfare received from a state or local welfare office in Census 2000. Between the 1990 census and Census 2000, there were minor differences in the processing of the data. In both censuses, all people with missing values in one or more of the detailed type of income items were designated as allocated. Each missing entry was imputed either as a ""no"" or as a dollar amount. If total income was reported and one or more of the type of income fields was not answered, then the entry in total income generally was assigned to one of the income types according to the socioeconomic characteristics of the income recipient. This person was designated as unallocated. In 2000 and 1990, all non-respondents with income not reported (whether householders or other people) were assigned the reported income of people with similar characteristics. (For more information on imputation, see ""Accuracy of the Data."") In 1980, income information for 1979 was collected from people in approximately 19 percent of all housing units and group quarters. Each person 15 years old and over was required to report:   Wage or salary income Net nonfarm self-employment income 26   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000        Net farm self-employment income Interest, dividend, or net rental or royalty income Social Security or Railroad Retirement income Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or other public assistance income Income from all other sources  There was a difference in the method of computer derivation of aggregate income from individual amounts. In the 1980 census, income amounts less than $100,000 were coded in tens of dollars, and amounts of $100,000 or more were coded in thousands of dollars; $5 was added to each amount coded in tens of dollars and $500 to each amount coded in thousands of dollars. Entries of $999,000 or more were treated as $999,500 and losses of $9,999 or more were treated as minus $9,999. In the 1990 and 2000 censuses, income amounts less than $999,999 were keyed to the nearest dollar. Amounts of $999,999 or more were treated as $999,999 and losses of $9,999 or more were treated as minus $9,999 in all of the computer derivations of aggregate income. In 1970, information on income in 1969 was obtained from all members in every fifth housing unit 14 years old and over and small group quarters (less than 15 people) and every fifth person in all other group quarters. Each person 14 years old and over was required to report:       Wage or salary income Net nonfarm self-employment income Net farm self-employment income Social Security or Railroad Retirement income Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or other public assistance income Income from all other sources  If a person reported a dollar amount in wage or salary, net nonfarm self-employment income, or net farm self-employment income, the person was considered as unallocated only if no further dollar amounts were imputed for any additional missing entries. In 1960, unit and required received received who had data on income were obtained from all members 14 years old and over in every fourth housing from every fourth person 14 years old and over living in group quarters. Each person was to report wage or salary income, net self-employment income, and income other than earnings in 1959. An assumption was made in the editing process that no other type of income was by a person who reported the receipt of either wage and salary income or self-employment but failed to report the receipt of other money income.  For several reasons, the income data shown in census tabulations are not directly comparable with those that may be obtained from statistical summaries of income tax returns. Income, as defined for federal tax purposes, differs somewhat from the Census Bureau concept. Moreover, the coverage of income tax statistics is different because of the exemptions of people having small amounts of income and the inclusion of net capital gains in tax returns. Furthermore, members of some families file separate returns and others file joint returns; consequently, the income reporting unit is not consistently either a family or a person. The earnings data shown in census tabulations are not directly comparable with earnings records of the Social Security Administration. The earnings record data for 1999 excluded the earnings of some civilian 27   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  government employees, some employees of nonprofit organizations, workers covered by the Railroad Retirement Act, and people not covered by the program because of insufficient earnings. Because census data are obtained from household questionnaires, they may differ from Social Security Administration earnings record data, which are based upon employers' reports and the federal income tax returns of self-employed people. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce publishes annual data on aggregate and per-capita personal income received by the population for states, metropolitan areas, and selected counties. Aggregate income estimates based on the income statistics shown in census products usually would be less than those shown in the BEA income series for several reasons. The Census Bureau data are obtained directly from households, whereas the BEA income series is estimated largely on the basis of data from administrative records of business and governmental sources. Moreover, the definitions of income are different. The BEA income series includes some items not included in the income data shown in census publications, such as income ""in kind,"" income received by nonprofit institutions, the value of services of banks and other financial intermediaries rendered to people without the assessment of specific charges, Medicare payments, and the income of people who died or emigrated prior to April 1, 2000. On the other hand, the census income data include contributions for support received from people not residing in the same household if the income is received on a regular basis. In comparing income data for 1999 with earlier years, it should be noted that an increase or decrease in money income does not necessarily represent a comparable change in real income, unless adjustments for changes in prices are made.  INDUSTRY, OCCUPATION, AND CLASS OF WORKER The data on questionnaire old and over. organization; industry, occupation, and class of worker were derived from answers to long-form items 27, 28, and 29 respectively, which were asked of a sample of the population 15 years Information on industry relates to the kind of business conducted by a person's employing occupation describes the kind of work a person does on the job.  For employed people, the data refer to the person's job during the reference week. For those who worked at two or more jobs, the data refer to the job at which the person worked the greatest number of hours during the reference week. For unemployed people, the data refer to their last job. The industry and occupation statistics are derived from the detailed classification systems developed for Census 2000 as described below. Respondents provided the data for the tabulations by writing on the questionnaires descriptions of their industry and occupation. These descriptions were data captured and sent to an automated coder (computer software), which assigned a portion of the written entries to categories in the classification system. The automated system assigned codes to 59 percent of the industry entries and 56 percent of the occupation entries. Those cases not coded by the computer were referred to clerical staff in the Census Bureau's National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana, for coding. The clerical staff converted the written questionnaire responses to codes by comparing these responses to entries in the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations. For the industry code, these coders also referred to an Employer Name List. This list, prepared from the American Business Index (ABI), contained the names of business establishments and their North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes converted to population census equivalents. This list facilitated coding and maintained industrial classification comparability.  28   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Industry The industry classification system used during Census 2000 was developed for the census and consists of 265 categories for employed people, classified into 14 major industry groups. From 1940 through 1990, the industrial classification has been based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual. The Census 2000 classification was developed from the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) published by the Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President. NAICS is an industry description system that groups establishments into industries based on the activities in which they are primarily engaged. The NAICS differs from most industry classifications because it is a supply-based or productionoriented economic concept. Census data, which were collected from households, differ in detail and nature from those obtained from establishment surveys. Therefore, the census classification system, while defined in NAICS terms, cannot reflect the full detail in all categories. NAICS shows a more detailed hierarchical structure than that used for Census 2000. The expansion from 11 divisions in the SIC to 20 sectors in the NAICS provides groupings that are meaningful and useful for economic analysis. Various statistical programs that previously sampled or published at the SIC levels face problems with the coverage for 20 sectors instead of 11 divisions. These programs requested an alternative aggregation structure for production purposes which was approved and issued by the Office of Management and Budget on May 15, 2001, in the clarification Memorandum No. 2, ""NAICS Alternate Aggregation Structure for Use by U.S. Statistical Agencies."" Several census data products will use the alternative aggregation, while others, such as Summary File 3 and Summary File 4, will use more detail.  Occupation The occupational classification system used during Census 2000 consists of 509 specific occupational categories for employed people arranged into 23 major occupational groups. This classification was developed based on the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual: 2000, which includes a hierarchical structure showing 23 major occupational groups divided into 96 minor groups, 449 broad groups, and 821 detailed occupations. For Census 2000, tabulations with occupation as the primary characteristic present several levels of occupational detail. Some occupation groups are related closely to certain industries. Operators of transportation equipment, farm operators and workers, and healthcare providers account for major portions of their respective industries of transportation, agriculture, and health care. However, the industry categories include people in other occupations. For example, people employed in agriculture include truck drivers and bookkeepers; people employed in the transportation industry include mechanics, freight handlers, and payroll clerks; and people employed in the health care industry include occupations such as security guard, and secretary.  Class of Worker The data on class of worker were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 29. The information on class of worker refers to the same job as a respondent's industry and occupation, categorizing people according to the type of ownership of the employing organization. The class of worker categories are defined as follows:  Private wage and salary workers Private wage and salary workers include people who worked for wages, salary, commission,  29   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  tips, pay-in-kind, or piece rates for a private-for-profit employer or a private not-for-profit, tax-exempt, or charitable organization. Self-employed people whose business was incorporated are included with private wage and salary workers because they are paid employees of their own companies. Some tabulations present data separately for these subcategories: ""for-profit,"" ""notfor-profit,"" and ""own business incorporated.""  Government workers Government workers include people who were employees of any federal, tribal, state, or local governmental unit, regardless of the activity of the particular agency. For some tabulations, the data were presented separately for federal (includes tribal), state, and local governments. Employees of foreign governments, the United Nations, or other formal international organizations were classified as ""federal government,"" unlike the 1990 census when they were classified as ""private not-for-profit.""  Self-employed in own not incorporated business workers Self-employed in own not incorporated business workers includes people who worked for profit or fees in their own unincorporated business, professional practice, or trade, or who operated a farm.  Unpaid family workers Unpaid family workers includes people who worked 15 hours or more without pay in a business or on a farm operated by a relative.  Self-employed in own incorporated business workers In tabulations, this category is included with private wage and salary workers because they are paid employees of their own companies. The industry category, ""Public administration,"" is limited to regular government functions such as legislative, judicial, administrative, and regulatory activities of governments. Other government organizations such as schools, hospitals, liquor stores, and bus lines are classified by industry according to the activity in which they are engaged. On the other hand, the class of worker government categories include all government workers. In some cases, respondents supplied industry, occupation, or class of worker descriptions which were not sufficiently specific for a precise classification or did not report on these items at all. In the coding operation, certain types of incomplete entries were corrected using the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations. For example, it was possible in certain situations to assign an industry code based on the occupation reported, or vice versa. Following the coding operations, there was a computer edit and an allocation process. The edit first determined whether a respondent was in the universe which required an industry and occupation code. The codes for the three items (industry, occupation, and class of worker) were checked to ensure they were valid and were edited for their relation to each other. Invalid and inconsistent codes were either blanked or changed to a consistent code. If one or based on the labor person or more of the three codes was blank after the edit, a code was assigned from a ""similar"" person other items such as age, sex, education, farm or nonfarm residence, and weeks worked. If all of force and income data were blank, all of these economic items were assigned from one other one other household who provided all the necessary data. 30   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Comparability. Comparability of industry and occupation data was affected by a number of factors, primarily the systems used to classify the questionnaire responses. For both the industry and occupation classification systems, the basic structures were generally the same from 1940 to 1970, but changes in the individual categories limited comparability of the data from one census to another. These changes were needed to recognize the ""birth"" of new industries and occupations, the ""death"" of others, the growth and decline in existing industries and occupations, and the desire of analysts and other users for more detail in the presentation of the data. Probably the greatest cause of noncomparability is the movement of a segment of a category to a different category in the next census. Changes in the nature of jobs and respondent terminology, and refinement of category composition made these movements necessary. The 1990 occupational classification system was essentially the same as the 1980 census. However, the industry classification had minor changes between 1980 and 1990 that reflected changes to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). In Census 2000, both the industry and occupation classifications had major revisions to reflect changes to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). The conversion of the census classifications in 2000 means that the 2000 classification systems are not comparable to the classifications used in the 1990 census and earlier. Other factors that affected data comparability over the decades include the universe to which the data referred (in 1970, the age cutoff for labor force was changed from 14 years old to 16 years old); the wording of the industry and occupation questions on the questionnaire (for example, important changes were made in 1970); improvements in the coding procedures (the Employer Name List technique was introduced in 1960); and how the ""not reported"" cases were handled. Prior to 1970, they were placed in the residual categories, ""industry not reported"" and ""occupation not reported."" In 1970, an allocation process was introduced that assigned these cases to major groups. In Census 2000, as in 1980 and 1990, the ""not reported"" cases were assigned to individual categories. Therefore, the 1980, 1990, and Census 2000 data for individual categories include some numbers of people who would have been tabulated in a ""not reported"" category in previous censuses. The following publications contain information on the various factors affecting comparability and are particularly useful for understanding differences in the occupation and industry information from earlier censuses: U.S. Bureau of the Census, Changes Between the 1950 and 1960 Occupation and Industry Classifications With Detailed Adjustments of 1950 Data to the 1960 Classifications, Technical Paper No. 18, 1968; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970 Occupation and Industry Classification Systems in Terms of their 1960 Occupation and Industry Elements, Technical Paper No. 26, 1972; and U.S. Bureau of the Census, The Relationship between the 1970 and 1980 Industry and Occupation Classification Systems, Technical Paper No. 59, 1988. For citations for earlier census years, see the 1980 Census of Population report, PC80-1-D, Detailed Population Characteristics. The 1990 census introduced an additional class of worker category for ""private not-for-profit"" employers, which is also used for Census 2000. This category is a subset of the 1980 category ""employee of private employer"" so there is no comparable data before 1990. Also in 1990, employees of foreign governments, the United Nations, etc., were classified as ""private not-for-profit,"" rather than ""Federal Government"" as in 1970, 1980, and Census 2000. While in theory, there was a change in comparability, in practice, the small number of U.S. residents working for foreign governments made this change negligible. Comparability between the statistics on industry and occupation from Census 2000 and statistics from other sources is affected by many of the factors described in the ""Employment Status"" section. These  31   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  factors are primarily geographic differences between residence and place of work, different dates of reference, and differences in counts because of dual job holdings. Industry data from population censuses cover all industries and all kinds of workers, whereas, data from establishments often exclude private household workers, government workers, and the self employed. Also, the replies from household respondents may have differed in detail and nature from those obtained from establishments. Occupation data from the census and data from government licensing agencies, professional associations, trade unions, etc., may not be as comparable as expected. Organizational listings often include people not in the labor force or people devoting all or most of their time to another occupation; or the same person may be included in two or more different listings. In addition, relatively few organizations, except for those requiring licensing, attained complete coverage of membership in a particular occupational field.  JOURNEY TO WORK Place of Work The data on place of work were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 22, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week. (For more information, see ""Reference Week."") Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. Data on place of work refer to the geographic location at which workers carried out their occupational activities during the reference week. The exact address (number and street name) of the place of work was asked, as well as the place (city, town, or post office); whether or not the place of work was inside or outside the limits of that city or town; and the county, state or foreign country, and ZIP Code. If the person's employer operated in more than one location, the exact address of the location or branch where the respondent worked was requested. When the number and street name were unknown, a description of the location, such as the building name or nearest street or intersection, was to be entered. In areas where the workplace address was coded to the block level, people were tabulated as working inside or outside a specific place based on the location of that address, regardless of the response to question 22c concerning city/town limits. In areas where it was impossible to code the workplace address to the block level, people were tabulated as working in a place if a place name was reported in question 22b and the response to question 22c was either ""yes"" or the item was left blank. In selected areas, census designated places (CDPs) may appear in the tabulations as places of work. The accuracy of place-of-work data for CDPs may be affected by the extent to which their census names were familiar to respondents, and by coding problems caused by similarities between the CDP name and the names of other geographic jurisdictions in the same vicinity. Place-of-work data are given for minor civil divisions (MCDs) (generally, cities, towns, and townships) in 12 selected states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin), based on the responses to the place-of-work question. The MCDs in these 12 states also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for the MCDs in all data products in which it provides data for places. Many towns and townships are regarded locally as  32   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  equivalent to a place, and therefore, were reported as the place of work. When a respondent reported a locality or incorporated place that formed a part of a township or town, the coding and tabulating procedure was designed to include the response in the total for the township or town. Limitation of the data. The data on place of work relate to a reference week; that is, the calendar week preceding the date on which the respondents completed their questionnaires or were interviewed by enumerators. This week is not the same for all respondents because the enumeration was not completed in one week. However, for the majority of people, the reference week for Census 2000 is the week ending with April 1, 2000. The lack of a uniform reference week means that the place-of-work data reported in Census 2000 do not exactly match the distribution of workplace locations observed or measured during an actual work week. The place-of-work data are estimates of people 16 years old and over who were both employed and at work during the reference week (including people in the Armed Forces). People who did not work during the reference week but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons are not included in the place-of-work data. Therefore, the data on place of work understate the total number of jobs or total employment in a geographic area during the reference week. It also should be noted that people who had irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs during the reference week may have erroneously reported themselves as not working. The address where the individual worked most often during the reference week was recorded on the Census 2000 questionnaire. If a worker held two jobs, only data about the primary job (the one worked the greatest number of hours during the preceding week) was requested. People who regularly worked in several locations during the reference week were requested to give the address at which they began work each day. For cases in which daily work was not begun at a central place each day, the person was asked to provide as much information as possible to describe the area in which he or she worked most during the reference week. Comparability. The wording of the question Census 2000, the 1990 census, and the 1980 Census 2000 and the 1990 census are based on census were based on only about one-half of the on place of work was substantially the same in census. However, data on place of work from the full census sample, while data from the 1980 full sample.  For the 1980 census, nonresponse or incomplete responses to the place-of-work question were not allocated, resulting in the use of ""not reported"" categories in the 1980 publications. However, for Census 2000 and the 1990 census, when place of work was not reported or the response was incomplete, a work location was allocated to the person based on their means of transportation to work, travel time to work, industry, and location of residence and workplace of others. Census 2000 and 1990 census tabulations, therefore, do not contain a ""not reported"" category for the place-of-work data. Comparisons between 1980, 1990, or Census 2000 data on the gross number of workers in particular commuting flows, or the total number of people working in an area, should be made with extreme caution. Any apparent increase in the magnitude of the gross numbers may be due solely to the fact that for Census 2000 and the 1990 census, the ""not reported"" cases have been distributed among specific place-of-work destinations, instead of tallied in a separate category, as  33   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  in 1980.  Means of Transportation to Work The data on means of transportation to work were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 23a, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week. (For more information, see ""Reference Week."") Means of transportation to work refers to the principal mode of travel or type of conveyance that the worker usually used to get from home to work during the reference week. Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. People who used different means of transportation on different days of the week were asked to specify the one they used most often, that is, the greatest number of days. People who used more than one means of transportation to get to work each day were asked to report the one used for the longest distance during the work trip. The category ""Car, truck, or van -- drove alone"" includes people who usually drove alone to work, as well as people who were driven to work by someone who then drove back home or to a nonwork destination during the reference week. The category ""Car, truck, or van -- carpooled"" include workers who reported that two or more people usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. The category ""Public transportation"" includes workers who usually used a bus or trolley bus, streetcar or trolley car, subway or elevated, railroad, ferryboat, or taxicab during the reference week. Pblico is included in the ""Public transportation"" category in Puerto Rico. The category ""Other means"" includes workers who used a mode of travel which is not identified separately. The category ""Other means"" may vary from table to table, depending on the amount of detail shown in a particular distribution. The means of transportation data for some areas may show workers using modes of public transportation that are not available in those areas (for example, subway or elevated riders in a metropolitan area where there actually is no subway or elevated service). This result is largely due to people who worked during the reference week at a location that was different from their usual place of work (such as people away from home on business in an area where subway service was available) and people who used more than one means of transportation each day but whose principal means was unavailable where they lived (for example, residents of nonmetropolitan areas who drove to the fringe of a metropolitan area and took the commuter railroad most of the distance to work).  Private Vehicle Occupancy The data on private vehicle occupancy were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 23b, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in question 23a that their means of transportation to work was ""Car, truck, or van."" (For more information, see ""Reference Week."") Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. Private vehicle occupancy refers to the number of people who usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. The category ""Drove alone,"" includes people who usually drove alone to work as well as people who were driven to work by someone who then drove back home or to 34   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  a nonwork destination. The category ""Carpooled,"" includes workers who reported that two or more people usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week.  Workers per car, truck, or van This is obtained by dividing the number of people who reported using a car, truck, or van to get to work by the number of such vehicles that they used. The number of vehicles used is derived by counting each person who drove alone as one vehicle, each person who reported being in a two-person carpool as one-half of a vehicle, each person who reported being in a three-person carpool as one-third of a vehicle, and so on, and then summing all the vehicles. Workers per car, truck, or van is rounded to the nearest hundredth.  Time Leaving Home to Go to Work The data on time leaving home to go to work were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 24a, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in question 23a that they worked outside their home. The departure time refers to the time of day that the person usually left home to go to work during the reference week. (For more information, see ""Reference Week."") Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week.  Travel Time to Work The data on travel time to work were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 24b, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. This question was asked of people who indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in question 23a that they worked outside their home. Travel time to work refers to the total number of minutes that it usually took the person to get from home to work each day during the reference week. The elapsed time includes time spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. (For more information, see ""Reference Week."") Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over; that is, members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week.  Aggregate travel time to work (minutes) Aggregate travel time to work (minutes) is calculated by adding together all the number of minutes each worker traveled to work (one way) for specified travel times and/or means of transportation. Aggregate travel time to work is zero if the aggregate is zero, is rounded to four minutes if the actual aggregate is one to seven minutes, and is rounded to the nearest multiple of five minutes for all other values (if the aggregate is not already evenly divisible by five). (For more information, see ""Aggregate"" under ""Derived Measures."")  Mean travel time to work (minutes) Mean travel time to work is the average travel time in minutes that workers usually took to get from home to work (one way) during the reference week. This measure is obtained by dividing the total number of minutes taken to get from home to work by the number of workers 16 years old and over who did not work at home. The travel time includes time spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. Mean travel times of workers having specific characteristics also are computed.  35   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  For example, the mean travel time of workers traveling 45 or more minutes is computed by dividing the aggregate travel time of workers whose travel time was 45 or more minutes by the number of workers whose travel time was 45 or more minutes. Mean travel time to work is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on means, see ""Derived Measures."")  POVERTY STATUS IN 1999 The poverty data were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire items 31 and 32, the same questions used to derive income data. (For more information, see ""Income in 1999."") The Census Bureau uses the federal government's official poverty definition. The Social Security Administration (SSA) developed the original poverty definition in 1964, which federal interagency committees subsequently revised in 1969 and 1980. The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Directive 14 prescribes this definition as the official poverty measure for federal agencies to use in their statistical work.  Derivation of the Current Poverty Measure When the Social Security Administration (SSA) created the poverty definition in 1964, it focused on family food consumption. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) used its data about the nutritional needs of children and adults to construct food plans for families. Within each food plan, dollar amounts varied according to the total number of people in the family and the family's composition, such as the number of children within each family. The cheapest of these plans, the Economy Food Plan, was designed to address the dietary needs of families on an austere budget. Since the USDA's 1955 Food Consumption Survey showed that families of three or more people across all income levels spent roughly one-third of their income on food, the SSA multiplied the cost of the Economy Food Plan by three to obtain dollar figures for the poverty thresholds. Since the Economy Food Plan budgets varied by family size and composition, so too did the poverty thresholds. For two person families, the thresholds were adjusted by slightly higher factors because those households had higher fixed costs. Thresholds for unrelated individuals were calculated as a fixed proportion of the corresponding thresholds for two person families. The poverty thresholds are revised annually to allow for changes in the cost of living as reflected in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The poverty thresholds are the same for all parts of the country -- they are not adjusted for regional, state or local variations in the cost of living. For a detailed discussion of the poverty definition, see U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Reports, ""Poverty in the United States: 1999,"" P-60-210.  How Poverty Status is Determined The poverty status of families and unrelated individuals in 1999 was determined using 48 thresholds (income cutoffs) arranged in a two dimensional matrix. The matrix consists of family size (from one person to nine or more people) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to eight or more children present). Unrelated individuals and two-person families were further differentiated by the age of the reference person (RP) (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over). To determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person's total family income with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition (see table below). If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered poor, together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. 36   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Weighted average thresholds Even though the official poverty data are based on the 48 thresholds arranged by family size and number of children within the family, data users often want to get an idea of the ""average"" threshold for a given family size. The weighted average thresholds provide that summary. They are weighted averages because for any given family size, families with a certain number of children may be more or less common than families with a different number of children. In other words, among three-person families, there are more families with two adults and one child than families with three adults. To get the weighted average threshold for families of a particular size, multiply each threshold by the number of families for whom that threshold applies; then add up those products, and divide by the total number of families who are of that family size. For example, for three-person families, 1999 weighted thresholds were calculated in the following way using information from the 2000 Current Population Survey: Family type no children (three adults) one child (two adults) two children (one adult) Totals Number of families 5,213 8,208 2,656 16,077 * * * Threshold $13,032 = $67,935,816 $13,410 = $110,069,280 $13,423 = $35,651,488 $213,656,584  Source: Current Population Survey, March 2000. Dividing $213,656,584 by 16,077 weighted average threshold for weighted not just by the number apply: the thresholds are used to below poverty. (the total number of three-person families) yields $13,290, the three-person families. Please note that the thresholds are of poor families, but by all families for which the thresholds determine which families are at or above poverty, as well as  Individuals for whom poverty status is determined Poverty status was determined for all people except institutionalized people, people in military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15 years old. These groups also were excluded from the numerator and denominator when calculating poverty rates. They are considered neither ""poor"" nor ""nonpoor.""  Specified poverty levels For various reasons, the official poverty definition does not satisfy all the needs of data users. Therefore, some of the data reflect the number of people below different percentages of the poverty level. These specified poverty levels are obtained by multiplying the official thresholds by the appropriate factor. For example, the average income cutoff at 125 percent of the poverty level was $21,286 ($17,029 x 1.25) in 1999 for family of four people.  37   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Poverty Threshold in 1999, by Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years Old (Dollars) Related children under 18 years old Size of family unit Weighted average threshold None One One person (unrelated 8501 individual) Under 65 years old 8667 65 years and over old 7990 and over Two people 10869 Householder under 65 11214 years old Householder 65 years old and over 10075 Three people Four people Five people Six people Seven people Eight people Nine people or more 13290 17029 20127 22727 25912 28967 34417 Two Three Four Five Six Eight Seven or More  8667 7990  11156 11483 10070 11440 13032 17184 20723 23835 27425 30673 36897 13410 17465 21024 23930 27596 30944 37076 13423 16895 20380 23436 27006 30387 36583  16954 19882 22964 26595 29899 36169  19578 22261 25828 29206 35489  21845 24934 23953 28327 27412 27180 34554 33708 33499 32208  Income deficit Income deficit represents the difference between the total income of families and unrelated individuals below the poverty level and their respective poverty thresholds. In computing the income deficit, families reporting a net income loss are assigned zero dollars and for such cases the deficit is equal to the poverty threshold. This measure provides an estimate of the amount which would be required to raise the incomes of all poor families and unrelated individuals to their respective poverty thresholds. The income deficit is thus a measure of the degree of the impoverishment of a family or unrelated individual. However, please use caution when comparing the average deficits of families with different characteristics. Apparent differences in average income deficits may, to some extent, be a function of differences in family size.  Aggregate income deficit Aggregate income deficit refers only to those families or unrelated individuals who are classified as below the poverty level. It is defined as the group (e.g., type of family) sum total of 38   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  differences between the appropriate threshold and total family income or total personal income. Aggregate income deficit is subject to rounding, which means that all cells in a matrix are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. (For more information, see ""Aggregate"" under ""Derived Measures."")  Mean income deficit Mean income deficit represents the amount obtained by dividing the total income deficit for a group below the poverty level by the number of families (or unrelated individuals) in that group. (The aggregate used to calculate mean income deficit is rounded. For more information, see ""Aggregate income deficit."") As mentioned above, please use caution when comparing mean income deficits of families with different characteristics, as apparent differences may to some extent be a function of differences in family size. Mean income deficit is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. (For more information on means, see ""Derived Measures."") Comparability. The poverty definition used in the 1980 census and later differed slightly from the one used in the 1970 census. Three technical modifications were made to the definition used in the 1970 census: 1. Beginning with the 1980 census, the Office of Management and Budget eliminated any distinction between thresholds for ""families with a female householder with no husband present"" and all other families. The new thresholds -- which apply to all families regardless of the householder's sex -- were a weighted average of the old thresholds. 2. The Office of Management and Budget eliminated any differences between farm families and nonfarm families, and farm and nonfarm unrelated individuals. In the 1970 census, the farm thresholds were 85 percent of those for nonfarm families, whereas in 1980 and later the same thresholds were applied to all families and unrelated individuals regardless of residence. 3. The thresholds by size of family were extended from seven or more people in 1970 to nine or more people in 1980 and later. These changes resulted in a minimal increase in the number of poor at the national level. For a complete discussion of these modifications and their impact, see U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Reports, ""Characteristics of the Population Below the Poverty Level: 1980,"" P-60, No. 133. With respect to poverty, the population covered in the 1970 census was almost the same as that covered in the 1980 census and later. The only difference was that in 1980 and after, unrelated individuals under 15 years old were excluded from the poverty universe, while in 1970, only those under age 14 were excluded. The limited poverty data from the 1960 census excluded all people in group quarters and included all unrelated individuals regardless of age. It was unlikely that these differences in population coverage would have had significant impact when comparing the poverty data for people since the 1960 census.  Household poverty data Poverty status is not defined for households  only for families and unrelated individuals. Because some data users need poverty data at the household level, we have provided a few matrices which show tallies of households by the poverty status of the householder. In these matrices, the householder's poverty status is computed exactly the same way as described above. Therefore, to determine whether or not a ""household"" was in poverty, anyone who is not related 39   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  to the householder is ignored. Example #1: Household #1 has six membersa married couple, Alice and Albert, with their 10year-old nephew, Aaron, and another married couple, Brian and Beatrice, with their 6-year-old son, Ben. Alice is the householder. Brian, Beatrice, and Ben are not related to Alice. Household member Alice Albert Aaron Brian Beatrice Ben Relationship to Alice self (householder) spouse related child unrelated individual unrelated individual unrelated individual Income $ $ $ $ $ $ 5,000 40,000 0 0 5,000 0  The total income of Alice's family is $45,000, and their poverty threshold is $13,410, since there are three people in the family, with one member under age 18. Their income is greater than their threshold, so they are not classified as poor. Their ratio of income to poverty is 3.36 ($45,000 divided by $13,410). Alice's income-to-poverty ratio is also 3.36, because everyone in the same family has the same poverty status. Even though Brian, Beatrice and Ben would be classified as poor if they lived in their own household, the household is not classified as poor because the householder, Alice, is not poor, as was shown in the computation above. Example #2: Household #2 consists of four adults, Claude, Danielle, Emily and Francis, who are unrelated to each other and are living as housemates. Claude, who is age 30, is the householder. Household member Claude Danielle Emily Francis Relationship to Claude Income self (householder) unrelated individual unrelated individual unrelated individual $ $ $ $ 4,500 82,000 28,000 40,000  Because Claude is under age 65 and is not living with any family members, his poverty threshold is $8,667. Since his income, $4,500, is less than his threshold, he is considered poor. His ratio of income to poverty is 0.52 ($4,500 divided by $8,667). Household #2 would be classified as poor because its householder, Claude, is poor, even though the other household members (who are not related to Claude) are not in poverty.  RACE The data on race, which was asked of all people, were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 6 and short-form questionnaire Item 8. The concept of race, as used by the Census Bureau, reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify. These categories are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. Furthermore, the race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.  40   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  The racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice entitled, ""Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity,"" issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. The OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a sixth category, ""Some other race,"" added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, the OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races. If an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were assigned using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or the spouse of the householder were assigned. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, the race or races of a householder in a previously processed household were assigned. This procedure is a variation of the general imputation procedures described in ""Accuracy of the Data.""  White A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as ""White"" or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.  Black or African American A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as ""Black, African Am., or Negro,"" or provide written entries such as African American, Afro-American, Kenyan, Nigerian, or Haitian.  American Indian or Alaska Native A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment. It includes people who classified themselves as described below.  American Indian This category includes people who indicated their race as ""American Indian,"" entered the name of an Indian tribe, or reported such entries as Canadian Indian, French American Indian, or Spanish American Indian.  American Indian tribe Respondents who identified themselves as American Indian were asked to report their enrolled or principal tribe. Therefore, tribal data in tabulations reflect the written entries reported on the questionnaires. Some of the entries (for example, Iroquois, Sioux, Colorado River, and Flathead) represent nations or reservations. The information on tribe is based on self-identification and therefore does not reflect any designation of federally- or state-recognized tribe. Information on American Indian tribes is presented in summary files. The information for Census 2000 is derived from the American Indian Tribal Classification List for the 1990 census that was updated based on a December 1997, Federal Register Notice, entitled ""Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Service From the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs,"" Department of the  41   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, issued by the Office of Management and Budget.  Alaska Native This category includes written responses of Eskimos, Aleuts, and Alaska Indians as well as entries such as Arctic Slope, Inupiat, Yupik, Alutiiq, Egegik, and Pribilovian. The Alaska tribes are the Alaskan Athabascan, Tlingit, and Haida. The information for Census 2000 is based on the American Indian Tribal Classification List for the 1990 census, which was expanded to list the individual Alaska Native Villages when provided as a written response for race.  Asian A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. It includes ""Asian Indian,"" ""Chinese,"" ""Filipino,"" ""Korean,"" ""Japanese,"" ""Vietnamese,"" and ""Other Asian.""  Asian Indian This category includes people who indicated their race as ""Asian Indian"" or identified themselves as Bengalese, Bharat, Dravidian, East Indian, or Goanese.  Chinese This category includes people who indicate their race as ""Chinese"" or who identify themselves as Cantonese or Chinese American. In some census tabulations, written entries of Taiwanese are included with Chinese while in others they are shown separately.  Filipino This category includes people who indicate their race as ""Filipino"" or who report entries such as Philipino, Philipine, or Filipino American.  Japanese This category includes people who indicate their race as ""Japanese"" or who report entries such as Nipponese or Japanese American.  Korean This category includes people who indicate their race as ""Korean"" or who provide a response of Korean American.  Vietnamese This category includes people who indicate their race as ""Vietnamese"" or who provide a response of Vietnamese American.  Cambodian This category includes people who provide a response such as Cambodian or Cambodia.  Hmong This category includes people who provide a response such as Hmong, Laohmong, or Mong.  42   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Laotian This category includes people who provide a response such as Laotian, Laos, or Lao.  Thai This category includes people who provide a response such as Thai, Thailand, or Siamese.  Other Asian This category includes people who provide a response of Bangladeshi; Bhutanese; Burmese; Indochinese; Indonesian; Iwo Jiman; Madagascar; Malaysian; Maldivian; Nepalese; Okinawan; Pakistani; Singaporean; Sri Lankan; or Other Asian, specified and Other Asian, not specified.  Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. It includes people who indicate their race as ""Native Hawaiian,"" ""Guamanian or Chamorro,"" ""Samoan,"" and ""Other Pacific Islander.""  Native Hawaiian This category includes people who indicate their race as ""Native Hawaiian"" or who identify themselves as ""Part Hawaiian"" or ""Hawaiian.""  Guamanian or Chamorro This category includes people who indicate their race as such, including written entries of Guam or Chamorro.  Samoan This category includes people who indicate their race as ""Samoan"" or who identify themselves as American Samoan or Western Samoan.  Other Pacific Islander This category includes people who provide a write-in response of a Pacific Islander group such as Carolinian; Chuukese (Trukese); Fijian; Kosraean; Melanesian; Micronesian; Northern Mariana Islander; Palauan; Papua New Guinean; Pohnpeian; Polynesian; Solomon Islander; Tahitian; Tokelauan; Tongan; Yapese; or Other Pacific Islander, specified and Other Pacific Islander, not specified.  Some other race This category includes all other responses not included in American,"" ""American Indian or Alaska Native,"" ""Asian,"" Pacific Islander"" race categories described above. Respondents multiracial, mixed, interracial, or a Hispanic/Latino group (for or Cuban) in the ""Some other race"" write-in space are included the ""White,"" ""Black or African and ""Native Hawaiian or Other providing write-in entries such as example, Mexican, Puerto Rican, in this category.  Two or more races People may have chosen to provide two or more races either by checking two or more race response check boxes, by providing multiple write-in responses, or by some combination of 43   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  check boxes and write-in responses. The race response categories shown on the questionnaire are collapsed into the five minimum races identified by the OMB, and the Census Bureau ""Some other race"" category. For data product purposes, ""Two or more races"" refers to combinations of two or more of the following race categories: White Black or African American American Indian and Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Some other race There are 57 possible combinations (see below) involving the race categories shown above. Thus, according to this approach, a response of ""White"" and ""Asian"" was tallied as two or more races, while a response of ""Japanese"" and ""Chinese"" was not because ""Japanese"" and ""Chinese"" are both Asian responses. Tabulations of responses involving reporting of two or more races within the American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander categories are available in other data products. Two or More Races (57 Possible Specified Combinations) White; Black or African American White; American Indian and Alaska Native White; Asian White; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander White; Some other race Black or African American; American Indian and Alaska Native Black or African American; Asian Black or African American; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Black or African American; Some other race American Indian and Alaska Native; Asian American Indian and Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander American Indian and Alaska Native; Some other race Asian; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Asian; Some other race Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander; Some other race White; Black or African American; American Indian and Alaska Native White; Black or African American; Asian White; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander White; Black or African American; Some other race White; American Indian and Alaska Native; Asian White; American Indian and Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander White; American Indian and Alaska Native; Some other race White; Asian; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander White; Asian; Some other race White; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander; Some other race Black or African American; American Indian and Alaska Native; Asian Black or African American; American Indian and Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander 28.

The most common presentation shows a single line indicating ""Two or more races."" Some data products provide totals of all 57 possible combinations of two or more races, as well as subtotals of people reporting a specific number of races, such as people 45   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  reporting two races, people reporting three races, and so on. In other presentations on race, data are shown for the total number of people who reported one of the six categories alone or in combination with one or more other race categories. For example, the category, ""Asian alone or in combination with one or more other races"" includes people who reported Asian alone and people who reported Asian in combination with White, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and Some other race. This number, therefore, represents the maximum number of people who reported as Asian in the question on race. When this data presentation is used, the individual race categories will add to more than the total population because people may be included in more than one category.  Coding of race write-in responses Census 2000 included an automated review, computer edit, and coding operation on a 100percent basis for the write-in responses to the race question, similar to that used in the 1990 census. There were two types of coding operations: (1) automated coding where a write-in response was automatically coded if it matched a write-in response already contained in a database known as the ""master file,"" and (2) expert coding which took place when a write-in response did not match an entry already on the master file, and was sent to expert clerical coders familiar with the subject matter. During 100-percent processing of Census 2000 questionnaires, subject-matter specialists reviewed and coded written entries from four response categories on the race item: American Indian or Alaska Native, Other Asian, Other Pacific Islander, and Some other race. The Other Asian and Other Pacific Islander response categories shared the same write-in area on the questionnaire. Write-in responses such as Laotian or Thai, and Guamanian or Tongan were reviewed, coded, and tabulated as ""Other Asian"" and ""Other Pacific Islander,"" respectively, in the census. All tribal entries were coded as either American Indian or as Alaska Native. Comparability. The data on race in Census 2000 are not directly comparable to those collected in previous censuses. The October 1997 revised standards issued by the OMB led to changes in the question on race for Census 2000. The Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal data were the first to reflect these changes. First, respondents were allowed to select more than one category for race. Second, the sequence of the questions on race and Hispanic origin changed. In 1990, the question on race (item 4) preceded the question on Hispanic origin (item 7) with two intervening questions. For Census 2000, the question on race immediately follows the question on Hispanic origin. Third, there were terminology changes to the response categories, such as spelling out ""American"" instead of ""Amer."" for the American Indian or Alaska Native category; and adding ""Native"" to the Hawaiian response category. The 1990 category, ""Other race,"" was renamed ""Some other race."" Other differences that may affect comparability involve the individual categories on the Census 2000 questionnaire. The 1990 category, ""Asian and Pacific Islander,"" was separated into two categories, ""Asian"" and ""Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander"" for Census 2000. Accordingly, on the Census 2000 questionnaire, there were seven Asian categories and four Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander categories. The two residual categories, ""Other Asian"" and ""Other Pacific Islander,"" replaced the 1990 single category ""Other API."" The 1990 categories, ""American Indian,"" ""Eskimo,"" and ""Aleut,"" were combined into ""American Indian and Alaska Native."" American Indians and Alaska Natives can report one or more tribes. As in 1980 and 1990, people who reported a Hispanic or Latino ethnicity in the question on race and did not mark a specific race category were classified in the ""Some other race"" category (""Other"" in 1980 and  46   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  ""Other race"" in 1990). They commonly provided a write-in entry such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Latino. In the 1970 census, most of these responses were included in the ""White"" category. In addition, some ethnic entries that in 1990 may have been coded as White or Black are now shown in the ""Some other race"" group.  REFERENCE WEEK The data on employment status and commuting to work are related to a one-week time period, known as the reference week. For each person, this week is the full calendar week, Sunday through Saturday, preceding the date the questionnaire was completed. This calendar week is not the same for all people since the enumeration was not completed in one week. The occurrence of holidays during the enumeration period probably had no effect on the overall measurement of employment status.  SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS Tabulation of data on school enrollment, educational attainment, and employment status for the population 16 to 19 years old allows for calculating the proportion of people 16 to 19 years old who are not enrolled in school and not high school graduates (""dropouts"") and an unemployment rate for the ""dropout"" population. Definitions of the three topics and descriptions of the census items from which they were derived are presented in ""Educational Attainment,"" ""Employment Status,"" and ""School Enrollment and Type of School."" Comparability. The tabulation of school enrollment by employment status is similar to that published in 1980 and 1990 census reports. The 1980 census tabulation included a single data line for Armed Forces; school enrollment, educational attainment, and employment status data were shown for the civilian population only. In 1970, a tabulation was included for 16 to 21 year old males not attending school.  SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND TYPE OF SCHOOL Data on school enrollment were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire items 8a and 8b, which were asked of a sample of the population. People were classified as enrolled in school if they reported attending a ""regular"" public or private school or college at any time between February 1, 2000 and the time of enumeration. The question included instructions to ""include only nursery school or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, and schooling which leads to a high school diploma or a college degree"" as regular school or college. Respondents who did not answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status and type of school of a person with the same age, sex, and race/Hispanic or Latino origin whose residence was in the same or a nearby area.  Public and private school Public and private school includes people who attended school in the reference period and indicated they were enrolled by marking one of the questionnaire categories for either ""public school, public college"" or ""private school, private college."" Schools supported and controlled primarily by a federal, state, or local government are defined as public (including tribal schools). Those supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or other private groups are private. Comparability. School enrollment questions have been included in the census since 1840; highest grade attended was first asked in 1940; type of school was first asked in 1960. Before 1940, the enrollment question in various censuses referred to attendance in the preceding 6 months or the preceding year. In 1940, the reference was to attendance in the month preceding the census, and in the 1950 and subsequent censuses, the question referred to attendance in the two months preceding the census date. 47   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Until the 1910 census, there were no instructions limiting the kinds of schools in which enrollment was to be counted. Starting in 1910, the instructions indicated that attendance at ""school, college, or any educational institution"" was to be counted. In 1930 an instruction to include ""night school"" was added. In the 1940 instructions, night school, extension school, or vocational school were included only if the school was part of the regular school system. Correspondence school work of any kind was excluded. In the 1950 instructions, the term ""regular school"" was introduced, and it was defined as schooling which ""advances a person towards an elementary or high school diploma or a college, university, or professional school degree."" Vocational, trade, or business schools were excluded unless they were graded and considered part of a regular school system. On-the-job training was excluded, as was nursery school. Instruction by correspondence was excluded unless it was given by a regular school and counted towards promotion. In 1960, the question used the term ""regular school or college"" and a similar, though expanded, definition of ""regular"" was included in the instruction, which continued to exclude nursery school. Because of the use of mailed questionnaires in the 1960 census, it was the first census in which instructions were written for the respondent as well as enumerators. In the 1970 census, the questionnaire used the phrase ""regular school or college"" and included instructions to ""count nursery school, kindergarten, and schooling which leads to an elementary school certificate, high school diploma, or college degree."" Instructions in a separate document specified that to be counted as regular school, nursery school must include instruction as an important and integral phase of its program, and continued the exclusion of vocational, trade, and business schools. The 1980 census question was very similar to the 1970 question, but the separate instruction booklet did not require that nursery school include substantial instructional content in order to be counted. Instructions included in the 1990 respondent instruction guide, which was mailed with the census questionnaire, further specified that enrollment in a trade or business school, company training, or tutoring were not to be included unless the course would be accepted for credit at a regular elementary school, high school, or college. The instruction guide defines a public school as ""any school or college controlled and supported by a local, county, state, or federal government."" Schools supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or other private groups were defined as private. In Census 2000 there was no separate instruction guide. The questionnaire reference book used by enumerators and telephone assistance staff contained these definitions for those who asked questions. The age range for which enrollment data have been obtained and published has varied over the censuses. Information on enrollment was recorded for people of all ages in the 1930 and 1940 censuses and 1970 through 2000 censuses; for people under 30 years old, in 1950; and for people 5 to 34 years old in 1960. Most of the published enrollment figures referred to people 5 to 20 years old in the 1930 census, 5 to 24 in 1940, 5 to 29 in 1950, 5 to 34 in 1970, and three years old and over in 1980 and later years. This growth in the age group whose enrollment was reported reflects increased interest in the number of children in preprimary schools and in the number of older people attending colleges and universities. In the 1950 and subsequent censuses, college students were enumerated where they lived while attending college, whereas in earlier censuses, they generally were enumerated at their parental homes. This change should not affect the comparability of national figures on college enrollment since 1940; however, it may affect the comparability over time of enrollment figures at sub-national levels. Type of school was first introduced in the 1960 census, where a separate question asked the enrolled person whether he/she was in a ""public"" or ""private"" school. Beginning with the 1970 census, the type of school was incorporated into the response categories for the enrollment question and the terms were changed to ""public,"" ""parochial,"" and ""other private."" In the 1980 census, ""private, church related"" and ""private, not church related"" replaced ""parochial"" and ""other private."" In 1990 and 2000, ""public"" and ""private"" were used. Data on school enrollment also were collected and published by other federal, state, and local government agencies. Where these data were obtained from administrative records of school 48   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  systems and institutions of higher learning, they were only censuses and household surveys because of differences covered, time references, and enumeration methods. At location of the institution and the residence of the student administrative data. Differences between the boundaries of may also affect these comparisons.  roughly comparable to data from population in definitions and concepts, subject matter the local level, the difference between the may affect the comparability o f census and school districts and census geographic units  SEX The data on sex, which was asked of all people, were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 3 and short-form questionnaire Item 5. Individuals were asked to mark either ""male"" or ""female"" to indicate their sex. For most cases in which sex was not reported, it was determined from the person's given (i.e., first) name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was imputed according to the relationship to the householder and the age of the person. (For more information on imputation, see ""Accuracy of the Data."")  Sex ratio A measure derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth. Comparability. A question on the sex of individuals has been included in every census. Census 2000 was the first time that first name was used for imputation of cases where sex was not reported.  WORK STATUS IN 1999 The data on work status in 1999 were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 30a, which was asked of a sample of the population 15 years old and over. People 16 years old and over who worked one or more weeks according to the criteria described below are classified as ""Worked in 1999."" All other people 16 years old and over are classified as ""Did not work in 1999."" Some earnings tabulations showing work status in 1999 include 15 year olds; these people, by definition, are classified as ""Did not work in 1999.""  Weeks worked in 1999 The data on weeks worked in 1999 were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 30b, which was asked of people 15 years old and over who indicated in long-form questionnaire item 30a that they worked in 1999. The data were tabulated for people 16 years old and over and pertain to the number of weeks during 1999 in which a person did any work for pay or profit (or took paid vacation or paid sick leave) or worked without pay on a family farm or in a family business. Weeks on active duty in the Armed Forces also are included as weeks worked.  Median weeks worked in 1999 Median weeks worked in 1999 divides the weeks worked distribution into two equal parts: onehalf of the cases falling below the median weeks worked and one-half above the median. Median weeks worked in 1999 is computed on the basis of a standard distribution (see the ""Standard Distributions"" section under ""Derived Measures""). Median weeks worked is rounded to the nearest whole number. (For more information on medians, see ""Derived Measures."")  Usual hours worked per week in 1999 The data on usual hours worked in 1999 were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 30c. This question was asked of people 15 years old and over who indicated that they  49   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  worked in 1999 in question 30a, and the data are tabulated for people 16 years old and over. The respondent was asked to report the number of hours usually worked during the weeks worked in 1999. If their hours varied considerably from week to week during 1999, the respondent was asked to report an approximate average of the hours worked each week. People 16 years old and over who reported that they usually worked 35 or more hours each week are classified as ""Usually worked full time""; people who reported that they usually worked 1 to 34 hours each week are classified as ""Usually worked part time.""  Median usual hours worked per week in 1999 Median usual hours worked per week in 1999 divides the usual hours worked distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median usual hours worked and one-half above the median. Median usual hours worked per week in 1999 is computed on the basis of a standard distribution (see the ""Standard Distributions"" section under ""Derived Measures""). Median usual hours worked per week is rounded to the nearest whole hour. (For more information on medians, see ""Derived Measures."")  Aggregate usual hours worked per week in 1999 The aggregate usual hours worked per week in 1999 is the number obtained by summing across the usual hours worked values of all people who worked in 1999. (Note that there is one usual hours value for each worker, so the number of items summed equals the number of workers.)  Mean usual hours worked per week in 1999 Mean usual hours worked per week is calculated by dividing the aggregate number of usual hours worked per week worked in 1999 by the total number of people who worked in 1999. Mean usual hours worked per week is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on means, see ""Derived Measures."")  Full-time, year-round workers Full-time, year-round workers consists of people 16 years old and over who usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 to 52 weeks in 1999. The term ""worker"" in these concepts refers to people classified as ""Worked in 1999"" as defined above. The term ""worked"" in these concepts means ""worked one or more weeks in 1999"" as defined above under ""Weeks Worked in 1999."" Limitation of the data. It is probable that data on the number of people who worked in 1999 and on the number of weeks worked are understated since there was probably a tendency for respondents to forget intermittent or short periods of employment or to exclude weeks worked without pay. There may also have been a tendency for people not to include weeks of paid vacation among their weeks worked, which would result in an underestimate of the number of people who worked ""50 to 52 weeks."" Comparability. The data on weeks worked collected in Census 2000 are comparable with data from the 1960 to 1990 censuses, but may not be entirely comparable with data from the 1940 and 1950 censuses. Starting with the 1960 census, two separate questions have been used to obtain this information. The first identifies people with any work experience during the year and, thus, indicates those people for whom the question about number of weeks worked applies. In 1940 and 1950, the questionnaires contained only a single question on number of weeks worked. In 1970, people responded to the question on weeks worked by indicating one of six weeks-worked intervals. In 1980 and 1990, people were asked to enter the specific number of weeks they worked.  50   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  WORKER The terms ""worker"" and ""work"" appear in connection with several subjects: employment status, journeyto-work, class of worker, and work status in 1999. Their meaning varies and, therefore, should be determined by referring to the definition of the subject in which they appear. When used in the concepts ""Workers in Family,"" ""Workers in Family in 1999,"" and ""Full-Time, Year-Round Workers,"" the term ""worker"" relates to the meaning of work defined for the ""Work Status in 1999"" subject.  YEAR OF ENTRY The data on year of entry were derived from answers to long-form questionnaire item 14 which was asked of a sample of the population. All people born outside the United States were asked for the year in which they came to live in the U.S. This includes people born in Puerto Rico and U.S. Island Areas (such as Guam); people born abroad of American parent(s); and the foreign born. (For more information, see ""Place of Birth"" and ""Citizenship Status."") Limitation of the data. The census questions on nativity, citizenship status, and year of entry were not designed to measure the degree of permanence of residence in the United States. The phrase ""to live"" was used to obtain the year in which the person became a resident of the United States. Although the respondent was directed to indicate the year he or she entered the country ""to live,"" it was difficult to be sure that respondents interpreted the phrase as intended. Comparability. The year of entry questions for the 2000 decennial census and for the American Community Survey (ACS) are identical. This question differs from the year of entry question in the 1990 decennial census. The 1990 decennial census item asked ""When did this person come to the United States to stay?"" Moreover, the year of entry question in the 1990 census provided respondents with a fixed number of response categories, while the year of entry question in both the 2000 decennial census and the ACS collect year of entry through a write-in space.  51   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  HOUSING HARACTERISTICS LIVING QUARTERS Living quarters are either housing units or group quarters. Living quarters are usually found in structures intended for residential use, but also may be found in structures intended for nonresidential use as well as in places such as tents, vans, and emergency and transitional shelters.  Housing unit A housing unit may be a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or, if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. Boats, recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, and the like are housing units only if they are occupied as someone's usual place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for nonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.  Occupied housing unit A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the usual place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of enumeration, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent; that is, away on vacation or a business trip. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. Occupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents; that is, people who consider the hotel as their usual place of residence or have no usual place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are classified as separate housing units. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.  Vacant housing unit A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of enumeration, unless its occupants are only temporarily absent. Units temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration entirely by people who have a usual residence elsewhere are also classified as vacant. New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements; that is, the roof, walls,  52   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished. Comparability. The first Census of Housing in 1940 established the ``dwelling unit'' concept. Although the term became ``housing unit'' and the definition was modified slightly in succeeding censuses, the housing unit definition remained essentially comparable between 1940 and 1990. Since 1990, two changes have been made to the housing unit definition. The first change eliminated the concept of ``eating separately.'' The elimination of the eating criterion makes the housing unit definition more comparable to the United Nations' definition of a housing unit that stresses the entire concept of separateness rather than the specific ``eating'' element. Although the ``eating separately'' criterion was previously included in the definition of a housing unit, the data collected did not actually allow one to distinguish whether the occupants ate separately from any other people in the building. (Questions that asked households about their eating arrangements have not been included in the census since 1970.) Therefore, the current definition better reflects the information that is used in the determination of a housing unit. The second change for Census 2000 eliminated the ``number of nonrelatives'' criterion; that is, ``nine or more people unrelated to the householder'' which converted housing units to group quarters. This change was prompted by the following considerations: (1) there were relatively few such conversions in 1990; (2) household relationship and housing data were lost by converting these housing units to group quarters; and (3) there was no empirical support for establishing a particular number of nonrelatives as a threshold for these conversions. In 1960, 1970, and 1980, vacant rooms in hotels, motels, and other similar places where 75 percent or more of the accommodations were occupied by permanent residents were counted as part of the housing inventory. We intended to classify these vacant units as housing units in the 1990 census. However, an evaluation of the data collection procedures prior to the 1990 census indicated that the concept of permanency was difficult and confusing for enumerators to apply correctly. Consequently, in the 1990 census, vacant rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places were not counted as housing units. In Census 2000, we continued the procedure adopted in 1990.  HOUSEHOLD SIZE This item is based on the count of people in occupied housing units. All people occupying the housing unit are counted, including the householder, occupants related to the householder, and lodgers, roomers, boarders, and so forth. For products based on population data, ``household size'' is the number of people in households. The sample count of ``occupied housing units'' may not match the sample count of ``households.'' Consequently, the household size measures derived from housing and population-based data also may differ. Average household size of occupied unit A measure obtained by dividing the number of people living in occupied housing units by the number of occupied housing units. This measure is rounded to the nearest hundredth. Average household size of owner-occupied unit A measure obtained by dividing the number of people living in owner-occupied housing units by the total number of owner-occupied housing units. This measure is rounded to the nearest hundredth.  53   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Average household size of renter-occupied unit A measure obtained by dividing the number of people living in renter-occupied housing units by the total number of renter-occupied housing units. This measure is rounded to the nearest hundredth.  POPULATION IN OCCUPIED UNITS The data shown for population in occupied units is the total population minus any people living in group quarters. This item is based on the 100-percent count of people in occupied housing units. All people occupying the housing unit are counted, including the householder, occupants related to the householder, and lodgers, roomers, boarders, and so forth.  POVERTY STATUS OF HOUSEHOLDS IN 1999 The data on poverty status of households were derived from answers to the income questions. The income items were asked on a sample basis. Since poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder. Households are classified as poor when the total 1999 income of the householder's family is below the appropriate poverty threshold. (For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold.) The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three criteria: size of family, number of children, and, for 1- and 2-person families, age of the householder.  TELEPHONE SERVICE AVAILABLE The data on telephones were obtained from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 41, which was asked on a sample basis at occupied housing units. Households with telephone service have B62 a telephone in working order and are able to make and receive calls. Households whose service has been discontinued for nonpayment or other reasons are not counted as having telephone service available. Comparability. In Census 2000, the telephone question emphasizes the availability of service in the house, apartment, or mobile home. Data on telephone service are needed because an individual can own a telephone but have no service to make or receive calls. In 1980 and 1990, respondents were asked about the presence of a telephone in the housing unit. In 1960 and 1970, a unit was classified as having a telephone available if there was a telephone number on which the occupants of the unit could be reached. The telephone could have been in another unit, in a common hall, or outside the building.  TENURE The data on tenure, which was asked at all occupied housing units, were obtained from answers to longform questionnaire Item 33 and short-form questionnaire Item 2. All occupied housing units are classified as either owner occupied or renter occupied. Owner occupied A housing unit is owner occupied if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. The owner or co-owner must live in the unit and usually is Person 1 on the questionnaire. The unit is ``Owned by you or someone in this household with a mortgage or loan'' if it is being purchased with a mortgage or some other debt arrangement, such as a deed of trust, trust deed, contract to purchase, land contract, or purchase agreement. The unit  54   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  is also considered owned with a mortgage if it is built on leased land and there is a mortgage on the unit. Mobile homes occupied by owners with installment loans balances are also included in this category. A housing unit is ``Owned by you or someone in this household free and clear (without a mortgage or loan)'' if there is no mortgage or other similar debt on the house, apartment, or mobile home including units built on leased land if the unit is owned outright without a mortgage. The tenure item on the Census 2000 questionnaire distinguishes between units owned with a mortgage or loan and those owned free and clear. In the sample data products, as in the 100percent products, the tenure item provides data for total owner-occupied units. Detailed information that identifies mortgaged and nonmortgaged units are provided in other sample housing matrices. Renter occupied All occupied housing units that are not owner occupied, whether they are rented for cash rent or occupied without payment of cash rent, are classified as renter occupied. ``No cash rent'' units are separately identified in the rent tabulations. Such units are generally provided free by friends or relatives or in exchange for services, such as resident manager, caretaker, minister, or tenant farmer. Housing units on military bases also are classified in the ``No cash rent'' category. ``Rented for cash rent'' includes units in continuing care, sometimes called life care arrangements. These arrangements usually involve a contract between one or more individuals and a service provider guaranteeing the individual shelter, usually a house or apartment, and services, such as meals or transportation to shopping or recreation. Comparability. Data on tenure have been collected since 1890. For 1990, the response categories were expanded to allow the respondent to report whether the unit was owned with a mortgage or loan, or free and clear (without a mortgage). The distinction between units owned with a mortgage and units owned free and clear was added in 1990 to improve the count of owner-occupied units. Research after the 1980 census indicated some respondents did not consider their units owned if they had a mortgage. In Census 2000, we continued with the same tenure categories used in the 1990  UNITS IN STRUCTURE The data on units in structure (also referred to as ``type of structure'') were obtained from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 34, which was asked on a sample basis at both occupied and vacant housing units. A structure is a separate building that either has open spaces on all sides or is separated from other structures by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the number of units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and vacant, are counted. Stores and office space are excluded. The statistics are presented for the number of housing units in structures of specified type and size, not for the number of residential buildings. 1-unit, detached This is a 1-unit structure detached from any other house; that is, with open space on all four sides. Such structures are considered detached even if they have an adjoining shed or garage. A 1-family house that contains a business is considered detached as long as the building has open space on all four sides. Mobile homes to which one or more permanent rooms have been added or built also are included.  55   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  1-unit, attached This is a 1-unit structure that has one or more walls extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. In row houses (sometimes called townhouses), double houses, or houses attached to nonresidential structures, each house is a separate, attached structure if the dividing or common wall goes from ground to roof. 2 or more units These are units in structures containing 2 or more housing units, further categorized as units in structures with 2, 3 or 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, and 50 or more units. Mobile home Both occupied and vacant mobile homes to which no permanent rooms have been added are counted in this category. Mobile homes used only for business purposes or for extra sleeping space and mobile homes for sale on a dealer's lot, at the factory, or in storage are not counted in the housing inventory. In 1990, the category was ``mobile home or trailer.'' Boat, RV, van, etc. This category is for any living quarters occupied as a housing unit that does not fit in the previous categories. Examples that fit in this category are houseboats, railroad cars, campers, and vans. Comparability. Data on units in structure have been collected since 1940 and on mobile homes and trailers since 1950. In 1970 and 1980, these data were shown only for year-round housing units. A category of ``other'' was used in 1990, but this category was greatly overstated. It was replaced by ``Boat, RV, van, etc.'' in Census 2000. A similar category, ``Boat, tent, van, etc.'' was used in 1980. In Census 2000, this question was asked on a sample basis. In 1990 and prior to 1980, the unit in structure question was asked on a 100-percent basis. In 1980, data on units at address were collected on a 100percent basis and data on units in structure were collected on a sample basis. The 1980 data on ``units at address'' should not be used a proxy for ``units in structure'' because some multiunit buildings had more than one street address.  VACANCY STATUS The data on vacancy status were obtained from Enumerator Questionnaire Item C. Vacancy status and other characteristics of vacant units were determined by census enumerators obtaining information from landlords, owners, neighbors, rental agents, and others. Vacant units are subdivided according to their housing market classification as follows: For rent. These are vacant units offered ``for rent,'' and vacant units offered either ``for rent'' or ``for sale.'' For sale only These are vacant units offered ``for sale only,'' including units in cooperatives and condominium projects if the individual units are offered ``for sale only.'' If units are offered either ``for rent'' or ``for sale,'' they are included in the ``for rent'' classification. Rented or sold, not occupied If any money rent has been paid or agreed upon but the new renter has not moved in as of the date of enumeration, or if the unit has recently been sold but the new owner has not yet moved in, the vacant unit is classified as ``rented or sold, not occupied.''  56   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  For seasonal, recreational, or occasional use These are vacant units used or intended for use only in certain seasons, for weekends, or other occasional use throughout the year. Seasonal units include those used for summer or winter sports or recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units also may include quarters for such workers as herders and loggers. Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared-ownership or time-sharing condominiums, also are included in this category. For migrant workers These include vacant units intended for occupancy by migrant workers employed in farm work during the crop season. (Work in a cannery, a freezer plant, or a food-processing plant is not farm work.) Other vacant If a vacant unit does not fall into any of the categories specified above, it is classified as ``other vacant.'' For example, this category includes units held for occupancy by a caretaker or janitor, and units held for personal reasons of the owner. Available housing Available housing units are vacant units that are ``for sale only'' or ``for rent.'' Available housing vacancy rate The available housing vacancy rate is the proportion of the housing inventory that is available ``for sale only'' or ``for rent.'' It is computed by dividing the number of available units by the sum of occupied units and available units, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth. Homeowner vacancy rate The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner housing inventory that is vacant ``for sale.'' It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units ``for sale only'' by the sum of owner-occupied units and vacant units that are ``for sale only,'' and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth. Rental vacancy rate The rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant ``for rent.'' It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units ``for rent'' by the sum of renter-occupied units and vacant units that are ``for rent,'' and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth. Comparability. Data on vacancy status have been collected since 1940. Since 1990, the category, ``For seasonal, recreational, or occasional use,'' has been used. In earlier censuses, separate categories were used to collect data on these types of vacant units. Also, in 1970 and 1980, housing characteristics generally were presented only for year-round units. Beginning in 1990 and continuing into Census 2000, housing characteristics are shown for all housing units.  VEHICLES AVAILABLE The data on vehicles available were obtained from answers to long-form questionnaire Item 43, which was asked on a sample basis at occupied housing units. These data show the number of passenger cars, vans, and pickup or panel trucks of 1-ton capacity or less kept at home and available for the use of  57   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  household members. Vehicles rented or leased for 1 month or more, company vehicles, and police and government vehicles are included if kept at home and used for nonbusiness purposes. Dismantled or immobile vehicles are excluded. Vehicles kept at home but used only for business purposes also are excluded. Aggregate vehicles available To calculate aggregate vehicles available, a value of ``7'' is assigned to vehicles available for occupied units falling within the terminal category, ``6 or more.'' (For more information on aggregates, see ``Derived Measures.'') Vehicles per household (Mean vehicles available) Vehicles per household is computed by dividing aggregate vehicles available by the number of occupied housing units. Vehicles per household is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on means, see ``Derived Measures.'') Limitation of the data. The statistics do not measure the number of vehicles privately owned or the number of households owning vehicles. No separate question was asked on the number of trucks and vans. The data on automobiles and trucks and vans were presented separately and also as a combined vehicles-available tabulation. The 1990 and Census 2000 data are comparable to the 1980 vehiclesavailable tabulations. In 1990, the terminal category identified ``7 or more''; this was changed to ``6 or more'' in Census 2000.  58   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  GEOGRAPHIC TERMS AND CONCEPTS INTRODUCTION  GEOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF DATA In decennial census data products, geographic entities usually are presented in a hierarchical arrangement or as an inventory listing. A hierarchical geographic presentation shows the geographic entities in a superior/subordinate structure. This structure is derived from the legal, administrative, or a real relationship of the entities. The hierarchical structure is depicted in report tables by means of indentation and is explained for computerreadable media in the geographic coverage portion of the abstract in the technical documentation. An example of hierarchical presentation is the ``standard census geographic hierarchy'': census block, within block group, within census tract, within place, within county subdivision, within county, within state, within division, within region, within the United States. Graphically, this is shown as: United States State County County subdivision Place (or part) Census tract (or part) Block group (or part)  BLOCK GROUP (BG) A block group (BG) consists of all census blocks having the same first digit of their four-digit identifying numbers within a census tract. For example, block group 3 (BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. BGs on American Indian reservations, off reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 300 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, worker's dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) Most BGs were delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local, state, or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local or tribal participant.  CENSUS TRACT Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of A11 Census 2000 Geographic Terms and Concepts census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). For Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not represent the same areas. Census tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties and statistically 59   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computerreadable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is included with the related census tract. Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.  COMBINED ZONE A combined zone (CZ) is a statistical entity delineated by state transportation officials for tabulating traffic-related census dataespecially journey-to-work and place-of-work statistics. A CZ consists of one or more analysis zones. Combined zones have not been previously delineated. Unlike in 1990, the CTPP2000 does not strictly separate the urban and statewide parts. Since the local transportation planning officials had priority in submitting TAZs for their counties, we allowed states to develop aggregations of TAZs or tracts for statewide planning in the form of Combined Zones. Each CZ is identified by a six-character alphanumeric code that is unique within county or statistically equivalent entity. For the 1990 census, TAZ codes were unique within CTPP area, which generally conformed to a metropolitan area. This is not necessarily the case in 2000.  COUNTY (OR STATISTICALLY EQUIVALENT ENTITY) The primary legal divisions of most states are termed ``counties.'' In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the statistically equivalent entities are census areas, city and boroughs (as in Juneau City and Borough), a municipality (Anchorage), and organized boroughs. Census areas are delineated cooperatively for data presentation purposes by the state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states; these incorporated places are known as ``independent cities'' and are treated as equivalent to counties for data presentation purposes. (In some data presentations, they may be treated as county subdivisions and places.) The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the entire area is  60   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  considered equivalent to a county for data presentation purposes. Each county and statistically equivalent entity is assigned a three-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code that is unique within state. These codes are assigned in alphabetical order of county or county equivalent within state, except for the independent cities, which are assigned codes higher than and following the listing of counties.  COUNTY SUBDIVISION County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and statistically equivalent entities for data presentation purposes. They include census county divisions, census subareas, minor civil divisions (MCDs), unorganized territories, and incorporated places that are independent of any MCD. Each county subdivision is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within each state.  METROPOLITAN AREA (MA) The general concept of a metropolitan area (MA) is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei. The MAs and the central cities within an MA are designated and defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget, following a set of official standards that are published in a Federal Register Notice. These standards were developed by the interagency Federal Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MAs nationwide. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a U.S. Census Bureaudefined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). An MA contains one or more central counties. An MA also may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county. An outlying county must have a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as population density, urban population, and population growth. In New England, MAs consist of groupings of cities and county subdivisions (mostly towns) rather than whole counties. The territory, population, and housing units in MAs are referred to as ``metropolitan.'' The metropolitan category is subdivided into ``inside central city'' and ``outside central city.'' The territory, population, and housing units located outside territory designated ``metropolitan'' are referred to as ``nonmetropolitan.'' The metropolitan and nonmetropolitan classification cuts across the other hierarchies; for example, generally there are both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. To meet the needs of various users, the standards provide for a flexible structure of metropolitan definitions that classify each MA either as a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or as a consolidated metropolitan statistical area divided into primary metropolitan statistical areas. In New England, there also is an alternative county-based definition of MSAs known as the New England County Metropolitan Areas. (See definitions below.) Documentation of the MA standards and how they are applied is available from the Census Bureau WEB page, www.census.gov.  61   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (MSA) Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) are metropolitan areas (MAs) that are not closely associated with other MAs. These areas typically are surrounded by nonmetropolitan counties (county subdivisions in New England).  METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION REGION (MPO REGION) MPO Regions are counties (or MCDs are not necessarily MPO expects to be defined by each MPO as their planning region. The region is an aggregation of in New England). The regions should mostly correlate to the Metropolitan Areas, but exact to the official definitions. Instead the MPO Region reflects the area that the planning for over the course of the decade.  PLACE Places, for the reporting of decennial census data, include census designated places, consolidated cities, and incorporated places. Each place is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, based on the alphabetical order of the place name within each state. If place names are duplicated within a state and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal description (for example, ``city'' before ``village'').  PUBLIC USE MICRODATA AREA (PUMA) A public use microdata area (PUMA) is a decennial census area for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides specially selected extracts of raw data from a small sample of long-form census records that are screened to protect confidentiality. These extracts are referred to as ``public use microdata sample (PUMS)'' files. Since 1960, data users have been using these files to create their own statistical tabulations and data summaries. For Census 2000, state, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico participants, following U.S. Census Bureau criteria, delineated two types of PUMAs within their states. PUMAs of one type comprise areas that contain at least 100,000 people. The PUMS files for these PUMAs contain a 5-percent sample of the long-form records. The other type of PUMAs, super-PUMAs, comprise areas of at least 400,000 people. The sample size is 1 percent for the PUMS files for super-PUMAs. PUMAs cannot be in more than one state or statistically equivalent entity. The larger 1-percent PUMAs are aggregations of the smaller 5percent PUMAs.  STATE (OR STATISTICALLY EQUIVALENT ENTITY) States are the primary governmental divisions of the United States. The District of Columbia is treated as a statistical equivalent of a state for data presentation purposes. For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau also treats a number of entities that are not legal divisions of the United States as statistically equivalent to a state: American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Each state and statistically equivalent entity is assigned a two-digit numeric Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order by state name. The census code is assigned on the basis of the geographic sequence of each state within each census division; the first digit of the code identifies the respective division.  TRAFFIC ANALYSIS ZONE (TAZ) A traffic analysis zone (TAZ) is a statistical entity delineated by state and/or local transportation officials for tabulating traffic-related census dataespecially journey-to-work and place-of-work statistics. A TAZ 62   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  usually consists of one or more census blocks, block groups, or census tracts. For the 1990 census, TAZs were defined as part of the Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP). The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for TAZs in conjunction with the 1980 census, when it identified them as ``traffic zones.'' Each TAZ is identified by a six-character alphanumeric code that is unique within county or statistically equivalent entity. For the 1990 census, TAZ codes were unique within CTPP area, which generally conformed to a metropolitan area. This is not necessarily the case in 2000.  URBAN AND RURAL (URBANIZED AREA) The U.S. Census Bureau classifies as urban all territory, population, and housing units located within urbanized areas (UAs) and urban clusters (UCs). It delineates UA and UC boundaries to encompass densely settled territory, which generally consists of:  A cluster of one or more block groups or census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile at the time.  Surrounding block groups and census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 500 people per square mile at the time.  Less densely settled blocks that form enclaves or indentations, or are used to connect discontiguous areas with qualifying densities. Rural consists of all territory, population, and housing units located outside of UAs and UCs. Geographic entities, such as metropolitan areas, counties, minor civil divisions, and places, often contain both urban and rural territory, population, and housing units. This urban and rural classification applies to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.  USER UPDATES User updates supply data users with additional or corrected information that becomes available after the technical documentation or files are prepared. They are issued as Count Question Resolution Notes, Data Notes, Geography Notes, and Technical Documentation Notes in a numbered series and are available in portable document format (PDF) on the Census Bureau Web site at http://www.census.gov.  63   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  Standard Hierarchy of Census Geographic Entities  64   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000  DERIVED MEASURES Census data products include various derived measures, such as medians, means, and percentages, as well as certain rates and ratios. Derived measures that round to less than 0.1 are shown as zero.  AGGREGATE An aggregate is the sum of the values for each of the elements in the universe. For example, aggregate household income is the sum of the incomes of all households in a given geographic area. Means are derived by dividing the aggregate by the appropriate universe.  AVERAGE See ``Mean.''  INTERPOLATION Interpolation is frequently used to calculate medians or quartiles and to approximate standard errors from tables based on interval data. Different kinds of interpolation may be used to estimate the value of a function between two known values, depending on the form of the distribution. The most common distributional assumption is that the data are linear, resulting in linear interpolation. However, this assumption may not be valid for income data, particularly when the data are based on wide intervals. For these cases, a Pareto distribution is assumed and the median is estimated by interpolating between the logarithms of the upper and lower income limits of the median category. The Census Bureau estimates median income using the Pareto distribution within intervals when the intervals are wider than $2,500.  MEAN This measure represents an arithmetic average of a set of values. It is derived by dividing the sum (or aggregate) of a group of numerical items by the total number of items in that group. For example, mean household earnings is obtained by dividing the aggregate of all earnings reported by individuals with earnings living in households by the total number of households with earnings.  ROUNDING FOR SELECTED AGGREGATES To protect the confidentiality of responses, the aggregates shown in matrices for the list of subjects below are rounded. This means that the aggregates for these subjects, except for travel time to work, are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Unless special rounding rules apply (see below); $150 rounds up to $200; $149 rounds down to $100. Note that each cell in a matrix is rounded individually. This means that an aggregate value shown for the United States may not necessarily be the sum total of the aggregate values in the matrices for the states. This also means that the cells in the aggregate matrices may not add to the total and/or subtotal lines.  SPECIAL ROUNDING RULES FOR AGGREGATES  If the dollar value is between $100 and +$100, then the dollar value is rounded to $0.  If the dollar value is less than $100, then the dollar value is rounded to the nearest $100. Aggregates Subject to Rounding Earnings in 1999 (Households) Earnings in 1999 (Individuals) Income in 1999 (Household/Family/Nonfamily Household) Income in 1999 (Individuals) Travel Time To Work*  65   Census Transportation Planning Package 2000    Aggregate travel time to work is zero if the aggregate is zero, is rounded to 4 minutes if the aggregate is 1 to 7 minutes, and is rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 minutes for all other values (if the aggregate is not already evenly divisible by 5).  MEDIAN This measure represents the middle value (if n is odd) or the average of the two middle values (if n is even) in an ordered list of n data values. The median divides the total frequency distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median and one-half above the median. Each median is calculated using a standard distribution (see below). (For more information, see ``Interpolation.'') For data products displayed in American FactFinder, medians that fall in the upper-most category of an open-ended distribution will be shown with a plus symbol (+) appended (e.g., ``$2,000+'' for contract rent), and medians that fall in the lowest category of an open-ended distribution will be shown with a minus symbol (-) appended (e.g., ``$100- for contract rent''). For data products on CD-ROM and DVD, and data files that are downloaded by users (i.e., FTP files), plus and minus signs will not be appended. Contract rent, for example will be shown as $2001 if the median falls in the upper-most category ($2,000 or more) and $99 if the median falls in the lowest category (Less than $100). (The ``Standard Distributions'' section below shows the open-ended intervals for medians.)  STANDARD DISTRIBUTIONS In order to provide consistency in the values within and among data products, standard distributions from which medians and quartiles are calculated are used for Census 2000. This is a new approach for Census 2000; in previous censuses medians were not necessarily based on a single, standard distribution. The Census 2000 standard distributions are listed below.

QUARTILE This measure divides a distribution into four equal parts. The first quartile (or lower quartile) is the value that defines the upper limit of the lowest one-quarter of the cases. The second quartile is the median. The third quartile (or upper quartile) is defined as the upper limit of the lowest three quarters of cases in the distribution. Quartiles are presented for certain financial characteristics, such as housing value and contract rent. The distribution used to compute quartiles is the same as that used to compute medians for that variable.  RATE This is during vacant only,'' a measure of occurrences in a given period of time divided by the possible number of occurrences that period. For example, the homeowner vacancy rate is calculated by dividing the number of units ``for sale only'' by the sum of owner-occupied units and vacant units that are ``for sale and then multiplying by 100. Rates are sometimes presented as percentages.  RATIO This is a measure of the relative size of one number to a second number expressed as the quotient of the first number divided by the second. For example, the sex ratio is calculated by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females, and then multiplying by 100.  69"
