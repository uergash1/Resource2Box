What is a Septic System   A ""septic system,"" also referred to as a private, on-site waste disposal system, receives waste water and solids from a building's plumbing facilities (bathrooms, kitchens, shower, laundry), treats, and then disposes of the effluent from this waste, by permitting it to absorb into soils at the property. ""Treatment"" is accomplished by bacterial action in the ""septic"" or ""treatment"" tank and it is mostly accomplished by bacteria in the soil around and below the effluent absorption system, or ""drain field."" This bacterial action is needed to reduce the level of pathogens in the effluent discharges from the waste system into the soil. The principal components of a private on-site waste disposal system usually include the following:       piping connecting the building to the treatment tank   a septic or treatment tank which retains solid waste   piping connecting and conducting clarified effluent from the treatment tank to a distribution box   a distribution box connecting the effluent line from the tank to the absorption system or ""drain field""   an absorption system which permits effluent to drain to soils below   a bio-mat or bio-mass of pathogen-digesting bacteria which forms in soil below the absorption system.     Many variations on this general scheme are used, depending on local climate, soil conditions, available space, economy, and available materials. Special equipment and systems may be designed for problem or difficult sites such as rocky or wet ground, permafrost, or wet tropical marshlands.

SAFETY WARNINGS - Septic Tank Safety Warnings for Septic Inspectors, Septic Pumpers, and Homeowners   This chapter is maintained at  Septic System, Septic Tank, &  Cesspool Safety Warnings for Septic Inspectors, Septic Pumpers, and Homeowners  but text is repeated here for readers who scroll down rather than linking to the separate chapter.   Providing inspection and diagnosis of on-site waste disposal systems is an extremely valuable public service which helps protect people from expensive unanticipated septic system repair costs and helps protect public health by assuring sanitary disposal of sewage and gray water waste from buildings. More importantly though, such inspections may detect and warn about serious safety hazards at some properties. The strong warnings issued below intend to reduce septic system safety hazards for inspectors and property owners/occupants, but it is not the author's intention to dissuade inspectors from providing this valuable service. But danger lurks at cesspools, open covers, tanks or tank covers in poor condition, and from high levels of methane gas. These risk collapse, falling, asphyxiation, and other potentially  fatal hazards  as well as risks of unsanitary conditions.     Don't work alone:  Falling into a septic tank or even leaning over a septic tank can be fatal. Do not work on or at septic tanks alone - workers can become suddenly overcome by methane gas.   Do not ever go into a septic tank  unless you are specially trained and are wearing the special equipment and gear for that purpose, including self-contained breathing apparatus.   Don't enter the septic tank : Never go into a septic tank to retrieve someone who has fallen in and was overcome by toxic gases without a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). if a SCBA is not available, call for emergency services and put a fan at the top of the tank to blow in fresh air.   Don't lean over the septic tank openings  Do not lean over or stick your head into the septic tank to examine its interior - you could fall in to the tank or become overcome by gases and fall into the tank, an event which is likely to be fatal.   Don't ignite flames  Do not light a flame at or near the tank - methane gas is explosive. At one tank pumpout my client described the explosion and burns received by the pumping contractor when he stood by the tank and lit a cigarette.   Site must be ventilated : Decomposing wastes in the septic tank produce toxic gases (such as methane) which can kill a human in a matter of minutes. When working on a tank be sure the area is well ventilated.   Rope off & Mark Dangerous Sites : If your inspection discover that there are dangerous conditions, such as an unsafe tank cover, tank collapse, or a home-made septic tank or cesspool (which are at increased risk of sudden collapse) such areas should be roped off and clearly marked as dangerous to prevent access until proper evaluation and repairs can be made.   Safe covers : be sure that the tank and its access ports have sound and secure covers that do not risk collapse and which cannot be removed by children.   Septic & Cesspool Collapse Hazards : Old steel tanks, thin, rusting steel or rotting home-made wood tank covers, site-built tanks and cesspools, and recently-pumped cesspools are at particular risk of collapse. Falling into a septic tank or cesspool is likely to lead to rapid asphyxiation from methane and in cases of collapse, there is risk of becoming buried. The author has consulted in cases involving such fatalities (homeowner fell into a site-built cesspool), and at one site inspection, walking near an overgrown area the author himself stepped through a rusting steel septic tank top, surviving only by throwing himself into a nearby clump of brambles!  Beware of       flimsy, rusted, old-steel, home-made, or missing septic tank/drywell/cesspool covers    abandoned systems which may not have been filled-in    collapsed, or collapsing septic tanks or cesspools    possible presence of multiple components at a property, abandoned or in-use        Unsanitary conditions : Be alert for unsanitary conditions such as surface effluent or sewage backups into buildings, events which risk serious viral and bacterial hazards and which indoors, may require professional cleaning. Be alert for personal sanitation hazards when working around septic systems, such as open cuts or failure to wash properly after working on systems.   Damage to Septic Components : Avoid damaging septic system components or the building: Improper septic testing procedures, such as flooding a dosing-system, can damage the system. Also, remember to check for leaks into or under the building being tested when running water into the building fixtures and drains. Don't leave water running unattended - at risk of flooding the building.      Septic Systems Online Book    Septic System Safety Warnings for Home Owners and Home Buyers    Septic system concerns for a building owner start with safety. Here are some red flags:     Signs of collapse-possible fatal hazards:  include depressions or ""soil subsidence"" anywhere on or around the property. Any suspect area should be roped-off and absolutely no one should walk over or even close to such a spot until it has been investigated by a professional.   Old or abandoned systems:  such as site-built cesspools or drywells were often made with a thin steel or wood cover which with age can collapse. If the history of the site or visual observation suggests that there are or were old systems at the property, professional investigation is warranted. Improper ""abandonment"" (failing to fill-in a pit) can lead to sudden collapses. Signs that there may be old systems at a property might come from anecdotal evidence (ask a neighbor, ask the local septic installing or service companies), or visual evidence such as seeing abandoned waste pipes at basement or crawl space walls or floors. Don't assume that an old house which is now connected to the public sewer didn't previously have an on-site waste disposal system.   Septic service by untrained workers:  such as aerating, agitating, or pumping out an old site-built cesspool, can lead to sudden system collapse. Prevent access over or near any such systems.   Unsanitary conditions  such as discharge of sewage effluent to the yard surface, to a nearby well or stream, or previous septic backups into a building deserve professional attention. Indoors special cleaning may be needed to remove bacteria or other pathogens.    Septic testing by inexpert ""inspectors""  who may not follow an adequate procedure increases the risk of a costly surprise.   Uninformed homeowners may not notice a danger or malfunction .Homeowners  should review the  safety warnings listed above . The information here is general in nature. Since conditions and requirements vary widely at individual sites, the you should obtain qualified expert advice pertaining to the specific system about which you have questions, and should not rely on this general text for costly diagnostic/repair/replacement decisions. In other words, I'll try to give you some helpful information. In exchange, don't expect me to pay for your new septic system.     Septic Systems Online Book   Septic Inspector Qualifications/Licensing    If you perform septic inspections you are obligated to do so with proper information, training, procedures, and in some communities a license is required. Some states (e.g. CA, CT, NJ, MA) have specific certification requirements for inspectors of septic systems, as well as specific regulations regarding the performance of the inspection itself. Be sure to obtain information pertinent to your own state, usually from the state health department or state department of environmental protection. For example, Massachusetts septic inspectors will want to look at the links and the Title 5 regulations at our page on   the Massachusetts Septic Testing Law . Other links to septic system installation and inspection regulatory agencies are at our  ""Local, State, U.S. Federal Government, & International Agencies   & Resources for Septic Systems Wastewater Treatment"" page.    Septic System Inspection Authorities    INSPECTION AUTHORITY: some municipalities and states (EG. Pennsylvania) provide septic inspection and testing certification. However a generalist inspector such as an ASHI professional, in the course of a home inspection, is permitted to observe and report visual evidence of defects, probable, or possible defects, just as any contractor might observe and report when coming to a property for any reason. For municipalities requiring certification of septic test providers, home inspectors should consult with local officials for further advice.Note: some authorities, such as New Jersey Administrative Code 7:9-3.17 (b)5 require septic system evaluations to be performed only by a licensed professional engineer, licensed health officer, licensed sanitary engineer, or trained technician under supervision of the septic system inspector as defined in the pertinent code. However our review of these codes finds them probably unenforceable since in some instances the codes contradict themselves (see quote below) or the code agencies provide homeowner pamphlets calling for annual inspections which are made by the homeowner him or her self. ""All testing of operating systems which requires a hydraulic loading which is in excess of the design flow shall be performed under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer."" (New Jersey EPA, Sub 12, 7:9A-12.7 System Testing."") Some codes also require that the details of the septic evaluation procedure itself be included in the report. [Information courtesy of Ed Fitzgerald, ASHI.]  The next chapters discuss ways in which septic system components fail, and with the inspection of the individual septic system components.

This chapter discusses detailed ""how to"" steps instructing the investigator in how to inspect specific septic components for signs of failure. The following section will discuss types and causes of septic failure and will provide criteria that define ""failure.""   Before digging up your septic tank or calling a septic pumper, if you think the septic system is failed because of drain blockage or drains backing up into the building, you should to see   ""Diagnosing Clogged Drains:  Is it a blocked drain or the septic system? - A First Step for Homeowners"". If you link to that text, please return here using your browser's ""BACK"" button.    Onsite Waste Disposal System Failure Criteria   Massachusetts Title 5 lists specific failure criteria and serves as a good model for septic inspections anywhere.     Backup anywhere in the system    Discharge of effluent to the surface, stream, etc. regardless of whether or not septic dye is observed    Static effluent level or floating scum over the top of the baffles in the septic tank [added by DF]    Static effluent level above outlet in the D-box    System has to be pumped more than 4x/year    Metal septic tanks (municipality dependent; note that in special site conditions small metal tanks may be the ""only"" solution and may be approved by local officials. An owner/buyer must be informed of the implications of such installations.)    Soil Absorption System (or cesspool, etc) is at a depth exposing it to the maximum groundwater level     Septic Systems Online Book   Inspecting Outside Waste Piping   Outside waste piping conducts sewage (black water and gray water) from the building to the treatment tank or ""septic tank,"" and from the treatment tank to the distribution box. These lines should be of solid, non-perforated material and need to be protected from mechanical damage (such as by vehicles). Piping extending from the distribution box into drain fields is normally perforated, though solid lines might be used if effluent is being processed by more specialized devices such as seepage pits, galleys, or a sand-bed system.    House to tank   This line may become blocked by waste, damaged by collapse of a section, or invaded by roots. Detection of these conditions is fairly easy by routing a snake or power snake from the building drain to the septic tank. An experienced power snake operator can often tell by ""feel"" that a drain line is collapsed, partially collapsed, or invaded by roots. While you may make a temporary ""repair"" of such a condition by drain-cleaning, if the line is broken or root-invaded, you should expect to have to excavate and replace it soon.    Tank to Distribution Box   The same failures can occur on this line as from house to tank. Opening the D-box can also show whether or not effluent is being directed uniformly into each of the leach lines. A tipped D-box can overload one line and cause early failure of the absorption system. If this is happening, flow adjustment end-caps (eccentric  holes) can be installed in the distribution box on the inlet end of each of the drain lines, permitting adjustment of effluent delivery into each line, perhaps relieving the problem line and redistributing effluent into the others.    Drain field piping   In a conventional ""drain field"" of perforated pipes buried in gravel-filled trenches, a drain line may be invaded by tree roots. This is why experts advise keeping tree and shrub plantings away from drain fields. Vehicle traffic can also collapse this or any outdoor waste piping, which is why experts advise against ever driving over a drainfield or over any other septic system components.

The purpose of the treatment tank or ""septic tank"" is to contain solid waste and to permit the beginning of bacterial action to process sewage into a combination of clarified effluent, settled sludge, or floating scum in the tank. An intact, un-damaged septic tank is normally always filled with these materials. However the inspector performing a ""visual"" check of the septic system needs to be alert for some important findings:      Subsidence at the tank location - may risk dangerous, potentially fatal collapse   Evidence of recent work   Evidence of backup or effluent breakout at the surface in the tank area       Only by pumping and visual inspection can actual tank capacity and condition be completely determined. Probing in the area of a tank, without excavation, is not recommended as the probe may damage a steel or fiberglass tank. When a tank is uncovered for pumping additional critical details may be observed before the pumping operation      Condition and safety of the tank and access covers   Liquid and waste level in the tank - evidence of waste passing over the baffles - a flooded system, an indicator of system failure   damage to the tank baffles      When the tank is opened and to be cleaned or pumped out additional information is available:      Thickness of scum and sludge levels: Septic tank maximum scum and sludge buildup prior to pump out, and instructions for measuring the floating scum layer thickness and settled sludge layer thickness in a septic tank are available in a separate chapter at  Septic Tank Pumping Guide   Back-flow of effluent into the tank during pumpdown - an indicator of flooded leach fields   Additional evidence of damage to the tank baffles   Evidence of damage to the tank itself - cracks, leaks     Septic Systems Online Book   Steel septic tanks    Steel tanks typically last 20-25 years, then rust, and collapse. Before this time steel baffles may rust off (damaging the drain field with sludge) or the tank top may become rusty and unsafe. Since steel tank tops can be replaced while leaving the old tank in place, the condition of the top itself is not a reliable indicator of tank condition.     Rusting steel tank covers can cause death!  Rusted covers can collapse. I have reports of children and adults who have died from this hazard, as recently as December 1997. In 2000 I consulted in a fatality involving an adult falling into a cesspool. At a building inspection I myself stepped through a hidden, rusted-through steel septic tank cover. Falling into a septic tank, drywell, or cesspool is quickly fatal, either from being buried by falling soils and debris, or by asphyxiation. Septic gases are highly toxic and can kill in just minutes of exposure. Even leaning over an empty (just pumped) tank has led to collapse and fatality of a septic pumper.     Steel tank baffles:  rust out and fall off, permitting solids to enter the soil absorption system    Steel tank bottoms rust out  permitting effluent to leak into soils around the tank, possibly giving a large void in tank at time of testing, thus subverting a loading or dye test.    Concrete septic tanks   Concrete tanks at an existing septic installation are usually viable, but might have damaged baffles or cracks that permit seepage of groundwater in or septic effluent out around the tank. Occasionally we've seen tanks made of poor-quality concrete (insufficient portland cement) which eroded badly. If the tank outlet or absorption system have been blocked, examination of the tank interior may show that effluent is or has been above the top of the baffles (see ""baffles"" below) thus indicating a system failure discussed next.    Concrete tanks can crack  or sections may separate causing leaks with the result of not only improper disposal of effluent (wrong location) but also subverting an attempt at a septic loading and dye test since when the system is un-used the tank liquid levels drop abnormally. The inspector may detect this condition only if there is a tank inspection port which is readily and safely accessible for before, during, and after inspection when running a loading and dye test.   Septic Systems Online Book   Home made or ""site built tanks- [TBD]    Site built systems, in my experience, are often under-sized and worse, dangerous. There is a serious risk of collapse of old rotting wood covers, collapsing concrete block dry-laid tank or ""cesspool"" walls, etc. Other types of tanks and home-made onsite systems are described below at   Septic Tank Type, Capacity, Material Details    Baffles: Inspecting the Condition of Septic Tank Baffles   Baffles in a septic tank are provided to keep solids and floating scum and grease inside the tank. Baffles are provided at both the inlet to the tank (from the building) and the outlet from the tank (to the absorption system).     Broken baffles or high sludge levels can cause solids to flow out of the tank and into the absorption system. The result is reduced absorption into surrounding soil and eventual failure of the system. Floating scum thickness and settled solids thickness can be measured through access ports into the tank or cesspool. Finding solids at or covering the outlets or damaged baffles should result in report of a very questionable adsorption system and possible major repair cost.    Concrete tank baffles:  may erode from chemicals, detergents, poor concrete mix, water flowing over top of baffles, or may be broken by improper pumping procedure  "

They keep pathway weeds from        your garden soil, prevent soil compaction, provide good drainage and serve as        a barrier to pests such as slugs and snails.                By raising the soil level, raised beds also reduce back strain when bending        over to tend the bed. Raised beds are  available in a variety of different materials, or they can be made with relative ease.                                                               buy        a ready-made raised bed, or raised bed components                 Note:  To see our full collection of raised beds,  click here .

Lumber:   Use            cedar 2 x 6 for the sides, and 4 x 4 for the corner posts. If you have            wood wider than 2 x 6"", it's fine to use but the overall height of            the bed should be 12"" or less. If cedar is not available, ask your            lumber dealer for locally available weather resistant wood.                            Fastenings:  Use 3.5galvanized 'spiral' nails. You'll need        32 - 40 nails for this project. (3"" galvanized screws can used in        place of nails - they will hold better but are a little more expensive.)                            Size:          The          bed can be made any size you like, but consider:          Width:  4'  should be a maximum width, so it's easy        to reach the middle of the bed.         Length:   The            bed shown   here is 3' x 6'. Raised beds longer              than 6' will require additional stakes in the middle of the two long sides              to keep them from bowing under the weight of the soil.                                  Is treated lumber safe?   Treated          lumber is often used for outdoor projects. Chemicals used to preserve          lumber include organic compounds such as pentachlorophenol, creosote and          coal tars. Other preservatives contain chromated copper arsenate (CCA),          ammonical copper arsenate and acid copper chromate.   There            is growing concern about the dangers of arsenic leaching into the ground            or rubbing off on people's hands from CCA-treated wood.                     U ntil the safety              of treated wood is proven conclusively, we recommend you use a naturally              rot-resistant wood like red cedar, black locust or redwood.                Under most circumstances, these woods will last                  10 - 20 years when used for raised beds. Recycled composite plastic lumber (see below) is another              alternative, and is now available in a variety of sizes and colors.                                                                 construction:                           1.  Cut the 4x 4 to four 18lengths. Sharpen the ends with a handsaw or hatchet.        (This does not have to be pretty - only the worms will see.)                            2.  Assemble        the two short sides first, on a firm, flat surface. Lay two of the sharpened        corner pieces down, set two of the   2 x 6's        on top and line up the edges. Pre-drill the nail holes to avoid splitting        the wood. Be sure the drill bit you use is just a bit thinner than the nails.                                          3.  Stand one of the assembled sides up on its top edge, so the sharpened ends        of the corner posts are pointing up. Set one long piece in place and nail        the one end to the corner post. Now your construction will stand on its        own (upside down) and be easier to finish.                                        4.         Nail the remaining long pieces to the one short side. Set the other short        side in place and finish the job. (If your bed is longer than 6"", you'll                        Flip it over and you're ready to install.                                                                                    raised        bed installation / tips:                                 Double-dig        the bed area.  Turn over the soil to a depth of 16 Leave soil piled up in the center,          away from the sides.            Set            bed in place and tap down corners.  If              the bed has built-in stakes, as in the 'build-your-own' model described              above, drive one corner down a few inches, then go on to the others and              do the same. Repeat this process until bed is at ground level. If you              try to drive one corner all the way down before going on to the others,              you put too much twist on the structure and may split out one of the stakes.         Level          the bed.  Use a level for this task. This            may seem overly meticulous, but after several waterings the soil will            settle to level, and youl want the bed to be the same. Set a stiff board            (2x4) on top of the bed sides, across the span, and set your level on            this board. Tap down the sides as needed till you get a level reading. Be            sure to check for level both along the length and across the width of            your bed.          Burrowing          pests?           If your garden has burrowing pests such as moles, a layer of 1"" poultry            netting (chicken wire) can be laid across the bottom, before soil is added.            The mesh should continue at least 3"" up along the insides  of the bed and be stapled            in place. If you plan to grow root crops, such as potatoes or carrots, you may want to set the chicken wire lower in the ground by digging deeper when you are setting up the bed.               Spread          soil out evenly.              Add any planned soil amendments, such as peat, compost or lime, and spread          the soil evenly across the bed.  Water the bed with an even, fine spray. This will settle the soil;                add more soil to ""top off"". (Over time the soil will settle                an inch or two more.) Rake the bed once more to even out the soil and youe ready to plant.                                   Avoid stepping on the bed.   Once the soil                      is added and the bed is planted, make it a policy to never step on the                      bed. Stepping on the bed will compact the soil, reduce aeration and impact                      root growth. Pets should also be trained to stay off the raised beds.                                 Pathway width.  It helps when                        pathways between raised beds are wide enough for a small wheelbarrow. For grass pathways, make sure they                        are at least wide enough for a weedeater or a small mower. (In our raised bad garden the pathways are 21"" wide.)                                         Mulch the pathways between beds.  Weeding pathways is a nuisance which you can avoid by putting a double layer of perforated landscape cloth over the pathway, and  cover this with a 2- 3"" layer of bark mulch . When laying down the landscape cloth, allow it to come up 1"" against the bottom board of the bed, and staple this to the bed. This will not be visible because the mulch will cover it.                                Some weeds will still appear on your pathways regardless of the mulch. Wait until it rains before pulling them out, or you may rip the landscape cloth. The weeds will come out easily if the ground is wet.                                                                                               Raised        bed supplies:  (to see all our raised beds and supplies,  click here )                                         Composters - choose from 8 different styles         The best ingredient            to put in raised beds is your own compost.

SPACING THE FENCE POSTS                   As a rule, you should set fence posts about 6' to 8' apart. The spacing of the posts depends on the type of fence you build, the terrain, the purpose of the fence and other such factors.                     Set the corner or end post first. Then stretch a line from each corner or end post to align all the posts in between.                     Drive a stake every 6' to 8' at the exact position where the post hole is to be dug (Fig. 1).                     Take time to measure and position the posts accurately. The appearance and the structural strength of your fence depends a great deal on the positioning of the fence posts.                                   STEP 2               FIG. 2                    FIG. 3  - Use a level to make sure each post is in an exact, upright position.                    FIG. 4  - Build a mound around each post to eliminate standing water.                    FIG. 5  - Brace all corner posts in both directions to help them carry weight.                    FIG. 6  - The heads of posts should be rounded, capped or slanted to shed water.             SETTING THE FENCE POSTS                   Set all wood fence posts with about 1/3 of their total length buried in the ground. This is especially important on corner posts and any posts that will carry heavy weight or withstand high wind pressure.                     Use a regular post hole digger to dig the post holes. Dig the holes straight to the proper depth at each stake marker.                     You can anchor the posts more firmly by making the holes slightly larger at the bottom than at the top (Fig. 2). Place a large stone or two shovels full of gravel in the bottom of each hole. This provides drainage to avoid excessive moisture at the base of each post.                     Use a wood preservative to treat the section of the post that will be underground. Allow the post to stand overnight in the preservative so it can become well-saturated.                     You can pack the posts with either dirt or concrete. In either case, place two or three shovels full of gravel in the bottom of each hole before the post is placed into position.                     Be sure the posts are in an exact, upright position (Fig. 3). You can check the alignment of each post with a regular level. You can also check the alignment of the posts in one direction by sighting from one end of the row of posts to the other.                     Brace each post with stakes after it is properly aligned (Fig. 3). Keep the stakes in position until the concrete (if used) has thoroughly set. Remove the nails holding the braces and readjust the post until it is in accurate alignment.                     When the post is properly aligned, tamp it thoroughly to pack the dirt (if used) around the base of the post. Be sure you do not alter the alignment of the post during the tamping process.                     When the post is firmly in position, build a mound around it to help eliminate water standing at the post base (Fig. 4). Slope the concrete slightly away from the post and round it off with a trowel. Tamp the concrete lightly to eliminate any air bubbles left in the mixture that can act as water pockets.                     Provide extra bracing at all corners (Fig. 5). A corner post must carry the weight of fence stretched in two directions, so it should be set in both directions.                     Allow the posts to stand several days and settle firmly in position before adding the fence.                     The heads of posts should be rounded, capped or slanted to help eliminate accumulating water, which can cause rotting (Fig. 6). This is well-worth the effort since it allows the posts to last.                                   STEP 3               FIG. 7  - There are three ways to attach top rails.                    FIG. 8                    FIG. 9 -  Measure from the top rail to align each bottom rail on each post.             ADDING RAILS TO FENCE POSTS                   Attach a top and bottom rail to the fence posts (Fig. 7). There are three basic ways to do this.                     The center illustration shows the top rail being nailed to the top of the post. This is an ideal installation for many types of fencing structures. The top rail can always be joined to another rail in the center of a post this way.                     If the rail is added on the body of the post rather than at the top, attach it with a groove, a wood block or a metal bracket.                     You can attach the bottom rail to the post by either of the two outside illustrations.                     Fig. 8 illustrates several other ways to attach a rail to a fence post. Study these illustrations carefully. The type of joint you use to attach the fence supports to the post depends primarily on the type of fence you are building.                     The lap joint is one of the easiest to use. The grooved joint does basically the same job, but the rail is grooved into the post rather than being nailed to the post surface.                     The butt joint is a little more difficult to make but is often better. The mortised joint is even neater than the butt joint, but you must cut a mortise into the post for this joint.                     The slotted joint is commonly used on decorative fences. Treat all slotted joints with preservative to prevent rotting in the grooved areas.                     Take time to measure from the top rail to be sure the bottom rail on each is in perfect alignment (Fig. 9). After you have measured one post, cut a measuring stick to prevent having to make an actual measurement on each post. The stick can be used to apply the same measurement to each post.                                    STEP 4               FIG. 10  - Fences like these provide a barrier but offer little privacy.                    FIG. 11  - Barriers like these can enhance the appearance of your yard.                    FIG. 12  - These fences are primarily usedto provide privacy.                    FIG. 13  - These four easy-to-build styles of fence have the same basic construction.                    FIG. 14  - Picket fences can be styled in many ways.

FIG. 17  - This board fence is easy to build.              SELECTING THE FENCE STYLE                   There are literally hundreds of variations in fence styles and construction materials. There is pre-assembled wood fencing sections as well as fencing materials made from recycled milk jugs. The type of fence you use depends primarily on the purpose.                     Fences like the type shown in Fig. 10 are used primarily for barriers. They are easy to build and provide an adequate barrier. However, they are usually not very decorative and they provide very little, if any, privacy.                     Fences like those illustrated in Fig. 11 provide barriers and are more attractive than an ordinary fence. With a little shrubbery or plants, such fences can provide very attractive barriers along property lines.                     Fences such as those illustrated in Fig. 12 are primarily privacy screens. They can be built as tall as needed out of many different materials. Their primary purpose is privacy.                     Consider your needs when selecting the style of your fence. If you want a simple barrier, a wire fence or a simple style fence such as illustrated in Fig. 10 will work fine.                     For a barrier that enhances the appearance, consider styles similar to those illustrated in Fig. 11.                     For added privacy, consider the styles illustrated in Fig. 12.                     Regardless of the type of fence you plan to build, be sure you know exactly where your property line is located. If you are uncertain about the location of the line, check into it or work out an agreement on the fence location with your neighbor.                     Also, check any local ordinances applying to fences before beginning construction. Call the building department of your local city hall or ask for the local government office that regulates construction to be sure you abide by city codes.                     Try to keep the bottom rail of any fence at least 2"" above the ground. This helps eliminate the problem of decay and makes it easier to trim grass around the base of the fence.                     Fig. 13 illustrates four basic styles of easy-to-build fence. Each style has the same basic top, center and bottom rail construction. However, the fences look entirely different with the various rail treatments.                     Study the designs in Fig. 13 carefully. Decide which of these styles you prefer, or use a little imagination and create your own fencing design to apply to the basic rail fencing structure.                     Picket fences are very popular and easy to build. With a little ingenuity you can create attractive picket designs. Study the designs in Fig. 14. Use the designs shown in Fig. 14 or your own designs to create a distinctive picket fence.                     Make sure that all the pickets are spaced by inserting a loose picket between the picket previously nailed into position and the picket to be nailed. Use this easy method throughout the entire fencing construction.                     A basket weave fence is often used on a sloping terrain (Fig. 16). This style of fence allows you to raise or lower each post.                     Use a good-quality board to build a basket weave fence. Boards full of knots may break easily when placed under the stress of basket weaving.                     A simple board fence is easy to build and can be quite attractive (Fig. 17). You can place the boards on one side or alternate them from side to side.                     The board fence provides both a barrier and privacy. It can be built as tall as needed and then stained, painted or left natural.                     You can design a siding fence to match the siding on your home of this style. In fact, you can use the same siding that was used on the home to build the fence.                     The siding fence can be covered on one side or both. Then, you can paint it to match or harmonize with the paint on your home.                     These are only a few of the many styles of fencing available. Fences are easy to build, and the materials are readily available.                                       DISCLAIMER: Check your state and local codes before starting any project.

You're out in the fresh air, the project goes quickly, and it gives you a chance to gab with your neighbors. Our basic design sets the boards inside the posts, so both sides look equally good, which your neighbors will appreciate especially if the fence is near the property line. Add lattice to the top of our basic design, and you get a fence that's downright elegant.    Build It Right    In most communities, you don't need a permit to build a fence that's off the property line and 6 feet high or less. But check your local building codes to be sure. Likewise, talk to your neighbors before anything is set (literally) in concrete. You might save yourself a lot of grief.   Softwoods such as redwood, cedar and cypress are best for fences because they resist rot. The Uniform Building Code specifies using either foundation-grade redwood or pressure-treated Douglas fir–larch, in both cases grade No. 2 or better. First-rate, rot-resistant fence wood can be hard to come by, but it's easy to find pressure-treated lumber (also called CCA wood), which has had rot-resisting chemicals forced into it under pressure. Make sure that any wood that touches the ground has a .40 retention rating, which indicates that the chemical treatment is strong enough to protect wood in constant contact with soil or concrete.             Step by Step     1. Lay out the fence.  Locate the ends of the fence and use a hand sledge to drive sturdy stakes or pipes where the end posts will be. Then stretch a mason's line between the stakes. If your fence is 30 feet or more, drive additional stakes every 15 feet or so, aligned with the end stakes. Otherwise, the wind could blow your mason's line and you could end up with a bowed fence. Stretch the mason's line from stake to stake, 3 feet or so above the ground, wrapping it around each stake in the same direction. When you're done, the line should be straight and run along the same face of each stake.           2. Mark and dig the post holes.  With a tape measure and felt-tip marker, measure and mark post locations on the mason's line. For our fence, we spaced posts every 6 feet. Use a plumb bob to plumb these marks down to earth. Mark the post centers on the ground with spray paint or scrap-wood stakes. When you've set the post locations, dig the post holes as shown in the animation, making each hole 2 feet deep and 1 foot wide. (For more on this, see How to Dig a Post Hole.) Note that hand diggers can handle roots up to a half-inch or so, and power diggers can munch through bigger roots and small rocks. But keep a pick and shovel handy you'll need them when the inevitable big rock or root bars your way. Always wear safety glasses when breaking up rock or using a power digger.           3. Set the posts.  Add 6 inches of gravel to each hole and place a 4-by-4 post loosely inside it. (If you're using pressure-treated posts, be sure to place an uncut end in the hole; it's loaded with preservative and will last longer.) Seat each post into the gravel an inch or so, then plumb it with a carpenter's level so that the post face is at least 1/4 inch away from the mason's line above. Then, using one face of the post as a guide, drive a foundation stake diagonally into the dirt near the top of the hole. Hammer an 8d double-headed nail through the stake into the post. Check plumb again, drive a second foundation stake in at a right angle to the first, and nail it to the post. (There are many ways to plumb posts, but we like foundation stakes because they allow you to do the job single-handedly.) Work carefully to ensure that each post is 6 feet apart on center from its neighbors, or board spacing could be a problem.   When you've correctly spaced and plumbed all the posts, fill the holes to within a couple of inches of the top with fence post mix, which already contains cement and aggregate all you have to do is add water. (That's easily done in a wheelbarrow: pour in a bag of fence post mix and add water gradually, stirring with a hoe till you get the right consistency.) Tamp the concrete well with a stick or rod, so that it fills evenly around the post. Let the concrete cure overnight, then remove the double-headed nails from the posts and pull out the foundation stakes. Top off the holes with concrete, this time an inch or two above the ground, sloping the outer rim downward from the post so that water will drain away from the wood. Plain concrete at the base of a post can be pretty ugly: aggregate pressed into the wet concrete looks much better.           4. Trim the post tops.  When all the posts are securely set, stretch a chalk line across them and place a line level at its center. Adjust the line to trim all the posts level at about 1/4 inch below the top of the shortest post. Remove the line level, and snap the chalk line to mark the posts. Cut off the posts with a circular saw using the scrap-wood jig shown to guide the cut.    A Tip to Prevent Splits    To prevent wood from splitting when you nail into it, drill pilot holes using a drill bit that's slightly more than half the thickness of the nail shank you're using. For 16d nails, use a 1/8-inch bit; for 8d nails, use a 3/32-inch bit. This is just a rule of thumb, however. The type of wood you're using and how close to the edge you're drilling ultimately determines whether the wood will split. If your workpiece splits even after you've drilled pilot holes, increase your drill bit size incrementally until you find one that keeps the wood intact.           5. Add the rails.  For the basic fence, nail 2-by-4 top rails into place with 16d galvanized box nails, predrilling to prevent splitting. To minimize the number of joints in the top rails, use 12-foot or 14-foot 2-by-4s. Where the pieces meet atop a post, align them so their ends center over the posts, preferably at a 45-degree angle to protect the end grain and minimize weathering.   Next, mark and cut the lower rails. These rails will last longer if they're at least 6 inches above the ground. Level the rails with the longest level you have, and use a combination square to mark rail locations on the posts. Again, predrill nail holes and toenail the rails to the posts with two 16d box nails at each joint. To keep rails from wandering as you toenail them, clamp a scrap-wood stop block to the post as shown.    6. Add the inner frames and boards.  The boards run vertically between posts and rails within a frame of 1-by-1s, as shown in the upper detail drawing. These frames act as stops for the fence boards so they don't wander when you nail them in.   Add one upper stop first. Measure and cut it to fit between the posts, and predrill nail holes in it every 6 inches. Set your combination square to measure 5/8 inch in from one edge of the upper rail, and then use the square to position the upper stop. Nail the stop into place and use a nailset to sink the nail heads. Next, measure, cut and nail the side stops onto the posts, also 5/8 inch in from the same edge as the upper stop. Finish with the bottom stop.   Next, measure and cut your 1-by-6 fence boards to fit between the upper and lower rails. Lay them across sawhorses, mark them with the combination square, and then cut them with a circular saw or a miter saw. If you want the edges of the boards to meet, just plumb the first one and start nailing them into place, checking plumb periodically. If, on the other hand, you want uniform spaces between boards, mark the spacing in pencil on the bottom rail first, so you can make adjustments before you start to nail. Often, the final board in a fence section will need to be cut to fit widthwise. For this, a table saw is best. Toenail the boards into the rails not the 1-by-1s with 8d finishing nails. (For toenailing, predrill holes at a 45-degree angle.) . With the boards in place, add the remaining 1-by-1 stops to finish the fence.           7. Lattice variation.  This design varies in two ways from the basic fence above: it has a middle rail and a section of lattice between the middle and top rail. Toenail the middle rail before you nail the top rail; clamping a scrap-wood stop block onto the post will keep the middle rail from migrating as you nail it. Follow with the top rail and then the bottom. Since each lattice panel has a frame of 1-by-1 stops on either side to hold it in, you'll need an additional set of 1-by-1s. Because lattice strips are thin and easily split, nail them with 4d nails rather than the 8d nails you're using for the boards. (You can save some money by cutting four 1-foot lattice panels from a single 4-by-8-foot panel.) The lattice is especially beautiful with trumpet creeper or jasmine intertwined through it.

In addition to providing value to your home it increases your security and privacy. You'll find it's not a difficult job and I will show you the easy method of building your fence.                                                                           Building a wood fence can be a fun and rewarding project. In addition to providing value to your home it increases your security and privacy. You'll find it's not a difficult job and I will show you the easy method of building your fence.    Materials Needed:    Treatment preservative  Concrete  4x4 posts 8 feet in length.  2x4 for railing in either 8 or 16 feet in length  1x6 or 1x8 fence boards (your preference)  3 1/2"" galvanized nails  2 1/2"" flat head galvanized nails  Hardware for gate (hinges and latch)    Before you get started you must first figure out your  fence  line. This will help you calculate the materials needed to build your fence. When determining your fence line the best thing to do is talk to your neighbors. If you're in disagreement you can look for the property survey markers or if all else fails have your property surveyed. It's best to keep the entire fence on your property. Once you know the fence line mark it with a string line. Using stakes hammered into the ground run the line 2 feet past each end of the fence line. Secure the string tightly to the stakes.    Next you need to treat your posts by following the manufacturers recommendations. I would suggest treatment at least 8 inches above ground level. You can also purchase posts that are pre-treated from your lumber store if you wish.    Measure your post holes 8 feet apart. I wouldn't recommend any further apart as through time your fence may sag or lean. Dig the holes about 28 inches deep. Make sure all posts are of equal distance apart. It's now time to prepare your concrete for setting the posts. Mix your concrete with 1 part cement, 2 parts sand and 3 parts gravel. Add water and mix to a thick consistency but at the same time wet enough to pour all the way around the posts. Fill each hole 6 inches deep. Now it's time to place the posts in every hole. Use a level to make sure each post is plumb and barely touching the string. Finish filling each hole to about 2 inches below ground level. Double check each post making sure it's plumb.     After the posts have set it's time to add the railings. Make sure to set the bottom rail 8 inches above ground and be careful to have both ends the same height from the ground. Fasten the top rails by measuring from the bottom rail up to the desired position. Finally attach the middle rail central between the bottom and top rails.     Before you nail the boards to the railings you might want to consider staining or painting them first as it is easier than doing this after they've been fastened. If you decide to go this route you should also stain or paint the posts and rails prior to attaching the boards. Using a spacer to maintain equal gaps you can begin nailing the boards to the rails, using 2 of the 2 1/2 inch nails hammered on each rail. Use a level to make sure the boards are vertically plumb.    Now that your fence is up you probably want a gate. First you need to determine the size of the gate. I would recommend a gate no less than 3 feet wide. You should build a frame with the 2x4's overlapping and attach a middle rail for durability and strength. To allow room for the hinges and latch make sure the gate frame is built allowing 1 inch narrower between the gate posts. Next attach the fence boards and finally install the hinges and latch.    That's all there is to it. Now it's time to take a break and enjoy the beautiful fence you've just built.      ArticleSource:  ArticlesAlley.com            About the author     Jerry Holt is a writer for the website Do It Yourself Today.

My son-in-law and daughter said they     would be glad to install it for me....then I find out he has NO idea of how to do it (he     DOES know how to operate the post hole digger!).  So I took a chance that I might     find some help on ""the NET"".  I never imagined there was such a helpful     site out there!   The information I printed out would almost enable a blind person to     put a fence up.   This is great! Thank you so much!!!!!  I think we will be fine     now.  I thank you and my Rottweiler baby, Greta thanks you too.      ~Pauline Doudrick       *Thanks Pauline, Glad we could help!

Keep in mind some areas may require a specific distance     offset from the fence line.      Mark the center of holes with paint or a stake.      Posts are normally spaced 10' maximum.  If you want to put privacy slats in     chain link consider 8' spacing for     Dig holes 6"" diameter by 30 to 36"" deep (or     below frost line in your area). Don't make holes too shallow.  For larger diameter     posts dig the diameter of  the holes about 3 times the diameter of the post.      Restretch string and check holes for accuracy by     placing a post in the hole and plumbing in all directions.  If the hole needs     'shaved' or moved, do it now.  If holes are shallow because you hit an object you     can't remove,  'bell' the hole at the bottom.  That is to enlarge the bottom     bigger than the top diameter.  This will compensate for holes as shallow as 18""     deep.  If necessary move the hole to miss the obstruction.  This will change     your post spacing.  However, there is no harm in the case of line posts.  If you     must move it more than a couple of feet, consider installing an extra post midway on the     enlarged space.  Occasionally posts can be welded on plates and actually bolted to     rock, when they are shallower than 12-18"".      Mix concrete with water using pre-mixed bag.  Go     easy on the water.  Mix should look like thick gray mud, not like Mom's watered-down     chili.  If it doesn't pile up on the shovel, it's too thin; add more mix to dry it     up.  If you are mixing from scratch using aggregate like gravel, limestone or sea     shells, concrete sand and portland cement, mix 3 to 4 parts (shovels) of aggregate to 2     parts sand and 1 part cement.      Mark post grade mark.  End, corner and gate     posts should be marked at the height of the fence plus 1 inch;  49"" for a 4'     fence, 61"" for a 5' fence, etc.  Mark intermediate or line posts at height of     the fence minus 3 inches; 45"" for 4' fence, 57"" for 5' fence, etc.  When     you add your line post cap and top rail, the height will be proper.  These     measurements represent how much of the post is out of the ground.  In no case set the     posts below these marks (unless you are willing to dig to bury the fence).  You can     set them higher to allow for short span dips in the ground. Remember, if in doubt: It     is easy to cut a post off; it's not so easy to make it longer.      Have your helper (best friend or wife) hold the post     perfectly plumb in the hole.  Fill  the concrete carefully around the post to     3"" below the ground (my wife does the shoveling).  Adjust height of post to the     grade mark or higher.  Backfill dirt around the post level to the ground.  Step     on it to pack and plumb post as needed.  That's one down.  Repeat for all posts     in a particular line of fence from end post to end post.  Adjust heights of all posts     so they are as straight across the top as you view the entire line.  Do not push one     to low as described above.  Most lots are not graded perfectly level, just attempt to     make smooth transitions from one post to the next.  You don't want the top to rise     and fall from post to post, unless absolutely necessary.  Keep grade marks tight to     ground, if you want the fence to contain a dog.  If you want a space under the fence,     leave the post up higher intentionally.  In fact, if you desire 2 inch space under,     mark your grade marks 2 inch longer than described previously.      Install gate posts with the exact opening size as     recommended by gate supplier or manufacturer.  The opening size is the distance     between the two gate posts.  If possible make the tops of gate posts level to each     other by placing a post across the tops of the posts and checking with a level.  If     the ground slopes off sharply under the gate, set the gate posts to grade.  It won't     look proper to make them level.      Let concrete get hard for atleast a few days before     contin         Install Fittings                    Place tension bands on end and corner posts.      Put  'quantity = height minus one' tension bands     per hookup; minimum of three.      A  hookup  is each connection to an end or     corner post.      The tension bands are offset.  The offset goes     on the same side as the chain link fabric will be installed.  This is normally the     outside of the enclosed area.      Place one brace band per hookup over the tension     bands.  This fitting requires one rail end cup, one bolt and nut.      The rail end cup is offset also.  This offset     can be up or down on an end post.  On a corner, since two sets of brace bands and     rail end cups must share the same space, the bottom rail end cup is to be offset up and     the bottom rail end cup is to be offset down.  This enables the two cups to be level     to each other, so your top rail can be inserted into the cups and be level to each other.      Put all bolts in with theuts on the inside of the     enclosed area, opposite the chain link and tension band offset. That way someone outside     the finished fence can't remove the nuts.      Place caps on posts.  The ends and corners are     simple. They only go on one way (my wife puts those on).  The loop caps, as they are     called, are offset, if you look at them carefully.  The offset side faces the outside     of the enclosure; the same side as the chain link will be installed.      Do not put bolts in tension bands at this time.      Save gate hinges for later also.          Install Top Rail                Slide top rail through loop caps on line posts     starting at one end.      Some top rail has a 'swedged' end, which tapers down     so it will fit into another piece of rail.  Fit the non-swedged end into the rail end     cup at the end or corner post.      Add sections of rail, sliding each non-swedged end     into a swedged end.  Be certain to push rails toward your beginning point to 'seat'     them all the way into each other.  Push firmly. If the top rail has no swedged end     then you need a  'sleeve'  that acts as a coupling.      Add rail to next end or corner post      Cut excess rail off with hack saw or pipe cutter.      Mark the cut-off point carefully so the rail will fit snugly into the rail end cup,     by using the installed rail end cup, and marking the rail at the back of the cup.  It     is important to have a tight fit.  Any slack in your entire length of rail will allow     the chain link, when stretched tight, to pull the end posts in towards each other.      Install top rail in all stretches of fence.          Stretch Chain Link         Weaving The Chain Link Fabric           Starting at one end of a line of fence, roll chain     link out on the outside of the enclosed area or the side you previously have chosen.      Roll out another roll, if more is needed to reach the     next end post.  Chain link is stretched in one continuous length of woven chain link     from end post to end post.      'Weave'  chain link rolls together.  This     can be a little tricky, if never done before.  This requires some explanation.       Each weave is continuous from the top to     the bottom along the vertical or height of the roll.  If you follow the strand,     starting at the top, you will see that it zig-zags back and forth to the bottom.  It     starts and ends with either a 'knuckle' or a 'twisted'       To remove a weave, unbend the end of the weave     'knuckle' straight.  Unbend the adjacent weave that is knuckled to it.  If it     has a twisted end, simply untwist the two weaves until they can be separated.       Follow the weave to the other end as it     zig-zags back and forth and untwist or unknuckle the opposite end.  Be certain you     follow carefully, so you undo the proper weave.       At the top of the fence or the bottom, spin the     weave in a counter-clockwise direction, as if to unscrew it from the roll.  Most     newly manufactured chain link spins out counter-clockwise, whereas some chain link     manufactured years ago spins out clockwise.  Continue spinning and you will see the     other end unweaving from it's adjacent weaves.  If you are having difficulty, you may     have disconnected the wrong weaves at the opposite end,  you may have not bent the     other end straight enough and it keeps snagging as you try to spin it or the chain link is     stretched to tight along the ground; give yourself some slack.      The procedure for weaving to rolls together is just     the oppositeexcept it can be tricky getting started.      To start weaving : Chain link forms squares or     diamonds.  They are called diamonds. You must match two sections or rolls together     before you start weaving, in such a way that one roll has a full diamond and the other     roll has a half diamond, so when you add a weave, you will end up with a full diamond and     two ends to knuckle or twist together.      Spin the single weave into the first full diamond on     the full diamond roll.  Spin it through the next full diamond of the other roll.      Continue spinning and make certain that the weave end goes through each full diamond     on each roll in each revolution.      If you have trouble: Your chain link is too tight;     give some slack,  you missed a diamond somewhere or you may have mismatched rolls     that came from different manufacturer's or the rolls have different mesh sizes.      Count the number of full diamonds in each roll.  They should be the same.      Hopefully you have successfully woven the two rolls     together.  Twist or re-knuckle the ends together.  If you have no counter weave     to fasten to, you started with either two half diamonds on each roll or two full diamonds     on each roll.  Take it apart and try again.  Sometimes you have to flip the one     roll over (most have a half diamond at one end and a full diamond at the other) or remove     a weave from one roll to create a starting half or full diamond.               Stretching The Fabric          After rolling out the chain link and weaving the     rolls together, 'hookup' one end. Space the tension bands evenly as illustrated above     (figure F51). Make sure the nuts are on the inside of the fence so they can not be removed     from outside the enclosure.     If you have a sharp incline approaching a terminal     post, the fabric must be cut on the end. This is called a 'bias cut'. See  details  on how to make a bias cut     in chain link fabric.     Pull the chain link tight by hand to the other end.     You may stand the chain link and lean it against the posts or leave it on the ground and     lean it up as you stretch the fabric later. Generally the later is easier and better on     long stretches.      Hookup stretch tools as illustrated (figure F51).     Make sure the come-a-long hook faces away from the fabric or it will get caught in the     diamonds.      Tighten the come-a-long slowly. Check that the fabric     is not getting caught on posts, tree roots or other obstacles. If you haven't already done     so, lean the      ' Dress ' the fabric as you tighten it. ' Dressing '     involves straightening the fabric diamonds so they run true. Some spots will be higher     than others as you sight down the top. Lift the fabric in the low spots. This must be done     before the fabric gets too tight. Once it is tight, little can be done to straighten the     fabric. Some fabric dresses easily, some does not. If the fabric does not dress up     properly, you can always loosen the come-a-long and try again.      The fabric is tight enough when you can't squeeze the     diamonds together with one hand. Do not over stretch or post damage will occur. The top of     the fence should 'snap' back to the posts when pulled out a little.      Hand stretch the small section left at the     come-a-long. Cut the excess fabric off. Slide the tension bar into the mesh and make your     last hookup. Once all bolts are in place, remove the stretching tools.           Tie Off The Fabric         Install tie wires onto top rail first to establish     the height of the fence. Space tie wires no more bsp;than 2' apart.      Tie line posts last. Use the same number per post as     tension bands. This quantity is a minimum (1 per foot).      The fabric top diamond should be centered on the top     rail. It can be lowered or raised slightly if desired.     Click  HERE      for an animation of how to tie a tie wire.         Install Gates               Install female hinges on gates. Space them the     maximum distance apart as possible.      Hold gate in opening and mark the location of male     hinges. Point the hinge on the bottom up and the one on top down.      Install bottom hinge and tighten only until it is     just snug (you may have to move it). Once again, the nuts belong inside the fence     enclosure.      Install top hinge. Do not tighten.      Place gate on bottom hinge and lower top male hinge     into female hinge.      If the space under the gate is acceptable. Tighten     top male hinge just snug.      Test swing the gate to see if it will miss the     ground. Adjust as needed.      Tighten All hinge bolts. Do not over tighten. When     the bolts begin to bend....stop.      Install the latch (nuts inside).      In the case of a double swing gate, install the gate     closest to the ground first, unless the ground is perfectly level. Hang second gate level     to the first.      Install double gate drop rod/latch assembly.      Install center stop for double swing gate. Close the     double gate, making certain the two leaves are lined up (straight). Mark the ground where     the center stop needs to be installed by pushing the drop rod into the ground. Open the     gate and pound a piece of 1 5/8"" O.D. pipe flush to the ground. Proceed slowly,     checking the gate to make certain you are driving the pipe straight. There are special     fittings available to use for more sophisticated center stops. If  the center stop is     in a concrete drive, simply drill a hole in the concrete larger than the drop rod diameter     and do not use a pipe. Always make a much larger hole (or pipe size) than the diameter of     the drop rod to allow for gate sag, posts shifting, ice and other factors.       Good luck with your project!

clueweb09-en0011-84-33753	"                                                                        Here are tips and suggestions on how to build wood fences. These tips can save you time, money and effort. Read all suggestions carefully before beginning the job.                                SPACING THE FENCE POSTS           As a rule, you should set fence posts about 6' to 8' apart. The spacing of the posts         depends on the type of fence you build, the terrain, the purpose of the fence, and other         such factors.         Set the corner or end post first. Then stretch a line from each corner or end post to         align all the posts in between.         Drive a stake every 6' to 8' at the exact position where the post hole is to be dug         (Fig. 1).         Take time to measure and position the posts accurately. The appearance and the         structural strength of your fence depends a great deal on the positioning of the fence         posts.                                                                           SETTING THE FENCE POSTS           Set all wood fence posts with about 1/3 of their total length buried in the ground. This         is especially important on corner posts and any posts that will carry heavy weight or         withstand high wind pressure.         Use a regular post hole digger to dig the post holes. Dig the holes straight to the         proper depth at each stake marker.         You can anchor the posts more firmly by making the holes slightly larger at the bottom         than at the top (Fig. 2). Place a large stone or two shovels full of gravel in the bottom         of each hole. This provides drainage to avoid excessive moisture at the base of each post.         Use a wood preservative to treat the section of the post that will be underground. Allow         the post to stand overnight in the preservative so it can become well-saturated.         You can pack the posts with either dirt or concrete. In either case, place two or three         shovels full of gravel in the bottom of each hole before the post is placed into position.         Be sure the posts are in an exact, upright position (Fig. 3). You can check the         alignment of each post with a regular level. You can also check the alignment of the posts         in one direction by sighting from one end of the row of posts to the other.         Brace each post with stakes after it is properly aligned (Fig. 3). Keep the stakes in         position until the concrete (if used) has thoroughly set. Remove the nails holding the         braces and readjust the post until it is in accurate alignment.         When the post is properly aligned, tamp it thoroughly to pack the dirt (if used) around         the base of the post. Be sure you do not alter the alignment of the post during the         tamping process.         When the post is firmly in position, build a mound around it to help eliminate water         standing at the post base (Fig. 4). Slope the concrete slightly away from the post and         round it off with a trowel. Tamp the concrete lightly to eliminate any air bubbles left in         the mixture that can act as water pockets.         Provide extra bracing at all corners (Fig. 5). A corner post must carry the weight of         fence stretched in two directions, so it should be set in both directions.         Allow the posts to stand several days and settle firmly in position before adding the         fence.         The heads of posts should be rounded, capped or slanted to help eliminate accumulating         water, which can cause rotting. This is well-worth the effort since it allows the posts to         last.                                                                           ADDING RAILS TO FENCE POSTS           Attach a top and bottom rail to the fence posts (Fig. 7). There are three basic ways to         do this.         The center illustration shows the top rail being nailed to the top of the post. This is         an ideal installation for many types of fencing structures. The top rail can always be         joined to another rail in the center of a post this way.         If the rail is added on the body of the post rather than at the top, attach it with a         groove, a wood block or a metal bracket.         You can attach the bottom rail to the post by either of the two outside illustrations.         Fig. 8 illustrates several other ways to attach a rail to a fence post. Study these         illustrations carefully. The type of joint you use to attach the fence supports to the         post depends primarily on the type of fence you are building.         The lap joint is one of the easiest to use. The grooved joint does basically the same         job, but the rail is grooved into the post rather than being nailed to the post surface.         The butt joint is a little more difficult to make but is often better. The mortised         joint is even neater than the butt joint, but you must cut a mortise into the post for         this joint.         The slotted joint is commonly used on decorative fences. Treat all slotted joints with         preservative to prevent rotting in the grooved areas.         Take time to measure from the top rail to be sure the bottom rail on each is in perfect         alignment (Fig. 9). After you have measured one post, cut a measuring stick to prevent         having to make an actual measurement on each post. The stick can be used to apply the same         measurement to each post.                                                                                                   SELECTING THE FENCE STYLE           There are literally hundreds of variations in fence styles and construction materials.         There is pre-assembled wood fencing sections as well as fencing materials made from         recycled milk jugs. The type of fence you use depends primarily on the purpose.         Fences like the type shown in Fig. 10 are used primarily for barriers. They are easy to         build and provide an adequate barrier. However, they are usually not very decorative and         they provide very little, if any, privacy.         Fences like those illustrated in Fig. 11 provide barriers and are more attractive than         an ordinary fence. With a little shrubbery or plants, such fences can provide very         attractive barriers along property lines.         Fences such as those illustrated in Fig. 12 are primarily privacy screens. They can be         built as tall as needed out of many different materials. Their primary purpose is privacy.         Consider your needs when selecting the style of your fence. If you want a simple         barrier, a wire fence or a simple style fence such as illustrated in Fig. 10, will work         fine.         For a barrier that enhances the appearance, consider styles similar to those illustrated         in Fig. 11.         For added privacy, consider the styles illustrated in Fig. 12.         Regardless of the type of fence you plan to build, be sure you know exactly where your         property line is located. If you are uncertain about the location of the line, check into         it or work out an agreement on the fence location with your neighbor.         Also, check any local ordinances applying to fences before beginning construction. Call         the building department of your local city hall or ask for the local government office         that regulates construction to be sure you abide by city codes.         Try to keep the bottom rail of any fence at least 2"" above the ground. This helps         eliminate the problem of decay and makes it easier to trim grass around the base of the         fence.         Fig. 13 illustrates four basic styles of easy-to-build fence. Each style has the same         basic top, center and bottom rail construction. However, the fences look entirely         different with the various rail treatments.         Study the designs in Fig. 13 carefully. Decide which of these styles you prefer, or use         a little imagination and create your own fencing design to apply to the basic rail fencing         structure.         Picket fences are very popular and easy to build. With a little ingenuity you can create         attractive picket designs. Study the designs in Fig. 14. Use the designs shown in Fig. 14         or your own designs to create a distinctive picket fence.         Make sure that all the pickets are spaced by inserting a loose picket between the picket         previously nailed into position and the picket to be nailed. Use this easy method         throughout the entire fencing construction.         A basket weave fence is often used on a sloping terrain (Fig. 16). This style of fence         allows you to raise or lower each post.         Use a good-quality board to build a basket weave fence. Boards full of knots may break         easily when placed under the stress of basket weaving.         A simple board fence is easy to build and can be quite attractive (Fig. 17). You can         place the boards on one side or alternate them from side to side.         The board fence provides both a barrier and privacy. It can be built as tall as needed         and then stained, painted or left natural.         You can design a siding fence to match the siding on your home of this style. In fact,         you can use the same siding that was used on the home to build the fence.         The siding fence can be covered on one side or both. Then, you can paint it to match or         harmonize with the paint on your home.          These are only a few of the many styles of fencing available. Fences are easy to build,         and the materials are readily available.

First,                    make a sketch of your yard and include areas such as patios                    and existing walkways, as you can easily fit small raised beds                    in these areas. For example, this  cedar                    planter box  perfect if you want to grow a full garden in                    a small space.                                        Drafting paper and color pencils can help you visualize your                    design and you can easily distinguish landscape features such                    as turf, walkways, trees, etc. with different colors. Try and                    make your drawing to scale if possible so that you can measure                    the available spaces you have to set up your raised beds.                                        While many raised beds are portable, in some cases you’ll                    want to build large, permanent raised beds. That’s why                    it’s important to observe your yard during a full day                    and during different seasons so that you can make note of areas                    of sun and shade.                                         Next, write a list of the plants you want to grow in your garden.                    The design and location of your raised beds can depend largely                    on your plant selection. For example, if you want to grow a                    collection of sun-loving plants, you’ll need to place                    your raised beds where you’ll maximize sun exposure.                                         Now that you have a sketch of your property, you’ll need                    to design your raised beds so that they fit your needs.                                            Raised                    Bed Dimensions                     A good basic design for the serious gardener is a raised                    bed 4 feet wide and 20 feet long. This design will give you                    80 square feet of growing space which is ideal for growing a                    large amount of fruits and vegetables. Three feet wide and two                    to three feet high are suggested for most gardeners who want                    to stand or sit in a chair while gardening.                   To                    customize your raised beds to your own needs, use the following                    raised bed design guide.                                        Length:                       When planning the length of your bed, the most important factor                      is your available space. Moreover, longer is not necessarily                      better. Two medium length beds with a space between them will                      make it easier to walk around the beds and work your plants                      from both sides. Also, it’s a good idea to allow a space                      at each end of the bed to walk around.                                             Width:  To calculate the width of your raised                      bed, sit at a table you’d feel comfortable working at                      and reach out your hands until you begin to bend over slightly.                      Measure this distance and write it down. If you want to place                      your raised bed next to a building and work just from one                      side, use this measurement for the width. If you plan on making                      a freestanding bed where you can garden from all sides, double                      the measurement. Likewise, if you plan on working while standing,                      perform the measurement listed above while standing.                                             Depth:  A bed eight to nine inches deep works                      for most herbs, annuals, and some vegetables. Make the bed                      deeper if you plan on growing deep-rooted vegetables, fruits,                      ornamentals, or shrubs.                      Height:                       You can design your raised bed so that you can work standing                      or sitting in a chair or bench. On average, 2 ½ - 3                      feet high works for most people. To personalize your garden                      beds, sit in a comfortable chair that you’d use for                      typing and measure to where you hands can easily reach. Make                      your garden bed this height. The same technique can be used                      for measuring a standing position. If you have several people                      who enjoy gardening in your home, make sure to take an average                      height so that the bed is good for everyone.                                                           Raised Bed Foundation, Spacing, and                    Orientation                    When you’re thinking about locations for your beds, remember                    that you’ll be walking and working around your raised                    beds. It’s important that you have an appropriate, level                    base for your beds. You can also think about installing brick                    pathways or stepping stones around your beds. Gravel mulch is                    also a good option. A paved concrete walkway may be appropriate                    for some yards.                                         Maximize sunlight with a north-south orientation. With unusually                    tall plants, an east-west setup may work better. It’s                    very important to have proper spacing between your beds so that                    you can walk and work around them. Make enough space between                    your beds to allow for a wheelbarrow, lawn mower, or whatever                    large equipment you may need to move around your garden.                                        Once you’ve got an idea of the size and the orientation                    you’d like for your beds, it’s time to sketch out                    your raised beds and see how they fit in the larger scheme of                    your garden. Add your raised beds to the drawing of your yard.                    Try putting them at 90 angles, or several in a row. You can                    also set up several rows of smaller raised beds. Play around                    a bit before deciding on a final design for your raised bed                    garden.                                            Appropriate                  Materials for Building Raised Beds                   You can make raised beds from such common materials as concrete                    blocks, bricks, railroad ties, pressure treated lumber, etc.                    Railroad ties need to be completely dry before using, as leaking                    creosote can affect your plants. Pressure-treated lumber may                    be unsafe for use in the garden if treated with such chemicals                    as pentachlorophenol. Be safe, and  check out this U.S. government                    site about the hazards of using treated wood in the garden .                                     Kits                    are available so that you can easily build your own  raised                    bed from beautiful hardwoods like cedar . You can also buy                    kits that are made from polyethylene blocks that look like natural                    stone and work pretty well.                    You can find a complete selection of  raised bed gardening kits  at Clean Air Gardening.                                                                                               Choosing Plants for Raised Beds                   Picking plants for your raised bed is basically the                    same as with a regular garden bed, with a few differences. For                    example, you have to take into account the depth of your bed                    when choosing plants for your raised beds. If you’ve got                    a rather shallow bed, you’ll be limited to annuals, herbs,                    and some veggies. The deeper your bed, the more options you’ll                    have for growing plants in your raised bed.                   Also,                    it’s always a good idea to consider the needs of each                    one of your plants such as pH, light levels, water, the chemical                    composition of your soil, etc. Remember that you can take advantage                    of your raised beds by planting vegetables and fruits closer                    together than in a traditional garden bed.                    It’s                    important to place plants with similar needs in the same raised                    bed. You don’t want to grow shade loving plants alongside                    sun loving plants. You can also separate different kinds of                    plants in the same bed with the addition of a wooden plank or                    similar division, but make sure there sunlight and watering                    needs are similar.                    These                     smaller                    raised beds  are appropriate for a small collection of plants.                    Several of these raised beds placed on a patio or deck will                    allow you to grow many different kinds of plants.

Have you gone green? It seems everything has gone green lately including the Oscars. With Al Gore's environmental Nobel prize and more and more celebrities jumping on the green bandwagon, we're going to hear about ways we can make our lives more environmentally reponsible. In new home construction, installing a composting toilet is one way to have less negative impact on the environment.       How a Composting Toilet Works       Composting toilets are also knows as waterless, dry or biological toilets. A composting toilet breaks down human waste into humus, a soil-like substance kind of like what you find on the forest floor. Aerobic bacteria breaks down the waste. After the waste has been properly composted, it can be used as a soil additive around fruit trees and other garden areas.       Composting toilets are not connected to a septic or sewer system; they are completely contained. Now, if you've never heard of a composting toilet before, you're probably thinking that it sounds pretty disgusting and smelly. But actually, a composting toilet that is properly installed will not emit an odor, and it is very sanitary.       The Parts of the Composting Toilet       The composting toilet consists of three parts: a place to sit like a normal toilet, a composting chamber where waste is broken down and sanitized, and a drying chamber which reduces the amount of sewage by allowing moisture to evaporate. Some composting toilets are completely automatic with an electric crank that turns the composting material after the toilet has been used. Other models are manual, requiring the person to turn a crank a few times to stir the compost after use. This aerates the material, adding oxygen which is needed by the aerobic bacteria to break down the waste.                                                                             Removing the Compost       After the composting chamber becomes full usually every six months or so, it is removed and replaced with an empty one. The full composting chamber is left to continue the composting process. After a year the material inside is fully composted and ready to be used for a soil additive. Some models have rotating chambers, thus eliminating the need to manually remove chambers as often.       Why Use One       Every time we flush an ordinary toilet, we flush away gallons of usable water. Composting toilets use little or no water, thus preserving our natural water resources. Since the waste composts into a usable material, it is not run through a sewer treatment plant, which requires the addition of chemicals into our water systems. And, for those people who wish to live  off the grid  and are not dependent on the government for their sewer and septic, a composting toilet is a way of becoming more self-sufficient.       A composting toilet is a different way of thinking about sewage and a way to make your home more environmentally friendly.                                                                         Rate this Article         Click on the stars below to rate this article from 1 to 5                                                                                                    Thank You For Voting                                               Share This Page     URL:          Share this page with friends on:       del.icio.us      |     digg it!          |     reddit!          |   Google!                           Related Articles:            What is a composting toilet?

Installing a new toilet is actually a rather simple plumbing procedure that can be accomplished in just a few steps. To install the new toilet, you'll need a new toilet gasket and two 5/16-inch bolts to mount the bowl to the floor flange, but most of the required parts will be included with the new toilet.   When removing the old toilet, shut off the water supply to the tank and flush the toilet. Use a bucket or cloth to remove any leftover water in the tank and bowl. Using a pair of pliers or small pipe wrench, remove the nut connecting the water line to the ballcock valve at the bottom, left side of the tank.                 Use a small crescent wrench to remove the two nuts that hold the bowl to the floor flange. Once the nuts are removed, lift and remove the old toilet.    Click screen to play a tutorial video on installing a toilet:                             1.  The exposed flange is the mounting base for your new toilet. Discard the old bolts.       2.  First, place the two new, 5/16-inch bolts in the holes located on the sides of the exposed flange, with the bolt heads inside the flange. Position the bolts straight up and across from each other. Then put the new toilet gasket (wax ring) on the flange, with the flat side pointing up, if tapered.        3.  Lower the new bowl straight down, centering it on the wax ring and making sure both bolts come though the holes on each side of the bowl. Apply pressure straight down, pushing the bowl over the ring and flange, squeezing the wax to create a seal and mounting the bowl flush with the floor.        4.  Add washers and nuts to the protruding bolts and tighten until snug. (Over-tightening can crack the bowl).       5.  To install the toilet's tank, push two 5/16-by-3-inch mounting bolts through the small holes on the tank's bottom. Place rubber washers just beneath the bolt heads inside the tank to create a watertight seal. Add nuts and washers to the bolts on the underside of the tank and tighten until snug.       6.  Apply the sponge-rubber gasket (with small side down if beveled) over the discharge tube where the tank sets on the bowl.        7.  Set the tank on the bowl, threading the bolts into the bolt-holes on the bowl and sandwiching the gasket between the tank and bowl.       8.  Add metal washers and nuts to the bolts where they extend downward from the bottom of the bowl. Hold the tank level and tighten. It may help to hold each bolt stationary with a screwdriver inside the tank while backing up the nut with a crescent wrench on the outside of the bowl.        9.  Install a new toilet-flush handle by screwing the handle to the lift arm, through the handle hole in the tank. Toilet handles are threaded in reverse. Connect the lift arm to the chain of the flushing ball/flapper inside the tank.       10.  Bolt the new toilet lid to the bowl.        11.  Install a new water line from the wall or floor fixture to the feed valve on the underside of the tank. Turn on the water and check for leaks. Give it a couple of trial flushes. If your toilet holds water, tighten the bolts that hold the bowl to the floor. If there's any instability between the tank and bowl, or bowl and floor, use hard rubber shims, usually available at hardware stores, to adjust minor spacing problems and ensure a smooth ride.     12.  Once everything is in place and adjusted, cut the ends off the bowl-mounting bolts to accommodate the plastic bolt caps.  You may want to caulk the base of the bowl to create a waterproof seal, protecting the floor and providing additional stability.   Put on the tank cover, and your new toilet is ready for its maiden voyage.

The first ""paperless toilet"" was invented in Japan in 1980.            The paperless toilet is a combination toilet and bidet. This paperless            toilet dries the user after washing. Approximately 70% of paperless            toilets with seat warmers are found in Japan's households. They are            also found in hotels and even some public facilities.           How does the paperless toilet work?                        First you press the button which gives you the 'Bidet' experience.                                       A spray of warm water which is perfectly aimed.                                        Then another button allows you to change the water temperature.              There are three different settings of water temperature from luke              warm to hot.                                        Then there is another button with 5 settings which allows you to              the water flow from a trickle to a full blast.                                        Of course, curiosity got the better of me and I took a sneaky look              over my shoulder to see how the Bidet actually worked.                                        There is a button to adjust the temperature of the toilet seat,              which has three different heat settings.                                        After all that is done, you select the dryer to complete the paperless              toilet experience.                        History is unsure of who the inventor of the flush toilet is. No matter              who gets the credit of this marvelous new no paper toilet invention,              the toilet has made our lives safe and comfortable.                       Types of Toilets             Type            # 1 Toilet - Gravity Toilet: The gravity tank toilet is a two piece            tank toilet which is commonly used in homes.            Type # 2 Toilet - Pressurized Tank Toilets: This toilet uses water            line pressure to achieve a higher flush velocity. Water is not stored            inside the tank, but in a tank that compresses a pocket of air and releases            pressurized water into the bowl and out the trap way.           Type # 3 Toilet - Flush Valve Operated Toilet: This type of toilet            is usually found in many public and commercial restrooms. This toilet            has no tank. Instead of a water storage tank, this toilet uses a valve            directly connected to the water supply plumbing of a building and this            valve controls the quantity of water released by each flush.                             | Copyright 2007 PaperlessToilet.com - All    Rights Reserved   |           "
clueweb09-en0011-82-35189	"   Please Visit:   The Most Popular Online Plumbing Supplier:     Famous PlumbingSupply.com                Choosing a Toilet   Steve Culpepper   Reproduced with  permission from   Fine Homebuilding  magazine.Oct./Nov. 1997  A head-to-head comparison for our readers with nothing to go on.     A t first the toilets in our house were merely sluggish. Then they got slower and slower until they didn't flush at all.   But the toilets weren't clogged. Something was in the sewer line. So I rented a sewer snake, unscrewed the clean-out and fed the hungry snake down the   chute. In it went 10 ft., 25 ft., 40 ft. Still, the pipe didn't drain. As I pondered the problem, my young son stuck his head out the window, his little   fists full of his favorite action figures, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.   ""Turtles live in the sewer, Daddy,"" he said.     After the snake failed to hit pay dirt, I retracted it and fed a garden hose down the sewer line. When the hose could go no farther, I turned up the pressure   and just let the water eat. The hose had stewed in the sewer no more than  five minutes when a dozen or so plastic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, all   horribly chewed by the sewer snake, burbled to the surface. I coiled up the  hose and broke the news to my son.     Gone are the days when we could flush toys.      After our sewer was deturtled and the attendant blockage removed, our toilets   flushed magnificently. What was amazing was that all those Teenage Mutant   Ninja Turtles could ever have been flushed down the toilet at all. But those   were the days of the 5-gal. flush. With that much water chasing after them,   an entire flotilla of Ninja Turtles could've been flushed home at once-and   might have been.     Times have changed since that unclogging. My son is in high school. The Democrats   are in the White House. Toilet-flushing capacity dropped from 5 gal. to 3.5   gal., down to the current nationally mandated standard of 1.6-gal.     Our old 5-gal. toilets could flush turtles, cigars, feminine-hygiene products,   bullets, Popsicle sticks and an occasional diaper with little effort. The   new 1.6-gal. toilets sometimes struggle to flush our humble daily loads of   human waste. However, the law's the law, as those who favor the law are fond   of saying. And the law is the National Energy Policy Act of 1992, which requires   that all toilets made or sold in this country meet new federal water-efficiency   standards. To conserve water, those standards set the upper limit of a single   flush at 1.6-gal. The law took effect in 1994 for residential toilets and   in 1997 for commercial toilets.       How 1.6-gal. gravity toilets work     Regardless of price or style, all gravity toilets depend on gravity to pull   the water-and waste-through the system (drawing right). When the handle is   pushed, a flush valve opens, and the water in the tank drains into the bowl,   either through rim openings, through the large siphon-jet opening across   from the drain at the bottom of the bowl or through a combination of both.   The gravityfed speed of the water pushes the waste through the trap and into   the drain.   Old 5-gal. toilets and new 1.6-gal. gravity toilets work the same way. The    tank holds the water above the bowl. The lever opens the flush valve, which    lets the water rush out of the tank into the bowl, either through rim holes,    a siphon hole or both. In the bowl, the pressure of the water rushing down    the drain creates a vacuum or siphon effect that draws the waste with it.    Meanwhile, an automatic valve refills the emptied tank.   But not all gravity toilets work the same way. For instance, there are different   ways of ensuring that only 1.6-gal. of water is used in a single flush. A   few toilets use tank dams that fit around the flapper and allow only 1.6   gal. of water to flow into the bowl. Some toilets rely on an adjustable ballcock   to cut off the flow of water after 1.6-gal. has flowed. On others, the flapper   valve closes early. And still others include a plastic bucket type device   inside the tank that lets only the top 50% to 75% of water in the tank pass   through during a flush. That height increases the head pressure of the water   going into the bowl and results in a brisker flush.     However, most of these tanks hold more than 1.6-gal. of water, and most of   the ways manufacturers control the flow of water from tank to 'bowl are open   to adjustment. James Sargeant is a registered plumbing designer, master plumber   and director of the Wisconsin Plumbing Bureau. He's a member of the American   National Standards Institute (ANSI) Toilet Adjustability Committee and is   also in charge of codes and standards for the Kohler Company. ""Some plumbers   have the notion that when they get the toilet from the factory, they have   to adjust something, which wreaks havoc,"" according to Sargeant. ""What they're   adjusting is the water action. On a 1.6-gal. water closet, the bowl and trap   way are a finely tuned design system to go with a specific amount of water.   That's not just Kohler, that's all toilets. They're well-engineered bowls.""   Despite the best efforts of engineers, designers and manufacturers, plumbers   and the general public still haven't gotten used to 1.6-gal. toilets and   aren't happy with the way they flush.     What this country needs is plunger lessons      Complaints against the 1.6-gal. toilet include sluggish or incomplete flushing;   a small ""water spot,"" as the area of the toilet bowl water surface is called;   staining; and the need to double-flush or triple-flush. Critics say that   if a 1.6-gal. toilet is flushed more than twice, it uses more water than   the now illegal 3.5-gal. toilets.    ""In my opinion, it wouldn't be using more water if we went back to the 3.5-gal.   flush because my customers are flushing more than two or three times anyway,""   according to Seattle plumber  Hill Daughtry . ""Everybody with a lowflush   toilet has a plunger. The high-end houses have a decorative one, and the   low-end houses have a regular plunger.""     If you don't like the way 1.6-gal. gravity toilets flush, you can't necessarily   buy your way out of the problem. From plumbers around the country, I'm told   that high cost isn't a guarantee that a 1.6 Gal. gravity toilet will work   well. Often, higher cost is really associated with fancy design, casting   or color more than with the quality of function. According to Rex Cauldwell,   a plumber in Copper Hill, Virginia, ""The brands that work well have nothing   to do with the price of the commode. We're talking about some $75 toilets   that flush better than $250 toilets."" Daughtry agrees, sort of. ""With a   lot of highend toilets, you're paying for design. You can spend $1,400 or   buy a lower-end toilet that will do the same thing.     Although plumbers and the public complain about the way new toilets flush,   plumbing regulators say that the latest generation of l.6 gal. toilets works   just fine. What the public needs isn't more water but more education, they   say. We have to learn that toilets are only for No. 1 liquid waste, and No.   2, fecal waste.    These toilets are here to stay, so we'd better get used to them     Patrick Higgins is a licensed plumber and chairman of the ASME/ ANSI Plumbing Fixture   Committee. Higgins has a great deal of personal and professional experience   with 1.6-gal. toilets.     ""I've lived with l.6-gal. flushes for about eight years,"" according to Higgins.   ""Every six months, I retrofit a different style toilet off the shelf into   my office bathroom, and I've yet to run into one I don't like. Kohler, Briggs,   American Standard, Mansfield, Gerber. Someone's bringing a Toto by next week.   In my office bath now, I've got a combination water closet and bidet-that's   a Geberit and it works like a gem. I've looked at all of them. It's a matter   of getting used to the product and not using the toilet as a wastebasket.""   One reason that people still harbor ill feelings against 1.6-gal. toilets   is that the early models were not up to the duty. Although manufacturers   saw the new ultra-low-flush regulations coming, they were caught with their   pants down when the government finally acted. Some early l.6-gal. efforts   were lamentably short of the mark. Cauldwell said he once got a letter from   a major toilet manufacturer ""apologizing for the fact that their 1.6-gal.   toilet didn't work well but that they were required to make it. Sometimes   the problem is in the pipes. A number of plumbers warned me that installing   a 1.6-gal. gravity-flush toilet in an old house could lead to clogs and backups.   Often, older waste pipe is 4-in. or greater dia. cast iron, which is a lot   rougher on the inside than modern plastic pipe. When the cast-iron pipe was   installed, toilets flushed anywhere from 5 gal. to more than 7 gal, of water.   But now that they're down to 1.6-gal., that's often not enough water to power   the waste through.     ""Houses that have 4-in. to 6-in. cast-iron drains are a problem,"" said    Daughtry . ""When you put a 1.6-Gal.   toilet in with that diameter pipe, it just barely makes the bottom of the   pipe wet. As a retrofit in a house with old plumbing, it's lousy. Now I run   high-use fixtures, like the washing machine, just after the toilet. The washing   machine will help move that waste down the line."" Washington, D.C., plumber   Ken Goldman believes that retrofitting   l.6-gal. toilets is the biggest source of problems plumbers have with the   new fixtures. ""We're using plumbing fixtures that were designed for the 1990s   and putting them in plumbing systems that were designed for the 1920s,"" Goldman   said.     Power-assist toilets blast the waste away      If old pipes are your problem, you may be interested in the power-assist   toilets that many toilet makers now offer. These are toilets that use compressed   air to force the waste down the trap.    Although a few power-assist toilets require   compressors, most use the pressure of the home's water supply to get the   job done-with the help of a pressure tank. The Sloan Valve Company's   Flushmate Flushometer (800-533-3450)   is the industry leader in toilet pressure tanks. New on the market is the   PF/2 Energizer System (W/C Technology Corp.; 888-732-9282).     Both work similarly: Water from the supply line is forced into the air-filled   pressure tank at the house pressure of 60 psi or so, which compresses the   air and exerts force on the water in the tank. When the flush button is pushed,   the water jets into the bowl.     One benefit of a power-assist flush is that the water is contained inside   the pressure tank, which is inside the china toilet tank. That insulation   results in little or no tank sweating. Drawbacks include noise and price:   Power assist generally adds $ 100 or so to the cost of a toilet.    Water rushing from the pressurized tank can be quite loud and startling.   However, Bruce Martin, the engineer who developed both pressure-assist systems   (he sold the Flushmate technology to Sloan), said his new PF/2 Energizer   is much quieter than the Flushmate. ""It's as quiet as a gravity toilet,""   he said.     Currently, only about 5% of toilets sold contain any type of pressure tank.   Martin said the price of power-assist toilets will decrease, thanks in part   to competition and volume sales. For now, only specially designed toilets   can accept pressure-assist units. Martin is working on an adapter unit to   convert ordinary gravity toilets to pressure-assist.     A breakthrough in the engineering of gravity toilets      One of the more promising developments in gravity-flush toilet design is   the new vacuum-assist technology, which was developed by Fluidmaster and   is currently featured in the Vacuity toilet manufactured by Briggs Industries   (800-88&4458).     Although on the outside the Vacuity looks like any other toilet, it solves   several different problems that are common to many of the 1.6-gal. toilets.   First, it contains two plastic tanks within the toilet tank that hold only   1.6 gal, of water between them. If it's modified to flush more, it won't   flush, according to Oscar Dufau, Fluidmaster's product manager. The tanks   also prevent the exterior china tank from sweating in hot, humid weather.     More important, the system allows the toilet to give a complete, clean flush   using only the rim holes inside the upper toilet bowl. There is no siphon-jet   hole in this toilet. With all the water that is coming out of the rim holes,   the bowl stays cleaner.     The Vacuity is different from other gravity-flush toilets in another significant   way. The Vacuity has two internal tanks and is configured in such a way that   when you flush, a vacuum is created that powers the water into the bowl.     Although Briggs is the only U.S. toilet maker now using the Fluidmaster   vacuum-assist technology, other U.S. companies are developing toilet prototypes   that also use the technology. To keep the price of the unit at profitable   levels, however, Fluidmaster has agreed to allow only four U.S. makers to   license the technology.     Briggs lists its two-piece Vacuity toilet at near $300. However, I called   around southern Connecticut and found a supply house that could order one   for $217, plus $12 for the seat.     Special toilets for specific needs     Within the wide range of 1.6-gal. toilets on the market are some fairly specific   toilets and toilet accessories. These perform certain functions that you   won't find on a run-of-the-mill fixture.     For instance, there is the Shower/Toilet by Geberit (219-879-4466), a wall-hung   fixture that contains a wand to give you a warm-water nether shower. The   Geberit follows the shower with a flow of warm air. The Zoe Washlet by Toto   (800-9381541) is a high-tech toilet seat that contains a heating unit, a   fan, an air purifier and a wand that sprays warmed water on your undercarriage   (photo left, facing page). The Washlet also offers a pre warmed seat. And   both the Geberit and the Toto offer fans that extract toilet air and pass   it through a filter.     But that kind of luxury comes at a price. The Geberit Shower/Toilet, which   has the tank and flushing mechanism inside the wall, sells for $4,200 in   white. Color models cost much more. And the one-piece Prominence toilet by   Toto, including the Zoe Washlet with heated seat and a remote-control device   for controlling the spray, sells for about $1,200. Newer Toto toilets will   come with an antibacterial glazing, which the company says inhibits the growth   of germs and kills common types of bacteria.     Another specialized toilet option is the Peacekeeper by Kohler (800-456-4537).   There is no flush lever or button on toilets equipped with Kohler's Peacekeeper   technology. Instead, it automatically flushes when   the seat is closed, which makes it clear how it got its name. Here in   Connecticut, Kohler's Wellworth toilet with the Peacekeeper installed retails   for about $273 in white.     Kohler also makes the Eco Lite  , which replaces the standard single-flush lever with two levers.   Depressing the smaller one gives a .6-gal. flush. Depressing the larger   one gives a 1.6-gal. flush. The Eco Lite sells for about $186.     The Triangle Ultra by Eljer (972-407-2600) is a 1.5gal. toilet with a specially   designed triangular tank that can help to solve your bathroom-space problems.   With its 90"" angled tank, the Triangle Ultra can fit into an odd corner of   your bathroom. The Triangle lists for about $339 in blue. In white the price for the Triangle falls to $269.     A few companies make wall-mounted, rear discharge toilets. These toilets come in especially   handy during a renovation when there's   no practical way of installing a standard floor drain. The tank and flushing   mechanism for these toilets are concealed inside the wall. However, because   they are wall mounted, they require extra-beefy support inside the wall.     In our grandfathers' day, many toilet tanks were mounted high on the wall   above the bowl. Because of that height, the water came rushing down into   the bowl with enough pressure to force nearly anything down the drain. These   old fashioned toilets now use 1.6 gal, of water and are still available. Barclay   (847-244-1234) makes one in white that retails for about $850.     For those who feel at home on a throne, there's the English-made Nautilus   II, which is sold in this country by Burgess International   (313-292-7070). This is a real royal flush. A white Nautilus II sells for   $3,000; in black, the price increases to $4,500. The mold for this lion-shaped   commode is so complex that only 16 out of every 100 toilets survive the casting   process.     For extremely specific toilet requirements, Toto makes a toilet that analyzes   your urine, takes your blood pressure and then sends that information to   your doctor via a built-in modem. Unfortunately, you have to go to Japan   to buy one.     What else goes into toilets?      To see what goes into toilets (before what normally goes into toilets goes   into them), I visited several toilet plants. I saw a wide range of manufacturing   styles, from toilets made by hand in Wisconsin to an assembly-line plant   in Ohio to an automated toilet plant in Georgia.     Believe it or not, toilet making contains some highly guarded proprietary   secrets. Although I could observe any part of the process, I could photograph   only certain production areas. Secrets range from the brand of robot used   to spray glazing on the unfired toilet to the way the rim holes are punched   or drilled in the greenclay toilet bowl.     Each toilet starts with several molds, depending on the model. Each mold   is filled with slip,or liquid clay, and run through a dryer before being   glazed and kiln fired. Afterward, the tank components are installed.     As important as the manufacturing process is, however, it's the research   and engineering that go into the toilet and the final testing and quality   control after manufacturing that make a truly good toilet.     Residential toilets must pass a series of ASME/ANSI tests, including a test   in which 100 3/4-in. dia. plastic balls are flushed; a granule test in which   2,500 tiny plastic granules are flushed; a test in which ink lines are drawn   inside the upper rim and flushed away; a dye test; and a drain-line transport   test.    Every manufacturer tests toilets coming off the line. However, many manufacturers   have created their own tests in addition to the ASME/ANSI requirements. One   company that has its own set of standards is   Toto, the world's largest plumbing-products   manufacturer. At the Toto toilet factory   in Morrow, Georgia, an engineer tests toilets in a remarkably real way. He   doesn't actually defecate in them, but it's close. Using a proprietary ingredient   that closely resembles human feces, the engineer measures out up to 400g   of this faux waste and then molds it into its familiar tubular shape.     After plopping the artificial waste into the toilet, the engineer wads up   toilet-paper balls and drops them in on top of the bogus poop. Standing there   in the factory watching him do this, I felt like asking if he wanted to be   left alone. The purpose of this realism is to ensure that the toilets meet   or exceed ASME flush standards.     Which toilet should you buy?      According to Patrick Higgins, all toilets that pass the ASME standards tests   should work the same. In theory, I guess that's true. But we all know that   standards are only part of the story. The true test of whether a toilet-or   anything-works as it should occurs in the real world.     I can't definitively tell you which toilets work and which don't. All the   plumbers I talked to had wildly differing opinions about which is the best   gravity-flush toilet. There are a few other things to consider before spending   money on a new commode.     Thomas Pape, chairman of the Indoor Plumbing Committee for the American   Waterworks Association Conservation Committee, suggests that homeowners buy   rounded-bowl toilets instead of the elongated variety. ""These just seem to   work better than the elongated bowl,"" according to Pape. ""That's especially   true in a setting that might be abusive. You get a better vortex action out   of a round bowl.    A new feature of modern toilets is the advent of one-piece toilets, which   cost more than two piece toilets because they're harder to make. Otherwise,   there is no significant difference between one-piece and two-piece toilets.   They all flush the same way. In fact, some plumbers argue that the higher-tank   two-piece toilets actually flush better than the more expensive one piece   models because the water in the tank flows into the bowl from a greater height   and therefore has greater head pressure to accomplish a thorough flush.     Another thing that separates cheaper gravityflush toilets from the more expensive   ones is color. Color adds a lot to the price of a toilet. For instance, if   I'm willing to make do with a plain white Kohler Rosario one-piece toilet,   I can buy it at my local home-supply store for $296, plus the cost of a seat.   If I want it in gray, that price increases to $455.   American Standard's one-piece Ellise   toilet in white costs $720. Make it black, and it increases to $ 1,005.

A typical  toilet consists of a  bowl and tank, both of which are filled with water. The bowl serves as a receptacle for waste, and the tank holds the water used to flush the waste out of the bowl.    In addition, the water in the bowl helps to keep sewer gases from entering the house through the trap.       Water Pressure  Toilets like all plumbing fixtures and fixture fittings,  require water supplied in sufficient volume and at pressures adequate to enable them to function properly.    Most codes establish the minimum size of the water supply system and require a minimum of 15- to 20-psi flowing pressure at the toilet water supply inlet.    NOTE:  In areas where the water pressure is low,  it may be necessary to increase water supply sizes and/or incorporate a pressure booster system.  Be sure to consult with a plumbing contractor to  determine if the toilet you select will operate properly with the available pressure.     Rough-in requirements  The standard distance from the finished wall to the center line (point where the bowl connects to the floor) for most toilets is 12 inches.  However, depending on your plans, this distance may vary from 10 to 14 inches. You should know this dimension before you shop.      Most home centers carry toilets with 12-inch rough in; if you need something else you'll have to specify.  If you bring in your plans, our sales personnel can determine this for you.       Choosing a Toilet  Until recently, the decision on which toilet to purchase was based primarily on style, and with good reason. There wasn't much difference from one toilet to the next.    Toilets not only looked pretty much alike, but they all worked with the same functionality and quality,  and the mechanical design had not changed much since the 1800's.    That is still true of the basic builder-grade models, but technology has brought about vast improvements in the design of upgrade units.     Water Conservation   According to a recent  Water Conservation Study , the average person flushes the toilet 5 times a day.      Those 5 flushes per person may not seem like much until you realize that each person flushing an older 3.5 - 7 gallons per flush (gpf)  toilet,  uses  6,400-12,800 gallons/year.      As a water-conservation measure, the U.S. National Energy Policy Act of 1992 eliminated the standard 3.5 gallon flush and mandated a new standard of 1.6 gallons per flush (gpf)/6 liters per flush (lpf) maximum in all new toilets.    Since 1994, all toilets sold in the U.S. use 1.6 gallons per flush, or less. Replacing old toilets with newer models in your home will save up to $50 to $125 and up to 10,500 gallons each year, depending on utility rates and usage habits.       Early Problems  Consumers complained that with less water, toilets often clogged or failed to empty completely, forcing manufacturers  to redesign toilets with larger trapways, better waterflow designs, and even with pressure-assists.    Today's advanced models now flush as effectively as the older models, but using much less water.     Standard Efficiency Toilets - maximum of 1.6gpf/6.0-lpf  Using the new 1.6 gpf toilet, the same 5 flushes use 2,900 gallons per person,  But even with this reduction in water usage, standard-efficiency toilets are responsible for roughly  26% of all water used indoors.    High-Efficiency Toilets (HETs) - maximum of 1.3gpf/4.8-lpf  The new high-efficiency toilets use 1.28 gpf (or less) - an average of at least 20% less water  than a standard 1.6 gpf toilet.  That translates into  a total usage of 2,300 gallons/year per person. Although they use much less water, these toilets are very efficient.   Some new Pressure-Assist single-flush toilets use 1.1-gpf/4.0-lpf and below.    Note for High-Efficiency Toilets:    * Source: California Urban Water Conservation Council    HETs must meet the very same flushing performance and drain line waste transport requirements as all other toilets sold in the United States and Canada.    All toilets, regardless of flush volume, may experience problems when installed in locations with degraded or damaged drain line systems, e.g., root intrusion, sagging or broken lines, buildup of solids, etc., or in commercial buildings with very long drain line runs and no additional sources of wastewater near the toilet fixture.    However, when installed where these conditions exist, HETs, because of their reduced flush volume, could be slightly more susceptible to problems.     Dual Flush Toilets -  (0.8 - 1.1gpf / 1.6gpf - 3.0-4.0-lpf/6.0-lpf)  The newest of the high-efficient toilets are dual-flush, which allow you to select the amount of water that is used to flush the toilet.    A ""short flush""  (0.8 to 1.1-gpf/3.0 to 4.0-lpf)   is used to flush liquid wastes, and a ""full flush""  (1.6-gpf/6.0-lpf )   is used for solid wastes.        It's All in the Flush  All toilets are not created equal. Some home builders and budget-minded consumers looking to cut corners still install toilets that meet federal requirements, but don't always prevent clogs.    Toilet technology has greatly improved since the 1990's.  So much so, that today the first consideration in choosing a toilet should be the flushing mechanism.    Ask for a Demo  Generally speaking,  reading the manufacturer's  literature or talking with a sales person  isn't enough to make an informed decision about purchasing a toilet.  Consumers should ask to see a demonstration of a toilet's flushing power before they buy.    Demonstrations typically use items to simulate waste. Items used can include floating and sinking sponges, paper balls, golf balls, even toys!      Types of Available Toilets  Flush mechanisms currently on the market now:        Gravity Flush Tank  Toilets that have a water tank that works on the gravity principle. Water is released into the bowl and out through the S-shaped trapway, where a siphoning action pulls the waste out of the bowl.     Gravity Flush toilets are the most popular. Improved design has resulted in many good-performing models.      Washdown Toilets  Have large trapways and small waterspots. A large trapway means they are less likely to clog, but a small waterspot means they sometimes do not clean the bowl as well as other toilets.       Vacuum-Assist  Similar to gravity flush. Two plastic tanks within the toilet tank that hold only 1.6 gal. of water between them, and they are configured  in such a way that when the toilet is flushed, a vacuum is created that powers the water into the bowl to produce a more efficient flush.       Pressure-Assist  Uses  compressed air within the tank to propel water to the rim and siphon jet  creating a powerful ""push-through""  flush.  They tend to be louder and more expensive than gravity toilets, but have a reputation for good performance.        Electrohydraulic  Electrohydraulic toilets are the latest in hi-tech. Using electric motor(s), pumps(s), and controllers to assist the flushing action by monitoring and controlling the flush and dictating the exact discharge from the tank into the bowl.      Dual Flush  Dual-flush toilets have two buttons, one for solid waste, and one that flushes at less than 1.6 gpf for liquid waste. Some dual-flush toilets are washdown models.

The valve is designed so that when the toilet is flushed, the water supply is opened to create a pressurized discharge of water into the toilet.

The caption reads:    “ I love my Envirolet!!    Very nice words from  Envirolet Composting Toilet System  user…    “Hello!    I have been interested in owning a Envirolet Composting toilet since I was 17 and saw the ad in the back of Mother Earth News. I begged my mom but never succeeded in getting her to purchase one.    Finally at 27 I am a proud owner of my very own Envirolet. I live in a small camper trailor on an organic farm in Minnesota. I did not want to stink up my living quarters by using the toilet inside. I was surfing the net and found a website called “Twin Cities Free Market”, folks post stuff they do not want in hopes that someone will come and pick it up. Everything posted is free! A wonderful woman, posted an Envirolet and she chose me to be the new owner! She said she received 57 emails in response to her post.    She loved her envirolet but, was moving to Mexico and could not transport it with her.    I could not be happier with my new toilet. I put it behind the trailor and every morning put on my rubber boots and house coat and admire my surroundings while using the Envirolet. I installed a gravity water system next to it so, I have everything but a shower at my trailor.    Thanks for the wonderful design! I will have it until I move to Mexico!”    Sincerely,    Emily S.

The installation was not a typical one.  The toilet in the cottage was to be located about 50’ (15m) from the remote composting unit (housed in a shed).  This is farther than most installations, but the powerful vacuum flush proved itself.  The customer also wanted to be able to use the toilet system in the cold Canadian winter months so some extra insulation and heat cable was added to prevent freezing.

Training will be carried out by Nigel Lowthrop of Hill Holt Wood.

Envirolet VF Now Available in North America                    Envirolet launched a new composting toilet system called  Envirolet VF  at the Toronto  Cottage Life Show  last weekend.  The system has been in development since at least 2004 with research and testing being performed in Canada and Scandinavia.    Envirolet VF is a vacuum flush composting toilet system.  It is a joint effort from  Envirolet  (Sancor) and Dometic that combines a vacuum flush toilet and composting toilet system.  Envirolet Vf eliminates many installation difficulties faced when trying to install below grade.  In locations where previously only a waterless self-contained (all-in-one) type system would have worked, the VF can now be used because the powerful vacuum generator can flush up if needed.                          Other than eliminating some installation issues, Envirolet VF also offers a modern-looking toilet in the bathroom, electronic flushing controls and improved composting features.    This system may help propel compost toilets more into the mainstream with its sleek appearance and ease of installation.

EcoCamp Patagonia                    We like highlighting places that use composting toilets.   EcoCamp Patagonia  in Chile uses composting toilets.    “At the base of the Paine Massif lies the EcoCamp Patagonia, where nature-lovers are exposed to the elements while savoring lodging in geodesic domes that echo the wood, fur and skin huts that the regions ancient inhabitants once occupied. Passive heating and lighting, composting toilets, recycling, raised walkways and removal of the domes each winter ensures minimal impact on this fragile environment. Windowed roofs allow guests to fall asleep staring at the Southern Cross and awake to a blood-red sunrise that tints the four granite horns of Torres del Paine with a pinkish hue.”    Via  Deadwood Magazine .

If the experimental project is successful, the National Parks Board (NParks) may install dry toilets in their parks.    Mr Yeong Yee Shyong, assistant director of facilities for NParks, said: ‘We will consider using the dry toilet technology if it is shown to be effective in managing waste disposal in our parks and gardens, without compromising on cost and public hygiene.”    They made a compost toilet, nicknamed the Jack-a-Loo, to see how the technology works for them.

The article smartly points out that “28% of all home water is flushed down your toilet.”    All the more reason to switch to a composting toilet to save valuable fresh water at your home, cottage, cabin, etc.    Go to  wish.ca  to learn more about Wish magazine.

Extra Warranty Protection                    The warranty coverage on the Internal Components of  Envirolet® Composting Toilet Systems  has increased from an already industry leading 4-years to  5-years .  There is already a Lifetime Warranty on the system body.    This covers electrical components (fans, heater, thermostats, wiring, etc.) plus all other internal parts like rakes, hardware, etc.    The new warranty was just introduced, but customers who purchased their system in 2005 can upgrade to 5-years from 4 for a small fee.    You can read more about it in the  EnviroletCare™  section of their web site.                                                                                     Composting Toilets are the Answer!                    Composting toilets would solve a costly sewage issue in Montana!    Unforntunately, the solution  they are looking into too are not composting toilet systems  and is very expensive.                                                                                     Envirolet Waterless Remote Tank Installed in Composting Outhouse                                        While we’re showing some installations, here is another.  This Envirolet Waterless Remote System is installed in a “composting outhouse.”  Looks great.    Ted writes, “Hello, I built an outhouse for a customer.  It is all cedar and is the best looking outhouse I have ever seen.  I installed one of your units in it, and it is working great.  if you want to see pictures of it, or if any of your clients want to see a real life working  model I have a web page with pictures.”    See more photos at  www.bayfieldbuilders.com                                                                                     Envirolet Low Water Remote System in Canada, Part 2                                        Here is the other photo referred to in the last post.

[This one’s for a little fun for my readers] What do you think of compost toilets such as Envirolets,  www.envirolet.com ? Do you have one and would you push for this to replace American Standards in every Canadian home? I mean, they are made in Canada afterall.    I don’t have one of these toilets, but it looks like a good idea. I do have a low flush (6 litres per flush) toilet that has reduced our water use. I would think that the envirolet may be suitable in some sites, but I don’t know if it would work in a condo. I’ll have to read up on it.    [Via  The Voice of the Greens in Burnaby-New Westminster  from an interview by  Samantha Burns .]                                                                                      Composting Toilet Certification Claims                    We thought we would discuss briefly the topic of certifications and composting toilets in order to clarify a few things.  We have received emails regarding some possibly confusing issues and hope to dispel any myths.    Questions about NSF® Standard-41  NSF® Standard-41 is a common standard looked for by many local and state authorities in the United States.  This is a composting toilet system performance standard.    On the web, you may find that some composting toilet companies claim that  only  NSF® can test to an NSF® standard, such as NSF® Standard-41.    Is this true?  Can only NSF® test to NSF® Standard-41?  No, this is not true. Although  NSF®  (National Sanitation Foundation) created Standard-41, other Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTL) can test to the same standard.  Among other reasons, this allows for fair competition by allowing companies to get local testing agencies to test their products.    Any company that tells you or advertises this is either incorrect and/or misleading you.    For example,  Envirolet® Composting Toilet Systems  were tested and are certified to meet  NSF® Standard-41  and  ANSI/NSF-41 1998  by CSA®, the Canadian Standards Association.    CSA® tests and certifies products to a wide range of regional, national and international standards, including standards written or administered by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Canadian Standards Association (CSA), National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and others.  [Via  CSA® .]    If you have any concerns or questions about this, please contact  CSA®  on the web or by calling 1-866-797-4272.    What about claims of being the only certified or listed product?  A product certified to an NSF® standard by another agency (e.g., CSA®, UL®) will not appear on the NSF® web site.  But, will appear on the actual testing agency web site and/or a copy of the certification will be available from them upon request.    What about claims of being the first certified or listed product?  Again, this may be true.  But, in reality, this is irrelevant.  The first microwave oven certified many many years ago to a standard is not necessarily better than one certified last week.

Concerned Resident Wants Composting Toilets to be Considered                    A concerned Citrus County, Florida resident is trying to  push the use of composting toilets .  Unforntunately, she is getting resistence despite the obvious environmental and cost benefits.    A lot of the resistance is due to a true understanding of composting toilets and how they work.

Don't despair. Follow this advice for maximizing a minimal space.     Bamboo shades and a sisal rug add contemporary touches to Sheila's clean-lined country cottage. Small space dos  Homeowner Sheila York knows you don't have to live in a palace-size place to reap the benefits of good design. In fact, smart space-stretching ideas abound in her 1,200-square-foot Michigan home, from room-expanding paint treatments to efficient ways for displaying treasures. Here, she shares her design dos and don'ts for other homeowners who have more style than space.     Vertical molding creates the illusion of more volume in the dining room. DO Start at the ceiling.  Sheila hung the window treatments in the dining room from the highest possible point on the wall (just under the crown molding). Hanging the curtains high lets the fabric flow freely and tugs the eye upward.                    Well-chosen furniture, including a large ottoman that doubles as a table, makes a smaller home cozy and efficient. DO Include built-ins.  They take up almost no floor space but yield plenty of much-needed storage -- both perfect characteristics for a small house. Sheila assigned double duties to a built-in bookcase in the living room: It not only holds books and display items but also serves as a mini-bar.  DO Reflect on the situation.  Mirrors and panes of glass act as room expanders when strategically placed to reflect something pretty. The small mirror next to the built-in bookcase in Sheila's living room doubles the number of pretty glasses in view. And she made the dining room lustrous by adding glaze to yellow paint so the walls reflect the limited light.       A large hutch commands the spotlight in the dining room. DO Open rooms to each other.  Though it's important to clearly define separate spaces, some openness between adjoining rooms makes all of them feel bigger. Sheila's cramped kitchen used to be cut off completely from the dining room, but now a large pass-through connects the two spaces. In a similar way, her office joins the living room through a French door, which allows the two rooms to share the same light and views.     Slate blue paint defines the dining room; other rooms have plain hardwood floors.. DO Define different spaces subtly.  Separate one room from another without choosing completely different wall colors or flooring. A checkerboard pattern in slate blue on the floor of the dining room looks like an area rug without being bulky.     DO Give each room its own treatment.  To differentiate it from the living room, Sheila rag-rolled the walls of the dining room; the living room walls are covered in yellow striated wallpaper. Although the tones are similar (and therefore unifying), the texture in each space is unique.      A simple upholstered cornice dresses the kitchen window; its stripes are echoed on the walls and ceiling. DO Opt for light colors.  One law of color is that pale tones advance, thus expanding a room, while dark colors recede and shrink a space. Sheila's kitchen gets a lift from airy white cabinets; her bedroom glows with walls covered in white linen.  DO Draw the eye upward.  This creates the illusion of more volume, which makes up for a lack of square footage. Crown molding, painted crisp white, defines the ceiling in Sheila's living room; striped wallpaper also stretches the height of the walls in the kitchen. The dining room walls boast a special treatment: A chair rail, set about two-thirds of the way up the wall, caps pieces of trim that run vertically to the floor.     DO Keep flooring continuous.  Maintaining the same flooring material throughout the house imparts a sense of continuity; the eye does not jump from one room to the next but rather wanders easily between the spaces. Sheila's hardwood floors are light-stained to look even more expansive.      Large windows let lots of light in and help visually enlarge the room.   DO Invite the sunshine inside.  Large windows usher in sunlight to bounce off the walls and brighten even the dreariest room. In an area that requires privacy, such as a bath or bedroom, put up window treatments that can be adjusted easily to let the sun pour in. Light from the windows in Sheila's master bedroom, for instance, is dappled by hinged shutters. Sheila can leave them closed to stave off the sun's hot rays, leave one ajar for a little extra dribble of light, or open all of them for sheets of sunshine.       Take advantage of outdoor space to stretch your living areas.   DO Stretch your space into the outdoors.  A patio, deck, or screen porch, such as Sheila's, goes a long way toward increasing usable space -- without the expense of adding on. Sheila's porch provides all the comforts of an interior room, including screens to keep the bugs at bay, an awning to protect against harsh sun, and cozy, welcoming furnishings that invite lounging. ""It's my favorite room in the house,"" she says.       Though not original to the 1920s-era house,the porch is Sheila's favorite room.   Small space don'ts DON'T Be afraid of large-scale furniture.  Sheila recommends using a few dramatic pieces, such as the large, painted, country-style hutches in her living and dining rooms. They add necessary storage and serve as focal points to keep each room from feeling too ""wimpy,"" she says.   DON'T Clutter up the house.  ""Sometimes, less really is more,"" Sheila says. ""I don't like my rooms to be crowded, and pieces that work hard are especially important in a small space. When you think you have pared down enough, eliminate more.""        Sheila York (with cat Long Tail) sits out on the porch asoften aspossible.   DON'T Overwhelm with a lot of patterns.  ""I like my home to be peaceful and serene, so I chose a quiet palette,"" Sheila says. ""If it weren't for my cat, who likes to lie on the furniture, I'd have all white upholstery. Sage green is the next best thing.""   DON'T Forget the ceiling.  It's a room's fifth wall. Gain volume by treating the ceiling the same way as the walls; Sheila continued the rag-rolled yellow paint onto the ceiling of her dining room.   DON'T Leave out architectural detailing.  Not reserved for only ornate areas, accents such as molding and wainscoting are simple ways to define and dress up a small space. In Sheila's living room, deep crown molding was the inspiration for the color of the just-as-crisp-looking ceiling.   DON'T Buy furniture just to buy furniture.  Figure out how much seating you need for the number of people in your household and the number you typically entertain, and buy enough furniture to suit that amount. Otherwise, you end up with a cramped space that's not comfortable.   DON'T MESS with fussy window treatments.  Fabric that overwhelms with pattern will draw attention to itself and away from a carefully thought-out room design. Choose simple treatments that filter the sun and provide privacy from the neighbors while blending with your furnishings.        A small pond and simple wooden bench add focal points to the small yet inviting backyard.   DON'T Waste an inch of space.  Even the closets should work hard. Sheila recommends installing extra closet shelving for storing shoes and other necessities. She also weeds through her possessions every now and again to keep clutter to a minimum.   DON'T Feel limited by a small yard.  Sheila's yard offers seating, plants, and a small pond she built with advice from a local home center.               Copyright by Meredith Corporation.

Installing a new toilet is actually a rather simple plumbing procedure that can be accomplished in just a few steps. To install the new toilet, you'll need a new toilet gasket and two 5/16-inch bolts to mount the bowl to the floor flange, but most of the required parts will be included with the new toilet.   When removing the old toilet, shut off the water supply to the tank and flush the toilet. Use a bucket or cloth to remove any leftover water in the tank and bowl. Using a pair of pliers or small pipe wrench, remove the nut connecting the water line to the ballcock valve at the bottom, left side of the tank.                 Use a small crescent wrench to remove the two nuts that hold the bowl to the floor flange. Once the nuts are removed, lift and remove the old toilet.    Click screen to play a tutorial video on installing a toilet:                             1.  The exposed flange is the mounting base for your new toilet. Discard the old bolts.       2.  First, place the two new, 5/16-inch bolts in the holes located on the sides of the exposed flange, with the bolt heads inside the flange. Position the bolts straight up and across from each other. Then put the new toilet gasket (wax ring) on the flange, with the flat side pointing up, if tapered.        3.  Lower the new bowl straight down, centering it on the wax ring and making sure both bolts come though the holes on each side of the bowl. Apply pressure straight down, pushing the bowl over the ring and flange, squeezing the wax to create a seal and mounting the bowl flush with the floor.        4.  Add washers and nuts to the protruding bolts and tighten until snug. (Over-tightening can crack the bowl).       5.  To install the toilet's tank, push two 5/16-by-3-inch mounting bolts through the small holes on the tank's bottom. Place rubber washers just beneath the bolt heads inside the tank to create a watertight seal. Add nuts and washers to the bolts on the underside of the tank and tighten until snug.       6.  Apply the sponge-rubber gasket (with small side down if beveled) over the discharge tube where the tank sets on the bowl.        7.  Set the tank on the bowl, threading the bolts into the bolt-holes on the bowl and sandwiching the gasket between the tank and bowl.       8.  Add metal washers and nuts to the bolts where they extend downward from the bottom of the bowl. Hold the tank level and tighten. It may help to hold each bolt stationary with a screwdriver inside the tank while backing up the nut with a crescent wrench on the outside of the bowl.        9.  Install a new toilet-flush handle by screwing the handle to the lift arm, through the handle hole in the tank. Toilet handles are threaded in reverse. Connect the lift arm to the chain of the flushing ball/flapper inside the tank.       10.  Bolt the new toilet lid to the bowl.        11.  Install a new water line from the wall or floor fixture to the feed valve on the underside of the tank. Turn on the water and check for leaks. Give it a couple of trial flushes. If your toilet holds water, tighten the bolts that hold the bowl to the floor. If there's any instability between the tank and bowl, or bowl and floor, use hard rubber shims, usually available at hardware stores, to adjust minor spacing problems and ensure a smooth ride.     12.  Once everything is in place and adjusted, cut the ends off the bowl-mounting bolts to accommodate the plastic bolt caps.  You may want to caulk the base of the bowl to create a waterproof seal, protecting the floor and providing additional stability.   Put on the tank cover, and your new toilet is ready for its maiden voyage.

By using a duel flush toilet you determine the water amount your toilet will use each time that it flushes. With a duel flush toilet you select which flushing option to take when you use the toilet. Basically a duel flush toilet will use either 1.6 gallons of water or .8 gallons every flush. It is not difficult to see how much water a duel flush toilet can save, especially when thinking in terms over the entire year. This is because it drastically cuts the amount of water you will use in 80% of the flushes. Basically if your home has one or several duel flush toilets you are helping the environment by saving water and you will be saving money on your water bill. Here are some tips you should know when installing a duel flush toilet. ∗  You should be aware is basically the same as picking out a general toilet. There are duel flush toilets that are available in various styles and colors. There are also various price rangers for duel flush toilets. Duel flush toilets look exactly the same as other toilets except for the mechanism that is, many times, two separate buttons you will use in order to select the volume of water used when you flush the toilet. ∗  You should know that there has been concern about low flush toilets and their ability to work. This concern has been addressed by the plumbing fixture industry. Duel flush toilets work better or the same than some of the older design of toilets. Here are some steps to take when installing a duel flush toilet. ∗  By installing a duel flush toilet it requires a new toilet bowl as well as a tank. The newer type toilet bowls that are especially designed to work with water volumes that are lower are needed in order for the toilet to work correctly. ∗  Low flush toilets and duel flush toilets are a little different in size that regular toilet models. This should be considered when you replace your toilet if the wall that is behind the toilet is not completed. ∗  You will use the existing plumbing for the new duel flush toilet. The new duel flush toilets are readily available to work with a 1 inch rough-in and 10 and 14 inch rough-ins. In excess of 90% of toilet instillations will have a 12-inch rough in. ∗  Installing a duel flush toilet is only a matter of turning off the water to the toilet you already have in your bathroom. You undo the plumbing bolts that hold the toilet to the floor and then set in the new duel flush toilet. The entire job of installing a duel flush toilet is not very difficult and should take more than a few hours.

Toilets are available in a variety of styles and colors, and in a wide price range.  Most homeowners will install basic units in guest baths and in children's bathrooms, but will upgrade for the powder room that will be used by company, and will go all out for their master bath.      Be aware,  not all options or features are available in all types of toilets.  Your choices may be limited by the  type of flush system your toilet uses.  Newer technologies, because they are newer, offer a more limited range of styles, colors and options. Gravity type toilets offer the most flexibility in style.       ROUND or Elongated     Toilets come in round-front and elongated sizes, with many different shapes and styles to choose from.    Round-front toilets are 2"" shorter than elongated models,  and are popular where space is at a premium or where a more traditional look is preferred.    Elongated toilets are the best choice for most homes.  The extra space in the front makes it easier for males to use.    The style you select is a matter of personal taste, and you can choose from a variety of styles, ranging from contemporary to traditional.         WALL  MOUNT  Wall-mount toilets are fastened to the wall, do not have a pedestal or tank, and can be set at almost any height. Since the toilet itself is mounted to the wall, rather the floor, bathroom cleanup a breeze. Since the toilet itself is mounted to the wall, rather the floor, bathroom cleanup a breeze.     While they can be used in almost any type of decor, they are most often used in a contemporary or Euro-style setting.        Most residential tankless toilets are actually stylish wall-mount toilets with the tank hidden within the wall itself.  These units provide a sleek, clean look without resorting to smaller fixtures or sacrificing design options.    Since the toilet tank (cistern) is built into the wall, an additional 6"" to 9"" of floor space can be gained (depending on the bowl shaped selected).    The flush actuator is generally mounted above the bowl but some manufacturers, such as Geberit, offer a remote unit that can be placed on the wall within 6' of the tank.     Concealed toilet tanks have been used in Europe for almost 40 years.  The high density polyethylene tank (shown at the right)  is insulated and installed between the wall studs, and has a quieter flush than floor-mounted models.    Geberit's Tessera TM  toilet system (shown at the left) brings high style and a sleek design to the American bathroom. Available with a small remote flush actuator or a flush actuator panel, Tessera offers a variety of convenience features making the system both unique and efficient.     Learn More  »         FLOOR MOUNT  Standard toilets mount to the floor and  have a short pedestal base below the bowl.  They adapt well to almost any type of decor.     There are lots of choices in floor mount toilets:  round or elongated bowl,  one or two piece, and what height the toilet should be.. Beyond that you will have a choice of colors and ornamental trim, and several style options. Always sit down on a toilet before buying it to make sure the height and size are comfortable.    HEIGHT  Toilets come in a variety of heights from 10"" to 18"" (measured from the bottom to the top of the rim, not including the seat).    The  standard toilet  is 14 1/2"" - 15"" high, which most people find too low to be comfortable.       In order to meet the standards of the Americans With Disabilities Act, toilets should have a height of either 16 1/2 inches (used in residential construction) or 18 inches (used in commercial construction).          This is comparable to the height of an average household chair making it easier to sit down without falling, and stand up without putting stress on the knees.    While these units were designed to allow easier access to the facility for disabled people, those without disabilities often prefer them to traditional units.       The 16.5"" height is becoming increasingly popular for use in the Master Bath, but should definitely be considered a standard for use in the Guest Powder Room. These higher toilets are available in most models on the market, including one-piece toilets.     Toilet manufacturers are marketing the higher toilets under a variety of names.   Kohler's Comfort Height.™(shown left)is one example     Please note, taller units are not always comfortable for shorter people or for children however.       ONE or TWO- PIECE  Most toilets are two-piece, having a separate tank and bowl.  They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, colors and even patterns.       Gravity flush one-piece toilets, have the tank molded to the bowl,  and they are generally considered more stylish than traditional two-piece toilets. They are also more expensive.      One-piece construction prevents leaks between the bowl and tank.  Noise levels are also lower than traditional toilets.     New flush technologies that use a pump instead of a water tank, have not only created a true tankless toilet, but have allowed manufacturers to actually rethink the shape of the toilet.    For instance, Kohler's award winning, comfort height   Purist® Hatbox™  electric toilet (shown at left) offers a perfect example of melding stark beauty with outstanding function.    This  innovative toilet may indeed lay the groundwork for the next generation of toilet.        COLOR/PATTERN:  Toilets come in more colors than just white, but most people prefer white because they consider it the easiest to decorate around and less likely to go out of style.    Manufacturers offer toilets in range of colors from white to black.  Although most color choices are in the lighter, neutral, end of the spectrum. The actual number of available colors varies by manufacturer.         If you want color, but think the pastel shades are too ""quiet"" and black a bit daunting, consider one of the new Artist Edition, hand-painted fixtures from Kohler.    ( English Trellis  pattern shown)    Many of the Artist Edition patterns include sink/vessel  bowls, pedestal lavatories, toilets, bidets, coordinating ceramic faucet trim, tile and accessories to complete the picture perfect setting.          SPECIAL FUNCTIONS    Do you see what is missing in this picture?    There is no flush handle!  The only way to flush this toilet is to lower the seat.    Kohler's innovative  Peacekeeper™ seat-actuated flush  solves the age-old dispute about leaving the toilet seat up, because it flushes when the user closes the lid.      A sensor in the tank automatically flushes the toilet when the lid is closed.  And because the sensor is in the tank, any toilet seat can be used.    Available on a select line of Kohler toilet tanks - the sensor requires two D-size, 1.5 volt Alkaline  batteries)         NO-SWEAT TANKS  In humid climates, warm room air can condense on the cooler surfaces of a toilet and drip onto the floor, which can encourage mildew, and can rot subflooring.    Kohler offers a factory-installed foam lining option which minimizes condensation on the outside of a toilet tank by insulating the cold water in the tank from hot, humid air.       UNIQUE DESIGNS/STYLES     Sometimes function alone isn't enough.    If you're looking for something truly unique,  and price is of little concern, there are many options available that are not usually stocked at mass merchandisers.    If the Victorian era is your style, a  classic pull-chain, gravity toilet from  Sunrise Specialty  lends authenticity along with a water saving 1.6-gpf for your contemporary lifestyle.     OLD WORLD ELEGANCE  For a truly one-of-a-kind bathroom, consider having a toilet and/or other fixture,  decorated and bronzed.

A 1in (2.5 cm) gap between the toilet and the wall is required.           Available in a limited palette of KOHLER colors,  List price begins at $977.80           ADVANCED  DESIGNS  Bathroom fixtures are changing radically as technology advances and consumer demands expand.      In Japan, models are being shown that purify the wastewater for reuse.  In China, a ""compost toilet"" is being sold that uses no water.  These units are highly useful in areas where drinking water is in short supply.      Vitra has begun using a new anti-bacterial glaze in its commercial plumbing fixtures.  Called  VitraHygiene , the new glaze is created by adding silver ions to the raw glaze before firing. The silver particles are able to reduce bacterial growth because the bacteria can't breathe or breed.     Vitra's  Vitraclean  is a unique surface is so incredibly smooth that water is repelled. Dirt simply runs off along with the water and the build up of lime scale is reduced to provide longer lasting cleanliness and better hygiene. It is currently offered only on commercial fixtures.     Researchers in Vienna have begun production on what they call a ""toilet with brains,"" which is a high tech model with adjustable hand rails designed to assist disabled or elderly people.    Other advanced designs  will do everything from automatically flush after use, raise and lower the seat automatically, and even analyze urine while taking the user's blood pressure.    Form almost always follows function.  As new technological developments are introduced into the marketplace, new designs, styles and shapes will follow.      MATERIALS:  Toilets are predominately made of vitreous china, which is clay fired at high temperature to form a high gloss, stain-resistant surface.     They are durable but can be chipped, cracked, or broken if abused. Under normal use, however, they can last a lifetime. Some commercial units, particularly those used in prisons and in some public buildings, are made of stainless steel, but these seldom found in the home.    Maintenance  Toilets are easily cleaned with commercial toilet bowl cleaners and a common toilet brush.    Often bleach alone will eliminate hard water stains. Any mild bathroom cleaner can be used on exterior surfaces and the seat.  Avoid placing your hands in contact with toilet bowl cleaners.  Wear  rubber gloves for safety purposes. You should never pour boiling water into a toilet because china can crack, and since they are fragile they can be broken by impact from heavy objects.    Be sure to clean under the rim each time you clean the bowl.  Lime deposits can overtime clog the rim holes,  reducing not only  the amount of water flowing through these holes, but the flushing action as well.             NEVER MIX CLEANING PRODUCTS OF ANY KIND    The combination of chemicals can prove to be volatile, flammable and utterly dangerous for you everyone in your home.         NEVER MIX CHLORINE BLEACH WITH OTHER PRODUCTS  Household bleach mixed with an ammonia-based cleaner or acid type cleaner, such as lime scale remover, produces deadly  chlorine gas or hormone gas.     Chlorine Bleach  +  Ammonia/Acid  =  Chlorine Gas    Many household cleaners contain chlorine, though it is often called something else, such as ""sodium hypochlorite"" or ""hypochlorite"", among other names.    Limescale removers and other toilet cleaners contain acid.  Vinegar and citrus based products are acidic.    Many glass, tub and tile cleaners contain ammonia.     Chlorine Bleach  +  Ammonia/Acid  =  Chlorine Gas     Brief exposure can produce:        Dizziness, Coughing, Tightness in the chest, Shortness of breath         Asthma, Burning in the throat and eyes, Serious lung irritation.        For mild exposure, get outside if possible.  Get plenty of fresh air.  Use oxygen or  a bronchodialtor if necessary.  Effects generally resolve in a few hours.       Prolonged exposure can produce:       Serious burns to the skin, eyes, lungs and death       Seek medical attention at once.                 1     2                   See Also:    Toilets - Know before you buy   Dual Flush Toilets - Know Before You Buy   High Efficient Toilets (HETs) - Know before you buy   Beyond the Flush - All about style       Bathroom Design Ideas   Green Bath Design        View the  current list of all WaterSense™ approved products .

You only need four tools to get the job done right: a small wrench, a socket set, a flat-head screwdriver, and a level. You might also need a scraper and an old towel.   In a pinch, you can use two adjustable wrenches in place of the small wrench and socket set, although using the right tools to do the job will make the job much easier to complete... I started to say ""crescent(r) wrenches"" until I realized that Crescent(r) is actually a brand of adjustable wrenches and other tools, owned by Cooper Hand Tools, a division of Cooper Industries, Inc. Here is a clear case of the brand name becoming universally utilized as a generic product description.       Parts Necessary For Your Toilet Installation   You will need to get the toilet bowl, toilet tank, toilet flange bolts, and we recommend a kitchen/bath silicone caulk. If you have uneven floors or tile floors, you might also need some rubber shims. Since the wax bowl ring only costs a couple of bucks, I would recommend that you replace it too. You should get the one with the plastic flange attached to it.       Pulling Up Your Old Toilet   The first thing you want to do when you are pulling your old toilet up is to cut off the water supply. In most cases, you will be able to do that from a water shut-off valve at the floor level below your toilet. Once you have closed off the water supply, then you will want to loosen the water supply line where it enters the base of your toilet tank.   You will be able to flush out most of the water in your toilet tank and basin, but you will never get all of the water out. So, it is good practice to have an old towel lying around to soak up the small amount of water that will spill when you take out your old toilet.   You will want to detach your toilet seat and toilet lid before you haul your old toilet out of the house. That is done by loosening the nuts directly below the hinge on your seat, from below the porcelain of the toilet.   At the floor level, you will see two plastic caps that will need to be removed so that you can get to the nuts below. Once you have removed these nuts, your toilet should come straight up.       Preparing The Area For Your New Toilet   When you pull up the old toilet, you will find a wax bowl ring on the floor.   This is the only part of the task that can get messy. When you pull up the wax ring, you might have some of the wax stuck to the floor. You will need to scrape up this old wax. Your old towel comes in handy here as well, since you can use it to clean the wax from your scraper, so you don't have to get the wax on your hands.   If you are putting new toilet flange bolts in, now is the time to do that. The heads of the bolts have two flat sides and two rounded sides. Turn them sideways to get them into the flange, and then turn them where the cornered sides are under the lip of the flange. With your new flange bolts set, there will be a plastic piece with a cross cut from the middle. You should slide this over the bolt and push is towards the floor. This will keep your flange bolts from sliding out of position.       Prepare Your Toilet Bowl For Placement   Take your toilet bowl out of the box, and place it upside down on the floor.   At this point, you should put the level on the floor to make sure that you are dealing with a level surface. If you are not dealing with a level surface, you will need to use the rubber shims to stabilize your toilet once it is put it in place. You can use masking tape to fasten the rubber shims to the base circumference of your toilet.   If you have a tile floor, you will want to use the rubber shims to keep your toilet from moving or swiveling after you have set it in place. Any movement of the toilet bowl after you have set it in place might break the seal of your wax ring. If your seal is broken, you will run the risk of having sewer gas leak back into your bathroom, or you will find that your toilet leaks unclean water onto your floor.   Once you have applied the shims to the bottom of your toilet, you will want to place the wax bowl ring on the base of your toilet. The plastic part that drops below the wax is supposed to go into the hole in your floor that leads to the sewage drain, so apply it to the base of your toilet bowl facing away from the toilet.   The last step you will want to take before affixing the toilet bowl to the floor is to put some kind of marker down to show you where the toilet flange bolts are located. The last thing you want to be doing is to be hovering the toilet above the floor wondering where the bolts are so that you can drop the toilet in the right spot the first time. Whether you put a couple screwdrivers on the floor pointing to the flange bolts or put a pencil mark on the floor is up to you, so long as you leave yourself a way to make a visual alignment from above the toilet.       Executing Your Bowl Plan   Once you get through this next step, it is all down hill from here. It is now time to flip your toilet bowl over and then to slowly guide it onto the toilet flange bolts.   If you put good markers on the floor to remind you where the bolts are located, you should be able to put the holes over the bolts on your very first try. From personal experience, I can tell you that not marking off where your bolts are located will lead to many headaches.   Once you have your toilet bowl on the floor, gently press it to the floor. Sitting on your new toilet is often a good choice. If you sense a wobble in your toilet, you may need to affix additional rubber shims to level your toilet. You do not want to lift the toilet back off the floor unless you have another wax bowl ring handy. I also learned that from the school of hard knocks.   At this point, you will want to put the plastic piece with the square hole onto your bolt on top of the porcelain, then put the washer on, and finally start your nuts on the bolts.   As you put on the nuts, twist them down to just above the porcelain, and then turn each just a few turns before going to the other side. The point is that each side needs to be tightened just a little bit at a time. This is important because you do not want to over-tighten the nuts causing the flange or porcelain to break.       Attaching The Toilet Tank   In most cases, there will be a rubber gasket attached to the bottom of the tank. Just slip the tank onto the top of the toilet bowl, lining up the three holes on the tank with the three holes on the bowl.   If the tank did not have a rubber gasket on the bottom of it that also surrounded the boltholes, the tank will come with rubber gaskets to be affixed to your bolts before sliding them into the holes from inside the toilet tank. Just slide the bolts into the holes from the top.   Put your level on top of the tank to help you guide the tightness of your nuts. You will want to make sure that when you are done, your toilet tank is level.   Put the washers on the bottom side of the bolts, and then start the nuts on your bolts. Once again, you will want to tighten each of the three nuts a little bit at a time, so that you do not break the bowl or the tank. Use your flat head screwdriver to hold the bolt in place as you tighten the nuts.       Final Steps...   We only have three easy steps remaining. First, you need to reattach the water supply to the fitting on the bottom of the tank. Do turn on the water to make sure that you do not have any leaks.   Next, put a bead of your kitchen/bathroom silicone caulk around the front and sides of your toilet. You want to leave the back open in the event that the wax seal breaks at some point. Leaving that area open will allow you to notice a problem, before damage is done to the floor under the toilet.   And finally, you will want to put your toilet seat back on your toilet.       Ready For Use   You are now ready to use your new toilet. Most people can complete this job in just under an hour.       About The Author:    Cecil Radmore writes about home improvement.

RV solar panels therefore come as one of the most advantageous and newest inventions in the field, allowing one to enjoy a high level of comfort in a very ecological and efficient way. Depending on the type of camping and the size of the vehicle, solar panels are available in a variety of sizes though they also offer the extension possibility too. Let's see some details of the way RV solar panels are designed to function. The RV solar panels store the sun energy in a battery, and this electricity will then be used in the DC power form. There are two usage options here: the solar panels can send the energy to a storage battery charger or directly to the amenities you want to operate. The former possibility is preferable since it makes the most comfortable and efficient way to have energy available all the time. Do not buy RV solar panels unless they come with clear directions for the proper mounting, wiring and the like. The investment in such recreational vehicle devices is not very high, and the benefits are surely infinite. The traditional and less advisable alternative to the RV solar panels is the use of a mechanic generator running on hydrocarbons. The problem with such devices is that they emit exhaust fumes and they are highly noise. With the RV solar panels there is absolutely no buzzing in the background, as the energy-generating systems are completely silent. One other advantage is the absence of organic fuel; oil, gas and the like are pretty difficult to transport and their burning is not at all safe for your family.                               At the end of the holiday, the RV solar panels should not be left mounted on the vehicle. Their removal is very easy, particularly since most of them can be folded, not to mention that they are lightweight too. Moreover, storage is not a problem, since any clean and dry place will do with the only precaution that you avoid the panels getting in contact with moisture. Last but not least, do not compare the prices for petrochemical generators with those of RV solar panels, apparently, the former are the cheaper, but when it comes to usage efficiency the latter are unbeatable.                                    © copyright 2008 yourdomain.com.

Here are        some simple rules for keeping your closets neat and clean:                             Use it or lose it! Remove all clothing you haven't worn in the last 6          months to a year. Put it in bags for charity donation.                         Separate everyday clothing from special occasion clothing.                         Place seasonal items in under-the-bed bins. Mark these with your          LetraTag Label Printer so you know what's inside.                         Organize clothing by color.                         Make subsets of your clothing by organizing them by similar items.

Installing a new toilet is actually a rather simple plumbing procedure that can be accomplished in just a few steps. To install the new toilet, you'll need a new toilet gasket and two 5/16-inch bolts to mount the bowl to the floor flange, but most of the required parts will be included with the new toilet.   When removing the old toilet, shut off the water supply to the tank and flush the toilet. Use a bucket or cloth to remove any leftover water in the tank and bowl. Using a pair of pliers or small pipe wrench, remove the nut connecting the water line to the ballcock valve at the bottom, left side of the tank.                 Use a small crescent wrench to remove the two nuts that hold the bowl to the floor flange. Once the nuts are removed, lift and remove the old toilet.    Click screen to play a tutorial video on installing a toilet:                             1.  The exposed flange is the mounting base for your new toilet. Discard the old bolts.       2.  First, place the two new, 5/16-inch bolts in the holes located on the sides of the exposed flange, with the bolt heads inside the flange. Position the bolts straight up and across from each other. Then put the new toilet gasket (wax ring) on the flange, with the flat side pointing up, if tapered.        3.  Lower the new bowl straight down, centering it on the wax ring and making sure both bolts come though the holes on each side of the bowl. Apply pressure straight down, pushing the bowl over the ring and flange, squeezing the wax to create a seal and mounting the bowl flush with the floor.        4.  Add washers and nuts to the protruding bolts and tighten until snug. (Over-tightening can crack the bowl).       5.  To install the toilet's tank, push two 5/16-by-3-inch mounting bolts through the small holes on the tank's bottom. Place rubber washers just beneath the bolt heads inside the tank to create a watertight seal. Add nuts and washers to the bolts on the underside of the tank and tighten until snug.       6.  Apply the sponge-rubber gasket (with small side down if beveled) over the discharge tube where the tank sets on the bowl.        7.  Set the tank on the bowl, threading the bolts into the bolt-holes on the bowl and sandwiching the gasket between the tank and bowl.       8.  Add metal washers and nuts to the bolts where they extend downward from the bottom of the bowl. Hold the tank level and tighten. It may help to hold each bolt stationary with a screwdriver inside the tank while backing up the nut with a crescent wrench on the outside of the bowl.        9.  Install a new toilet-flush handle by screwing the handle to the lift arm, through the handle hole in the tank. Toilet handles are threaded in reverse. Connect the lift arm to the chain of the flushing ball/flapper inside the tank.       10.  Bolt the new toilet lid to the bowl.        11.  Install a new water line from the wall or floor fixture to the feed valve on the underside of the tank. Turn on the water and check for leaks. Give it a couple of trial flushes. If your toilet holds water, tighten the bolts that hold the bowl to the floor. If there's any instability between the tank and bowl, or bowl and floor, use hard rubber shims, usually available at hardware stores, to adjust minor spacing problems and ensure a smooth ride.     12.  Once everything is in place and adjusted, cut the ends off the bowl-mounting bolts to accommodate the plastic bolt caps.  You may want to caulk the base of the bowl to create a waterproof seal, protecting the floor and providing additional stability.   Put on the tank cover, and your new toilet is ready for its maiden voyage.

Installing a new toilet is actually a rather simple plumbing procedure that can be accomplished in just a few steps. To install the new toilet, you'll need a new toilet gasket and two 5/16-inch bolts to mount the bowl to the floor flange, but most of the required parts will be included with the new toilet.   When removing the old toilet, shut off the water supply to the tank and flush the toilet. Use a bucket or cloth to remove any leftover water in the tank and bowl. Using a pair of pliers or small pipe wrench, remove the nut connecting the water line to the ballcock valve at the bottom, left side of the tank.                 Use a small crescent wrench to remove the two nuts that hold the bowl to the floor flange. Once the nuts are removed, lift and remove the old toilet.    Click screen to play a tutorial video on installing a toilet:                             1.  The exposed flange is the mounting base for your new toilet. Discard the old bolts.       2.  First, place the two new, 5/16-inch bolts in the holes located on the sides of the exposed flange, with the bolt heads inside the flange. Position the bolts straight up and across from each other. Then put the new toilet gasket (wax ring) on the flange, with the flat side pointing up, if tapered.        3.  Lower the new bowl straight down, centering it on the wax ring and making sure both bolts come though the holes on each side of the bowl. Apply pressure straight down, pushing the bowl over the ring and flange, squeezing the wax to create a seal and mounting the bowl flush with the floor.        4.  Add washers and nuts to the protruding bolts and tighten until snug. (Over-tightening can crack the bowl).       5.  To install the toilet's tank, push two 5/16-by-3-inch mounting bolts through the small holes on the tank's bottom. Place rubber washers just beneath the bolt heads inside the tank to create a watertight seal. Add nuts and washers to the bolts on the underside of the tank and tighten until snug.       6.  Apply the sponge-rubber gasket (with small side down if beveled) over the discharge tube where the tank sets on the bowl.        7.  Set the tank on the bowl, threading the bolts into the bolt-holes on the bowl and sandwiching the gasket between the tank and bowl.       8.  Add metal washers and nuts to the bolts where they extend downward from the bottom of the bowl. Hold the tank level and tighten. It may help to hold each bolt stationary with a screwdriver inside the tank while backing up the nut with a crescent wrench on the outside of the bowl.        9.  Install a new toilet-flush handle by screwing the handle to the lift arm, through the handle hole in the tank. Toilet handles are threaded in reverse. Connect the lift arm to the chain of the flushing ball/flapper inside the tank.       10.  Bolt the new toilet lid to the bowl.        11.  Install a new water line from the wall or floor fixture to the feed valve on the underside of the tank. Turn on the water and check for leaks. Give it a couple of trial flushes. If your toilet holds water, tighten the bolts that hold the bowl to the floor. If there's any instability between the tank and bowl, or bowl and floor, use hard rubber shims, usually available at hardware stores, to adjust minor spacing problems and ensure a smooth ride.     12.  Once everything is in place and adjusted, cut the ends off the bowl-mounting bolts to accommodate the plastic bolt caps.  You may want to caulk the base of the bowl to create a waterproof seal, protecting the floor and providing additional stability.   Put on the tank cover, and your new toilet is ready for its maiden voyage.

You only need four tools to get the job done right: a small wrench, a socket set, a flat-head screwdriver, and a level. You might also need a scraper and an old towel.   In a pinch, you can use two adjustable wrenches in place of the small wrench and socket set, although using the right tools to do the job will make the job much easier to complete... I started to say ""crescent(r) wrenches"" until I realized that Crescent(r) is actually a brand of adjustable wrenches and other tools, owned by Cooper Hand Tools, a division of Cooper Industries, Inc. Here is a clear case of the brand name becoming universally utilized as a generic product description.       Parts Necessary For Your Toilet Installation   You will need to get the toilet bowl, toilet tank, toilet flange bolts, and we recommend a kitchen/bath silicone caulk. If you have uneven floors or tile floors, you might also need some rubber shims. Since the wax bowl ring only costs a couple of bucks, I would recommend that you replace it too. You should get the one with the plastic flange attached to it.       Pulling Up Your Old Toilet   The first thing you want to do when you are pulling your old toilet up is to cut off the water supply. In most cases, you will be able to do that from a water shut-off valve at the floor level below your toilet. Once you have closed off the water supply, then you will want to loosen the water supply line where it enters the base of your toilet tank.   You will be able to flush out most of the water in your toilet tank and basin, but you will never get all of the water out. So, it is good practice to have an old towel lying around to soak up the small amount of water that will spill when you take out your old toilet.   You will want to detach your toilet seat and toilet lid before you haul your old toilet out of the house. That is done by loosening the nuts directly below the hinge on your seat, from below the porcelain of the toilet.   At the floor level, you will see two plastic caps that will need to be removed so that you can get to the nuts below. Once you have removed these nuts, your toilet should come straight up.       Preparing The Area For Your New Toilet   When you pull up the old toilet, you will find a wax bowl ring on the floor.   This is the only part of the task that can get messy. When you pull up the wax ring, you might have some of the wax stuck to the floor. You will need to scrape up this old wax. Your old towel comes in handy here as well, since you can use it to clean the wax from your scraper, so you don't have to get the wax on your hands.   If you are putting new toilet flange bolts in, now is the time to do that. The heads of the bolts have two flat sides and two rounded sides. Turn them sideways to get them into the flange, and then turn them where the cornered sides are under the lip of the flange. With your new flange bolts set, there will be a plastic piece with a cross cut from the middle. You should slide this over the bolt and push is towards the floor. This will keep your flange bolts from sliding out of position.       Prepare Your Toilet Bowl For Placement   Take your toilet bowl out of the box, and place it upside down on the floor.   At this point, you should put the level on the floor to make sure that you are dealing with a level surface. If you are not dealing with a level surface, you will need to use the rubber shims to stabilize your toilet once it is put it in place. You can use masking tape to fasten the rubber shims to the base circumference of your toilet.   If you have a tile floor, you will want to use the rubber shims to keep your toilet from moving or swiveling after you have set it in place. Any movement of the toilet bowl after you have set it in place might break the seal of your wax ring. If your seal is broken, you will run the risk of having sewer gas leak back into your bathroom, or you will find that your toilet leaks unclean water onto your floor.   Once you have applied the shims to the bottom of your toilet, you will want to place the wax bowl ring on the base of your toilet. The plastic part that drops below the wax is supposed to go into the hole in your floor that leads to the sewage drain, so apply it to the base of your toilet bowl facing away from the toilet.   The last step you will want to take before affixing the toilet bowl to the floor is to put some kind of marker down to show you where the toilet flange bolts are located. The last thing you want to be doing is to be hovering the toilet above the floor wondering where the bolts are so that you can drop the toilet in the right spot the first time. Whether you put a couple screwdrivers on the floor pointing to the flange bolts or put a pencil mark on the floor is up to you, so long as you leave yourself a way to make a visual alignment from above the toilet.       Executing Your Bowl Plan   Once you get through this next step, it is all down hill from here. It is now time to flip your toilet bowl over and then to slowly guide it onto the toilet flange bolts.   If you put good markers on the floor to remind you where the bolts are located, you should be able to put the holes over the bolts on your very first try. From personal experience, I can tell you that not marking off where your bolts are located will lead to many headaches.   Once you have your toilet bowl on the floor, gently press it to the floor. Sitting on your new toilet is often a good choice. If you sense a wobble in your toilet, you may need to affix additional rubber shims to level your toilet. You do not want to lift the toilet back off the floor unless you have another wax bowl ring handy. I also learned that from the school of hard knocks.   At this point, you will want to put the plastic piece with the square hole onto your bolt on top of the porcelain, then put the washer on, and finally start your nuts on the bolts.   As you put on the nuts, twist them down to just above the porcelain, and then turn each just a few turns before going to the other side. The point is that each side needs to be tightened just a little bit at a time. This is important because you do not want to over-tighten the nuts causing the flange or porcelain to break.       Attaching The Toilet Tank   In most cases, there will be a rubber gasket attached to the bottom of the tank. Just slip the tank onto the top of the toilet bowl, lining up the three holes on the tank with the three holes on the bowl.   If the tank did not have a rubber gasket on the bottom of it that also surrounded the boltholes, the tank will come with rubber gaskets to be affixed to your bolts before sliding them into the holes from inside the toilet tank. Just slide the bolts into the holes from the top.   Put your level on top of the tank to help you guide the tightness of your nuts. You will want to make sure that when you are done, your toilet tank is level.   Put the washers on the bottom side of the bolts, and then start the nuts on your bolts. Once again, you will want to tighten each of the three nuts a little bit at a time, so that you do not break the bowl or the tank. Use your flat head screwdriver to hold the bolt in place as you tighten the nuts.       Final Steps...   We only have three easy steps remaining. First, you need to reattach the water supply to the fitting on the bottom of the tank. Do turn on the water to make sure that you do not have any leaks.   Next, put a bead of your kitchen/bathroom silicone caulk around the front and sides of your toilet. You want to leave the back open in the event that the wax seal breaks at some point. Leaving that area open will allow you to notice a problem, before damage is done to the floor under the toilet.   And finally, you will want to put your toilet seat back on your toilet.       Ready For Use   You are now ready to use your new toilet. Most people can complete this job in just under an hour.       About The Author:    Cecil Radmore writes about home improvement.

Installing a new toilet is actually a rather simple plumbing procedure that can be accomplished in just a few steps. To install the new toilet, you'll need a new toilet gasket and two 5/16-inch bolts to mount the bowl to the floor flange, but most of the required parts will be included with the new toilet.   When removing the old toilet, shut off the water supply to the tank and flush the toilet. Use a bucket or cloth to remove any leftover water in the tank and bowl. Using a pair of pliers or small pipe wrench, remove the nut connecting the water line to the ballcock valve at the bottom, left side of the tank.                 Use a small crescent wrench to remove the two nuts that hold the bowl to the floor flange. Once the nuts are removed, lift and remove the old toilet.    Click screen to play a tutorial video on installing a toilet:                             1.  The exposed flange is the mounting base for your new toilet. Discard the old bolts.       2.  First, place the two new, 5/16-inch bolts in the holes located on the sides of the exposed flange, with the bolt heads inside the flange. Position the bolts straight up and across from each other. Then put the new toilet gasket (wax ring) on the flange, with the flat side pointing up, if tapered.        3.  Lower the new bowl straight down, centering it on the wax ring and making sure both bolts come though the holes on each side of the bowl. Apply pressure straight down, pushing the bowl over the ring and flange, squeezing the wax to create a seal and mounting the bowl flush with the floor.        4.  Add washers and nuts to the protruding bolts and tighten until snug. (Over-tightening can crack the bowl).       5.  To install the toilet's tank, push two 5/16-by-3-inch mounting bolts through the small holes on the tank's bottom. Place rubber washers just beneath the bolt heads inside the tank to create a watertight seal. Add nuts and washers to the bolts on the underside of the tank and tighten until snug.       6.  Apply the sponge-rubber gasket (with small side down if beveled) over the discharge tube where the tank sets on the bowl.        7.  Set the tank on the bowl, threading the bolts into the bolt-holes on the bowl and sandwiching the gasket between the tank and bowl.       8.  Add metal washers and nuts to the bolts where they extend downward from the bottom of the bowl. Hold the tank level and tighten. It may help to hold each bolt stationary with a screwdriver inside the tank while backing up the nut with a crescent wrench on the outside of the bowl.        9.  Install a new toilet-flush handle by screwing the handle to the lift arm, through the handle hole in the tank. Toilet handles are threaded in reverse. Connect the lift arm to the chain of the flushing ball/flapper inside the tank.       10.  Bolt the new toilet lid to the bowl.        11.  Install a new water line from the wall or floor fixture to the feed valve on the underside of the tank. Turn on the water and check for leaks. Give it a couple of trial flushes. If your toilet holds water, tighten the bolts that hold the bowl to the floor. If there's any instability between the tank and bowl, or bowl and floor, use hard rubber shims, usually available at hardware stores, to adjust minor spacing problems and ensure a smooth ride.     12.  Once everything is in place and adjusted, cut the ends off the bowl-mounting bolts to accommodate the plastic bolt caps.  You may want to caulk the base of the bowl to create a waterproof seal, protecting the floor and providing additional stability.   Put on the tank cover, and your new toilet is ready for its maiden voyage.

Football and rugby memorabilia covered almost every square inch of the bare block walls, and the ceiling joists were spider-webbed with extension cords that power his multiple neon beer signs, three television sets and a stack of stereo components.                                -

You can even collect it on the open road with portable solar equipment. Often configured with little or no wiring,  solar panels  for the RV just need to be  installed  and plugged in and can cost under $1000. More expensive systems consist of more numerous panels that can power a microwave.   The wattage capacity for RV solar typically ranges from 50 to 110 watts. They can power appliances directly or be plugged into a battery. Depending on the size and capacity of the solar panel, an RV class system usually powers a few small appliances at a time. You can use RV solar panels to run audio/video equipment, laptops, and other items.     The panels sit on the roof of the RV, absorbing and converting sunlight into useable electricity as you drive. Having a solar panel equipped with your RV ensures that you will have a backup power system anywhere you land, even while camping in remote areas.   RV solar panels are also a great alternative to generators that run on oil, gasoline, or natural gas. A panel can generate up to 300 watts of free and clean power, without all the noise of a fossil fuel burning generator. After storing the solar energy in a battery, an  inverter  converts the direct current into AC power to run your appliances. A controller helps keep your battery running at full capacity without overcharging.

Here's how to do it right:                             Whether your documents are in hard copy (paper) or soft copy (on          computer), use the same naming system for each. That way you avoid          confusion.                         Clean out all files regularly.                         Print out a master list of all your file headings. Keep a copy if it          handy. You can avoid making duplicate files that way.                         Keep the most current files on the top of the stack in each folder.                         Occasionally sort through and remove older documents for archiving.                         All files and file boxes should be clearly labeled. Use colored          folders or even the color labels available from DYMO for use with your          LetraTag Personal label Printer.                         Keep files sorted alphabetically or chronologically in your cabinets.

I got copies of the house key.   I took some old clothes and dropped them off at Goodwill.   Everything’s fine.       Posted in  family . Tags:  getting organized .  No Comments »         Moved a big chair downstairs   Tuesday, 28 October 2008 17:20 — monado       The chair in question is a single futon with a wooden frame and broad arms. It matches the couch and it should be downstairs to make more room for organizing upstairs. I’ve been putting off moving it from upstairs because I wanted to do it when another adult was in the house, in case I fell or got it stuck half-way. (It can unfold awkwardly.) But I never feel like it then, so I went ahead anyway. It looks fine in its new location and the cats like it.   The next step is to move some filing cabinets.

No Comments »         Homebox   Friday, 10 October 2008 20:12 — monado       There’s an  organizing box called the Homebox … it looks useful.   Homebox file organizer   From the web site:   Owner Jodi Sinden organizes everything within reach. While researching the Homebox, she helped de-clutter hundreds of households, thus learning first-hand how bad the problem really is. One thing she knows for sure: the average household has at least one shoebox with Really Important Stuff in it that nobody knows exactly where it is.   Prior to starting the company, she spent another life working in international development and commerce, helping to organize (of course!) trade missions, a world summit and really big scavenger hunts. She attended a grand total of six universities, and holds a degree in economics, which, since the advent of the Homebox, she knows exactly where to find.       Posted in  equipment .

No Comments »         Another heat alert day   Thursday, 17 July 2008 21:46 — monado       The smog alert and extreme heat alert have been extended through today and into tomorrow. It’s supposed to be 31 degrees tomorrow.   We try to keep a bubble of cool air from the cooler nights by closing up the house for the day. Some thunderstorms are expected. I wrote my science blog posts for tomorrow and scheduled them to appear while I’m working. I washed dishes, washed one load of clothes, and hung up two.   As you can see, it’s cooler in the evening:         Posted in  personal . Tags:  getting organized ,  personal .  No Comments »         Cleaning the kitchen   Thursday, 8 May 2008 13:29 — monado       I really should take before and after photos. I’m always much impressed by the “after” look. Today is the day to wash floors, de-clutter, re-arrange, and get rid of things I don’t use.        Posted in  personal . Tags:  getting organized .

Plan your garden? If it’s warm enough, plant a few things. Tell the people at the garden store that you’re looking for a new job.   If you have TV, turn on some of the daytime exercise shows and bounce along with them.   Start a daily stretching session- it will make you feel years younger. (Whartons’ stretch book is good–active isolated stretching or some such.)   When you can leave the house, walk at least 3 miles a day (1 hour at a reasonably brisk pace) - but start off with five days of 20-minute walks and 5 days of 30-minute walks to get acclimatized.   “Edit” your closets by passing along things you don’t wear, things you always put back for next time, things that itch, shrink, wrinkle at a hard look, or simply don’t flatter you. Compare them to clothes worn by people in the next level up of your profession.   If there’s a public pool, swim. Tell the people you meet at the pool that you can swim during the day because you’re between jobs right now, and you’re looking for a new opportunity.   Review what’s going on in your industry or one you’d like to be in and find out what skills you’ll need over the next few years.   Phone your employed friends, meet them for coffee, and ask what’s going on in their lives. Let them know you’re looking for work. Maybe they’ll have heard of something.   Learn to draw.   Mend things that need mending or throw them out.   Re-write your rsum.   Find out what school at The Boy’s next level of school is going to need by the time he gets there, and work with parents who are there now to help provide it. Mentiond that you’re looking for work.   Once Boy is well, run round and do all your long-term errands such as dentist, doctor, floor polishing, renew professional memberships, plan next year’s vacation. (Pitch tent in backyard? Need tent!)     I talk a good game, don’t I?       Posted in  getting organized . Tags:  career ,  getting organized ,  home ,  miscellaneous .  No Comments »         Spring planting   Sunday, 6 April 2008 20:15 — monado           see more  LOLcats   It’s time to start thinking about a garden, especially if food prices are about to go up.   Plantings are scheduled relative to the expected date of the last frost:       Six weeks before: lettuce       Four weeks before: peas?       Two weeks before: beets?       On the date: ?       Two weeks after: ?       Four weeks after: ?       Six weeks after: set out tomatoes       April 1, according to the  Sudbury Star : start tomato seeds.       Posted in  food ,   humor .

None of the starting modes work. I have to dig up some original disks and do something about it so I can get access to recent files and photos.       Posted in  getting organized ,   personal .

The Internet is the best market to find solar panels for sale, but even if you make a search online before you shop around there is still the chance that you won't find the best deals. Solar panels for sale can be a few hundred dollars cheaper than in regular hardware stores, which is significant if the sum applies per panel or per set of panels. Thus, eBay for instance is a good source of shopping ideas, the solar panels have full technical descriptions and the prices are among the most attractive. We should nevertheless warn the potential buyers of solar panels for sale that it sometimes happen that the merchant be unreliable, and risks do exist particularly when we are talking about such big sums of money as with energy renewable systems. Keep in mind that even large discount cannot go higher than a few hundred dollars, and suspect a scam if anyone offers you a deal for some thousands dollars less than the usual price. Therefore, always make efforts to check the credentials of the business that has the solar panels for sale. Take the contact details, give them a call and even check the address and the company's name. As a general rule, good solar panels for sale should cost between $7 and $9 per watt; for such prices the quality is pretty high for both mono and polycrystalline structures. If you are after some thin film panels with flexible features, then you can expect to pay a great deal more than that. The Internet also gives you the chance to calculate the need for solar panels taking into consideration geographical location, the grid or stand-alone system and so on.                               Presently, the obvious market tendency in what the solar panels for sale are concerned is a dropping one; this means that the renewable energy systems are becoming cheaper every day. Hence, it may probably be a good time to evaluate your electricity needs and see whether switching to solar is not a more advantageous solution for your household or business. People living in warmer globe areas will definitely require less energy production since their electricity needs are smaller without central heating being necessary, and for such cases, the prices will surely be lower.                                    © copyright 2008 yourdomain.com.

How a Solar Pool         Heating          System      works?     A solar pool heating system is simple to operate and  requires no change in the way you maintain standard pool equipment. The diagram  below shows the components of a typical solar pool heater system:          Black plastic   panels capture the energy from the sun and use it to heat the water in your   pool. Using the pump from your filtration system, water is circulated   through the solar panels where it is heated and then returned to the pool.   The system is designed to work with your existing pump, which need not   necessarily be situated near the solar panels.        A valve,   either manual or automatic, controls the flow of water in the solar panels.   The automatic option responds to changing temperature conditions and adjusts   accordingly to provide optimal comfort at all times.        As with any   heated pool, the use of a solar cover is always recommended – a practice   which actually allows you to swim earlier and later in the season, thereby   extending your swimming season.        Techno-Solis                  Solar Pool Heating Panel Features :                 Most        pool heating panels are designed to be repaired... Techno-Solis panels are designed to last.                     The majority of solar        pool heaters are designed with ""individual"" round flow        tubes so that if a tube leaks it can easily be plugged.        Some manufacturers even state in their warranty that a        damaged system will be repaired if possible. In most        cases a ""repair"" is nothing more than a plug. The        problem with this is that a plugged panel is much less        efficient or effective at heating your pool.          Another problem with the        design of most solar pool heating systems is that the        shape and thickness of the flow tube walls do not allow        for prolonged expansion or contraction that occurs        during seasonal temperature changes or extreme weather        such as freezing.          Techno-Solis' patented        flat panel design is proven to be more Efficient and        more Durable than other solar pool heaters.                                                                                                    Here’s why:                     Absorb more heat          Techno-Solis collectors are visibly thicker than          any other pool heating collector because we use          up to 35% more raw materials in our panels. This          attracts more heat.                    Reduce heat loss better  Techno-Solis flow tubes are connected so that they stay        warm longer. Other panels can cool rapidly during windy        conditions because the ""individual"" flow tubes aren’t        insulated by each other.                               Last longer    The extra material in our panels allows for greater        expansion and contraction, provides extra UV protection        and prevents weak spots.                                                                                                                               Prevent freeze damage          (covered under warranty)          Because water expands by approximately 9% when          turning to ice, the strain put on a solar          panel's flow channel can be devastating.          Techno-Solis pool heaters, however, are designed          to withstand internal freezing better than any          other panel on the market today. As the picture          to the right illustrates, the 2 keys to our          durability are the thickness of our panels and          the shape of the flow channels.            To get the full benefits of   a solar energy pool heating system you must have roof area for the solar   pool heating panels   that is large enough and has the proper exposure to the sun. The solar panel area required will depend on the surface area of your swimming pool, the   water temperature you wish to maintain your pool at, the amount of direct   sunshine on your pool and the orientation of the solar pool heating panels.      Additional solar  panels are recommended when one of the following conditions exist:                                                                The solar                                   panel will be installed     facing due east or due west.                               The pool or                                     panel area will be 25%            or more shaded.                               The site has a higher amount of average     wind.                               You simply want a very warm pool.                                                          Solar Swimming          Pool Heater Systems      are today the largest use of solar energy in the world and there are          several good reasons for this.
