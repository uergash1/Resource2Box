GX000-64-14847491	"VOLCANIC HAZARDS                Hawaiian volcanoes can erupt either at their summits or on their flanks. Young Hawaiian volcanoes, such as Kilauea and Mauna Loa, have summit calderas. A caldera is a crater several miles in diameter that forms as the result of collapse when magma drains from beneath the summit. (Magma is the term used for molten rock that is still beneath the earth's surface; it is called lava when it reaches the surface.) Summit eruptions of Kilauea and Mauna Loa occur within or near their calderas. Flank eruptions usually take place along rift zones, which are highly fractured zones of weakness within the volcano. Rift zones typically extend from the summit of a volcano toward the coastline and may continue for many miles under the sea.                             The Pu'u 'O'o vent began erupting in 1983 on Kilauea's east rift zone, 12 miles from the volcano's summit.  (Photograph provided by the National Park Service)                              Lava flows from the Kupaianaha vent on Kilauea's east rift zone bury a street intersection in Kalapana Gardens subdivision in December 1986.  (Photograph  by J.D. Griggs, USGS)                  Lava flows are the most common of the direct hazards created by Hawaiian eruptions and pose the greatest threat to property. Other hazards include airborne particles of ash, cinder, and fragile strands of volcanic glass called Pele's hair, and corrosive volcanic gases. Explosive eruptions occur much less often than non-explosive eruptions at Hawaiian volcanoes but have been witnessed in historic time. The greatest danger associated with explosive eruptions is their potential to produce pyroclastic surges. These surges are highly destructive, turbulent gas clouds that flow rapidly along the ground carrying hot ash and rock fragments. A lesser volcanic hazard is created by ground movement, which may result in large cracks across roads and other property or cause uneven settling of foundations. Generally, only areas near an active or recently active volcanic vent are affected by large-scale ground cracks and settling.    Lava  Flows    Lava flows are the most common of the direct volcanic hazards in Hawaii. Flows may endanger people's property, livelihood, and peace of mind, but seldom their lives. The fronts of Hawaiian lava flows generally move more slowly than the speed at which people walk, although the lava in the channel behind the front may be flowing much faster. On steep slopes a large flow could travel rapidly enough to endanger persons in its path. During the 1950 eruption of Mauna Loa, a flow front advanced at an average speed of almost 6 mph for over 2 hours.                            A lava flow from the Pu'u 'O'o vent advances down a street in the Royal Gardens subdivision in April 1983.  (Photograph by J.D. Griggs, USGS)                              Lava flows from Pu'u 'O'o had already cut a swath through the Royal Gardens subdivision when this photograph was taken in 1983. Many more flows were to follow. The  subdivision was developed on a steep slope below Kilaeua's east rift zone.  (Photograph  by J.D. Griggs, USGS)                   The speed of a lava flow is determined not only by the steepness of the terrain, but also by the volume of lava that is erupted, because large flows tend to advance more rapidly than do small flows. The distance that a flow travels ultimately depends both on the eruption rate and on the duration of the eruption.    The chemical composition of lava will also affect how rapidly a flow travels. Most Hawaiian lavas are classified as basalts, but within this category there are many types. Some basalts are more fluid and will flow at greater speeds than others. The eruption of Hualalai in 1800-1801 produced lava flows that appear to have been more fluid than flows from similar eruptions on Kilauea and Mauna Loa.                      An active lava pond overlies the Kupaianaha vent.  Lave enters the lava tube system at the far end of the long neck on the pond. (Photograph by E.W. Wolfe,  USGS)          The continuing eruption on Kilauea's east rift zone, which began in 1983, provides a good example of two common, but very different, types of eruptive behavior: rapidly-moving flows produced during brief, high-volume eruptions, and slow-moving flows created by a prolonged low-volume eruption. The Pu'u 'O'o-Kupaianaha eruption on Kilauea's east rift zone, which began in 1983, provides a good example of two common, but very different, types of eruptive behavior: rapidly-moving flows produced during brief, high-volume eruptions, and slow-moving flows created by a prolonged low-volume eruption. The episodic eruptions at the Pu'u 'O'o vent, which was active from June 1983 through June 1986, produced a large volume of lava within a few hours' time. These outbursts were characterized by spectacular lava fountains and lava flows that moved rapidly down the volcano's south flank. The flows entered the Royal Gardens subdivision during 7 episodes and destroyed 16 homes. Each flow was short-lived, however, and stagnated soon after the lava fountains died. None of these flows reached the coastline.    In July 1986, the site of the eruption shifted to the Kupaianaha vent, 1.8 miles to the northeast of Pu'u 'O'o. Kupaianaha erupted almost continuously for over 5 years but at a much lower rate than Pu'u 'O'o. During the first few months of activity at Kupaianaha, the lava flows did not advance more than a mile beyond the vent. But after months of continuous eruption, a lava tube system formed as channeled lava flows gradually formed roofs, enclosing the rivers of lava within. Lava tubes are significant in terms of hazard, since the tubes insulate the lava and allow it to flow much farther before cooling and stopping.                      A Kalapana house is ignited by a lava flow. By 1991, this  community lay buried beneath 50-75 feet of lava.  (Photograph by J.B. Stokes, USGS)             The hazards posed by a prolonged low-volume eruption soon became apparent as lava tubes from Kupaianaha extended toward the Kalapana coast. From November 1986 to October 1991, tube-fed flows repeatedly engulfed residential areas on the coastal plain, destroying 165 houses. Although these flows buried many acres within a single day, there was ample time to evacuate residents. Warnings issued by the Hawaii County Civil Defense allowed people enough time to remove most of their belongings and, in some cases, even to dismantle and move their homes. In 1992, the threat to inhabited areas eased when the eruption shifted to new vents on the southwest flank of the Pu'u 'O'o cone, inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.    The chief threat of lava flows to property owners is that the flows may burn structures and bury land. There are other effects, however, that may be almost as disruptive, as the Kalapana community discovered during the repeated inundations of the area by lava. In addition to destroying homes, the flows covered almost 2 miles of the coastal highway. Some residents were forced to move when the highway closure increased their daily commute by nearly 100 miles. Many more residents of the Kalapana area were faced with financial losses as land values dropped and insurance companies refused to issue new homeowners policies.   Even houses that are spared by the lava, however, may be rendered uninhabitable when the roads and utility lines leading to them are destroyed. By 1996, lava flows from Kilauea's eruption had covered 8 miles of the coastal highway, isolating the few structures that remained within the area.     Airborne Lava Fragments    Most volcanic eruptions produce fragments of lava that are airborne for at least a short time before being deposited on the ground. These fragments are called ""tephra,"" and include ash, cinders, and Pele's hair. In Hawaii, tephra is usually ejected by lava fountains and poses a serious hazard only in the immediate vicinity of an erupting vent. Windborne tephra, however, can be disruptive at greater distances. The combination of high lava fountains and strong winds may result in tephra being carried many miles downwind of the eruption site. During lava fountaining episodes at Pu'u 'O'o from 1984 to 1986, the prevailing trade winds deposited most of the tephra in remote areas of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, but small particles reached the town of Naalehu 39 miles away. During the same episodes, Kona winds (from the southwest) occasionally carried tephra to Hilo, 22 miles from the vent.                              The high lava fountains of Pu'u 'O'o produced black clouds of tephra,  cooled bits of lava that collected downwind of the vent to form deposits of cinders and  Pele's hair.                                       A close-up view of tephra, including cinders and Pele's hair (lower left).  (Photograph by J.D. Griggs, USGS)                  The small amount of tephra that fell on inhabited areas was not harmful to most people, but it was a source of irritation to those with respiratory problems and an inconvenience to the many residents with rain-water-catchment systems. Following at least three high-fountaining episodes, Hawaii County Civil Defense recommended that people disconnect and clean their rain-water catchment systems to prevent the particles from washing into their water supply.    Volcanic Gases                     Each episode of high fountaining from Pu'u 'O'o released a tremendous  plume of volcanic gas into the atmosphere.  (Photograph by J.D. Griggs, USGS)          Volcanic gases are emitted during all types of eruptions. Gases also can be released during repose periods by inactive eruptive vents and by fumaroles, vents that may never have produced any lava. The gas plume rising from an active vent on Kilauea consists of about 80 percent water vapor with lesser amounts of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Small quantities (typically less than 1 percent by volume) of carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen fluoride are also present. Extremely small amounts of mercury and other metals have been detected in gases emitted from vents along the east rift zone of Kilauea, but none have been found in concentrations large enough to create a direct health hazard.    Any hazard posed by volcanic gases is greatest immediately downwind from active vents; the concentration of the gases quickly diminishes as the gases mix with air and are carried by winds away from the source. Brief exposure to gases near vents generally does not harm healthy people, but it can endanger those with heart and respiratory ailments, such as chronic asthma.    A common gas produced during Hawaiian eruptions that is potentially harmful to human health is sulfur dioxide. Even small concentrations of sulfur dioxide can combine with water to form sulfuric acid, which can attack skin, cloth, metal, and other materials. When a volcanic plume mixes with atmospheric moisture, acid rain results. Acid rain can significantly retard the growth of cultivated or natural plant life downwind of a vent that degasses over a long period of time.    The sulfur dioxide emitted from Kilauea's summit during typical non-eruptive periods affects a relatively small area downwind of the summit. Similarly, the gases produced during short-lived eruptions affect only a limited area, although their odor may be detected many miles from the vent. The continuous emission of volcanic fumes during Kilauea's Pu'u 'O'o-Kupaianaha eruption, however, resulted in persistent volcanic haze and acid-rain conditions in the South Kona district on the leeward side of the island.                      Broccoli plants damaged by volcanic fumes from Pu'u 'O'o vent, 12 miles away.  (Photograph by J.D. Griggs, USGS)           In late 1987, studies conducted on private water-catchment systems in the South Kona area revealed higher than average acidity in several water samples. Drinking the acidic water does not pose a health hazard, but such water can leach lead from the lead roof flashings, lead-headed nails, and solder connections found in many plumbing systems, resulting in unsafe levels of lead in the drinking water. Extensive testing in 1988 determined that many water-catchment systems on the island, particularly those in the districts adjacent to or downwind of the active vent, contained elevated levels of lead. Residents with rain-catchment systems should contact the Hawaii State Department of Health for information on how to avoid lead contamination of their drinking water.    Volcanic fumes can also damage agricultural crops. During the 1969-74 eruption of Kilauea's Mauna Ulu vent, the South Kona district experienced prolonged periods of eruption-related smog. A study conducted in 1972 by the University of Hawaii's Agricultural Experiment Station at Hilo concluded that the acid rain resulting from the fume was responsible for severe damage to the Kona tomato crop. The Pu'u 'O'o-Kupaianaha eruption of Kilauea caused similar problems for vegetable and flower growers in both the Kona and Puna districts, who reported light-to-moderate crop damage during periods when winds blew the gases over their fields.    Explosive Eruptions   The rare explosive eruptions in Hawaii generally are caused by the interaction of magma and ground water. The magnitude of the resulting steam explosion varies from harmless to catastrophic. Small steam-blast explosions occurred during the 1960 Kapoho eruption when the magma beneath the vents, which were near sea level, encountered saltwater trapped in the surrounding rocks. These steam blasts ejected black clouds of pulverized rock fragments but were of little hazard except to scientists working close to the vents.                     The 1924 explosive eruption of Kilaeua mainly affected the immediate vivinity of Halemaumau crater.  (Photograph courtesy of the Bishop Museum)           A much larger steam-blast eruption occurred at the summit of Kilauea in 1924, when ground water apparently flowed into the heated rocks beneath the Halemaumau vent, which had been erupting nearly continuously for over a century. The explosions continued at intervals for 2 weeks, carpeting the area around Halemaumau crater with large rocks and a thin layer of ash. Boulders weighing several tons were thrown as far as 3,000 feet from the crater. The greatest hazard posed by this type of activity is that it may start abruptly and endanger unwary onlookers. The 1924 eruption claimed one fatality--a man who ventured too close to. the vent between explosions to take photographs and was struck by a rock when the activity suddenly resumed.    The largest explosive eruption on Hawaii within historical time occurred in 1790. This eruption produced pyroclastic surges (turbulent clouds of hot gas and rock fragments) that originated at Kilauea's summit and flowed several miles to the southwest. Pyroclastic surges are extremely dangerous because they move at speeds of 30 to 200 mph, and humans and animals caught in their path are killed by either asphyxiation or heat. A band of Hawaiian warriors traveling from Hilo to the Ka'u district to battle with Chief Kamehameha were overtaken by one of the 1790 pyroclastic surges, and about 80 of them were killed. The 1790 eruption left deposits of rock fragments and ash up to 30 feet thick on the rim of Kilauea's summit caldera.    The thick deposits of ash exposed at many sites on the island indicate that even larger explosive eruptions occurred in prehistoric times and probably originated from Mauna Kea as well as from Kilauea. Explosive eruptions of any size take place infrequently in Hawaii, but the possibility of one occurring in our lifetime should not be totally discounted. Such eruptions are unlikely to begin without some warning. The most widespread hazard from an explosive eruption would be windborne ash, which could damage structures, machinery, and agricultural crops.    Ground Cracks and Settling  Ground cracks and settling are commonly associated with volcanic activity; both generally occur near active or recently active volcanic vents as the result of shallow underground movement of magma. The beginning of an eruption at a new site is preceded by cracking of the ground as magma is forcefully injected into the area. The cracks may be as much as 6 feet wide and over a mile long; typically they form within a period of hours. The Kapoho area on Kilauea's lower east rift zone experienced such ground breakage prior to eruptions in 1924, 1955, and 1960.                             Before the 1960 eruption, a large ground crack opened in the village of Kapoho, which was built on Kilaeua's east rift zone. The village was later completely destroyed by the eruption.

Griggs, USGS)                    Ground settling may occur near a vent at the end of an eruption as magma drains away from beneath the vent area. This process produces both small depressions and large collapse features, such as the pit craters and summit calderas of Kilauea and Mauna Loa. In either case, the subsidence may be gradual or abrupt.    The hazard presented by ground cracks and settling associated with eruptions is usually limited to areas near the active vent and thus is overshadowed by the hazard posed by lava flows. Man-made structures that escape other damage from an eruption, however, can be damaged or destroyed by cracking, tilting, or settling of the ground beneath them. Ground cracks will remain after the eruption is over and can pose a threat to unwary people and animals if the cracks are obscured by heavy vegetation.

When such a large volume of magma is removed from beneath a volcano, the ground subsides or collapses into the emptied space, to form  a huge depression called a caldera .  Some calderas are more than 25 kilometers in diameter and several kilometers deep.       Calderas  are among the most spectacular and active volcanic features on Earth.  Earthquakes, ground cracks, uplift or subsidence of the ground, and     thermal activity   such as hot springs, geysers, and boiling mud pots are common at many calderas.  Such activity is caused by complex interactions among magma stored beneath a caldera, ground water, and the regional buildup of stress in the large plates of the Earth's crust.  Significant changes in the level of activity at some calderas are common; these new activity levels can be intermittent, lasting for months to years, or persistent over decades to centuries.  Although most caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, the possibility of violent explosive eruptions warrants detailed scientific study and monitoring of some active calderas.      Recently, scientists have recognized volcanic unrest at two calderas in the United States,    Long Valley Caldera in eastern California    and    Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming .    Whether unrest at these calderas simply punctuates long periods of quiet or is the early warning sign of future eruptions is an important but still unanswered question.          From:  Wright and Pierson, 1992, Living With Volcanoes, The  U. S. Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Program: U. S. Geological Survey Circular 1973       Caldera:  Large depression commonly formed by collapse of the ground following explosive eruption of a large body of stored magma.  Calderas at     Yellowstone   and  Long Valley    are associated with eruption of silicic magma  as pyroclastic flows that covered large areas around and within the caldera.     Kilauea caldera ,    by contrast, is thought to be associated with draining of basaltic magma from beneath Kilauea's summit.  The caldera now filled by Oregon's     Crater Lake    was produced by an eruption that destroyed a volcano the size of Mount St. Helens and sent     volcanic ash  as far east as Nebraska.         From: Christopher G. Newhall and Daniel Dzurisin, 1988,   Historical Unrest at Large Calderas of the World: U. S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1855, 2 volumes         Processes of Caldera Unrest:     Caldera unrest reflects    tectonic ,   magmatic , and   hydrologic  processes.  For the purposes of this discussion, we define   tectonic processes  as those that occur in country rock and dominantly involve changes in mechanical energy with little or no movement of mass into or out of the subcaldera environment.    Magmatic processes   are those that occur within a magma reservoir, and in which thermal energy, magma, and magmatic volatiles can (though need not) move into or out of the subcaldera environment.    Hydrologic processes  are those involving movement of subcaldera ground water or in which the physical or chemical state of subcaldera ground water is changed.  Probably no episode of unrest is purely tectonic, purely magmatic, or purely hydrologic, because tectonic and magmatic changes invariably influence a ground water system and vice versa, and magma (if present) invariably interacts with the local tectonic stress field.                Aniakchak Caldera, Alaska             From: U.S. National Park Service Website,  Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve, Alaska, April 2000        The  Aniakchak Caldera , covering some 10 square miles, is one of the great dry calderas in the world.  Located in the volcanically active Aleutian Mountains, the Aniakchak last erupted in 1911.  The crater includes    lava flows ,     cinder cones , and     explosion pits ,   as well as Surprise Lake, source of the Aniakchak River, which cascades through a 1,500-foot gash in the crater wall.

E. Scott           From: Tilling, 1985, Volcanoes: USGS General Interest Publication       An interesting variation of a     composite volcano   can be seen at     Crater Lake    in Oregon.  From what geologists can interpret of its past, a high volcano -- called  Mount Mazama  -- probably similar in appearance to present-day Mount Rainier was once located at this spot.  Following a series of tremendous explosions about 6,600 years ago, the volcano lost its top.  Enormous volumes of volcanic ash and dust were expelled and swept down the slopes as ash flows and avalanches.  These large-volume explosions rapidly drained the lava beneath the mountain and weakened the upper part.  The top then collapsed to form a large depression, which later filled with water and is now completely occupied by beautiful Crater Lake.  A last gasp of eruptions produced a small     cinder cone   which rises above the water surface as  Wizard Island  in, and near the rim, of the lake.  Depressions such as  Crater Lake , formed by collapse of volcanoes, are known as  calderas . They are usually large, steep-walled, basin-shaped depressions formed by the collapse of a large area over, and around, a volcanic vent or vents.  Calderas range in form and size from roughly circular depressions 1 to 15 miles in diameter to huge elongated depressions as much as 60 miles long.                 Crater Lake Caldera Menu               Hawaiian Calderas            From: Tilling, Heliker, and Wright, 1987, Eruptions of Hawaiian Volcanoes: Past, Present, and Future: USGS General Interest Publication        Hawaiian and other     shield volcanoes   characteristically have a broad summit, indented with a  caldera , a term commonly used for a large depression of volcanic origin.  Most calderas form by collapse because of removal of magma from the volcano's reservoir by eruption and/or intrusion.   Kilauea's   summit caldera is about 2.5 miles long and 2 miles wide.     Mokuaweoweo , the summit caldera complex of  Mauna Loa    is more elongate, measuring about 3 by 1.5 miles.  The terms  crater  or  pit crater  are applied to similar but smaller collapse features. ...       If the     hot-spot theory    is correct, the next volcano in the Hawaiian chain should form east or south of the big Island.  Abundant evidence indicates that such a new volcano exists at   Loihi , a seamount (or submarine peak) located about 20 miles off the south coast of the Big Island.  Loihi rises 10,100 feet above the ocean floor to within 3,100 feet of the water surface.  Recent detailed mapping shows Loihi to be similar in form to Kilauea and Mauna Loa.  Its relatively flat summit apparently contains a  caldera   about 3 miles across; two distinct ridges radiating from the summit are probably rift zones.                 Link to: Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Website for MORE Information                     Krakatau, Indonesia            From: Newhall and Dzurisin, 1988, Historical Unrest at Large Calderas of the World: USGS Bulletin 1855        The     August 1883 eruption of Krakatau    is often cited as    a classic example of caldera formation   by collapse following eruption of large volumes of pumice (Williams, 1941; Williams and McBirney, 1979; Self and Rampino, 1981, 1982; Francis and Self, 1983).  However, other workers have suggested alternate mechanisms for formation of the Krakatau Caldera.  Yokoyama (1981, 1982) concluded that the caldera formed by explosive destruction and reaming of the preeruption edifice, and Camus and Vincent (1983) and Francis (1985) favored an origin by large-scale collapse of the northern part of Krakatau Island (similar to the     volcanic landslide at Mount St. Helens on 18 May 1980 ).  Regrettable, much of the evidence is sumbmarine and inaccessible, but we are impressed by the similarity of Krakatau and other, better-exposed calderas (for example,    Crater Lake )   that are thought to have formed by simple collapse following voluminous pumice eruptions.  The volume of magma erupted in the plinian eruption (9 cubic kilometers) is adequate to explain the caldera without invoking a landslide origin. ...                Indonesian Volcano Menu                 Long Valley Caldera, California            From: Hill, et.al., 1996,   Living With a Restless Caldera -- Long Valley, California: USGS Fact Sheet 108-96        About 760,000 years ago a cataclysmic volcanic eruption in the  area blew out 150 cubic miles of     magma (molten rock)  from  a depth of about 4 miles beneath the Earth's surface.  Rapidly moving     flows of glowing hot ash    covered much of east-central California, and     airborne ash    fell as far east as Nebraska.  The Earth's surface sank more than 1 mile into the space once occupied by the erupted magma, forming a large  volcanic depression that geologists call a     caldera .       Today,  Long Valley  occupies the eastern half of this 10-mile-wide,  20-mile-long caldera. Magma still underlies the caldera and heats underground water. The heated water feeds local  hot springs and natural steam vents and drives three    geothermal power plants ,   producing a combined 40 megawatts of electricity.        The  Long Valley Caldera  is only one part of a large volcanic  system in eastern California that also includes the    Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain .   This chain extends from  Mammoth Mountain    at the southwest rim of the caldera northward  25 miles to  Mono Lake .   Eruptions along this chain began 400,000 years ago,  and  Mammoth Mountain  itself was formed by a series of eruptions ending 50,000 years ago.  The volcanic system is still active. Scientists have determined that eruptions occurred in both the  Inyo Craters  and  Mono Craters  parts of  the volcanic chain as recently as 600 years ago and that small eruptions occurred in  Mono Lake   sometime between the mid-1700's and mid-1800's.            From: Bailey, Miller, and Sieh, 1989, Field Guide to Long Valley Caldera and Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Chain, Eastern California: GSA Field Trip Guidebook T313        Long Valley      caldera    is located at the western edge of the  Basin and Range Province   straddling the eastern frontal fault escarpment of the  Sierra Nevada , in which it forms a reentrant or offset commonly referred to as the    ""Mammoth embayment"" .    The floor of the caldera ranges in elevation from 2,000 meters in its eastern half, where it is dominated by  Lake Crowley  and sage- and grass-covered  Long Valley ,  to 2,600 meters in its western half, which is hillier and heavily forested.  The caldera walls rise steeply to elevations of 3,000 to 3,500 meters on all sides except the east and southeast, where the floor rises only 150 meters before merging with the  Volcanic Tableland   at 2,300 meters elevation.  The  Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain   extends from the western part of Long Valley caldera northward  from  Mammoth Mountain   to  Mono Lake , a distance of 50 kilometers.

Catastrophic eruptions occurred here about 2 million years ago, then 1.2 million years ago, and then 600,000 years ago. The latest eruption spewed out nearly 240 cubic miles of debris.  What is now the park's central portion then collapsed, forming a 28- by 47- mile     caldera  (or basin).    The magmatic heat powering those eruptions still powers the park's famous geysers, hot springs, fumaroles, and mud pots.  The spectacular Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River provides a glimpse of Earth's interior: its waterfalls highlight the boundaries of lava flows and thermal areas.  Rugged mountains flank the park's volcanic plateau, rewarding both eye and spirit.

GX000-98-11729205	U.S. Geological    Survey Fact Sheet 073-97    Version 1.1          Future        Eruptions in California's Long Valley Area—What's Likely?                         Long Valley        Caldera and the Mono-Inyo Craters chain form a large volcanic complex in        eastern California that has had persistent earthquake activity and ground        uplift in recent decades. Volcanoes have been active in the area for millions        of years, and future eruptions are certain to occur. When the next eruption        in the area does occur, it will most likely be small and from a site in        the Mono-Inyo chain.                                                                                           The three            Inyo Craters, part of the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain, stretch            northward across the floor of Long Valley Caldera, a large volcanic            depression in eastern California. During the past 1,000 years there            have been at least 12 volcanic eruptions along the chain, including            those that formed the Inyo Craters and South Deadman Creek Dome (seen            here just beyond the farthest Crater).                    After four strong (magnitude    6) earthquakes rocked the Long Valley area of eastern California in May 1980,    U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists also detected evidence of renewed volcanic    unrest in the region. They discovered that the central part of Long Valley Caldera,    a broad depression formed in a cataclysmic volcanic eruption 760,000 years ago,    was slowly rising. Because such ground deformation and earthquakes are common    precursors of volcanic eruptions, the USGS has continued to closely monitor    the unrest in this region.   It is natural to wonder    when and where the next volcanic eruption might occur in the Long Valley area.    Geologic processes generally proceed at a slow pace, and when viewed on the    scale of a human lifetime, volcanic eruptions and destructive earthquakes happen    rarely. Nevertheless, the long history of volcanic activity in the Long Valley    area indicates that future eruptions will occur.   Geologists studying the    Long Valley Caldera have found that following its creation in the violent eruption    760,000 years ago, clusters of smaller volcanic eruptions have occurred in the    caldera at roughly 200,000-year intervals. About 100,000 years ago, the most    recent of these eruptions formed the Mammoth Knolls, low hills just north of    the Town of Mammoth Lakes.   Mammoth Mountain, a young    volcano on the rim of Long Valley Caldera, was built by numerous eruptions between    220,000 and 50,000 years ago. Volcanoes in the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain,    which extends from just south of Mammoth Mountain to the north shore of Mono    Lake, have erupted often over the past 40,000 years. During the last 5,000 years,    an eruption has broken out somewhere along this chain every 250 to 700 years.    The Inyo Craters and nearby lava domes were formed by a series of small to moderate    eruptions 550 to 600 years ago, and the most recent eruptions along the volcanic    chain took place about 250 years ago at Paoha Island in Mono Lake.   The pattern of volcanic    activity over the past 5,000 years suggests that the next eruption in the Long    Valley area will most likely happen somewhere along the Mono-Inyo volcanic chain.    However, the probability of such an eruption occurring in any given year is    less than 1%. This is comparable to the annual chance of a magnitude 8 earthquake    (like the Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake) along the San Andreas Fault in    coastal California or of an eruption from one of the more active Cascade Range    volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest, such as Mount Rainier.   As long as increased volcanic    unrest (including earthquake swarms, ground deformation, and CO2 gas emissions)    continues in the Long Valley area, the chances of an eruption occurring in the    near future will remain somewhat increased. However, evidence from large volcanic    areas and calderas worldwide shows that unrest, such as the current activity    in eastern California, can persist for decades or even centuries without leading    to an eruption. Nevertheless, recent eruptions at Rabaul Caldera in Papua New    Guinea (1994) and the Izu volcanic complex in Japan (1989) following short periods    of unrest emphasize the need to closely monitor restless calderas.   When an eruption does break    out in the Long Valley area, its impact will depend on the location, size, and    type of eruption, as well as the wind direction. Also, an eruption during the    winter months could melt heavy snow packs, generating mudflows and locally destructive    flooding.   Most likely, the next eruption    will be small and similar to  previous eruptions along    the Mono-Inyo volcanic chain during the past 5,000 years . Such eruptions    typically begin with a series of steam-blast explosions as rising molten rock    (magma) encounters and vaporizes underground water near the Earth's surface.    These blasts can throw large blocks of rock and smaller fragments hundreds of    feet into the air, leaving deep, circular pits like the Inyo Craters.   If magma reaches the surface,    gases trapped within it can escape explosively, hurling volcanic ash (tiny fragments    of the solidifying magma) as high as 6 miles or more. Airborne volcanic ash    can be carried hundreds of miles downwind, and the amount and size of falling    ash decrease with distance from the eruption site. Thin accumulations of ash    pose little threat to life or property, especially in areas where the roofs    of most buildings are constructed to withstand heavy snow loads. However, even    a light dusting of fine volcanic ash can close roads and seriously disrupt communications    and utilities for weeks or months after an eruption.                                                                       The eruptions            that led to the creation of the 600-year-old South Deadman Creek Dome            covered the area of what is now the Town of Mammoth Lakes with a layer            of volcanic ash about 1 inch thick. During these eruptions, the wind            first blew toward the northeast (tan) and later toward the southwest            (pink), spreading volcanic ash in the pattern shown on the map. These            eruptions also produced fiery flows of hot ash (pyroclastic flows).            Depending on the wind direction and the location of an eruption site,            future eruptions in the Long Valley area could spread volcanic ash over            the communities of Mammoth Lakes, June Lake, or Lee Vining (see also             eruption chart ). Pyroclastic flows incicated            by yellow and orange area.                          Explosive volcanic eruptions    may also produce fiery flows of hot ash (pyroclastic flows) that can sweep over    the ground at speeds greater than 100 miles an hour, devastating everything    in their paths. In the past 5,000 years, eruptions from several sites along    the Mono-Inyo chain have produced narrow, tongue-like pyroclastic flows that    extended more than 5 miles. Fortunately, the main population centers in the    Long Valley area are far enough from probable eruption sites that they are unlikely    to be directly impacted by future pyroclastic flows.   Less violent eruptions have    also taken place in the Long Valley area. These eruptions typically began with    mild explosions that formed relatively small volcanic cones less than 1,000    feet in diameter and then produced hot, fluid lava flows that extended a few    miles. Eruptions of this type about 5,000 years ago created the Red Cones, just    south of Mammoth Mountain. Flows of fluid lava were also erupted from sites    near the base of Mammoth Mountain between 400,000 and 60,000 years ago. Such    flows are highly destructive to property, but seldom endanger people because    lava flows rarely move faster than a brisk walk.   Although the chance of a    volcanic eruption in any given year is small, future eruptions will occur in    the Long Valley area. Because volcanic unrest can escalate to an eruption in    a few weeks or less, USGS scientists are closely monitoring activity in this    region. To be able to provide the public with reliable and timely warnings before    an eruption, the USGS has joined local and State authorities in developing procedures    for responding to changing levels of volcanic unrest in the Long Valley area.    The ongoing work of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program in this and other volcanic    regions of the United States helps to better protect people's lives and property    from volcano hazards.               David P.

It is a Tertiary to Quaternary  edifice exhibiting at least eight vents which produced mafic to felsic rocks.  Numerous feeder dikes to older units are exposed by deep erosion.  The volcano is dominated by porphyritic andesite to rhyodacite lava and pyroclastic breccias, although several Quaternary basalt flows and breccias occur on the periphery.  Plagioclase porphyritic andesite lava flows and breccia (0.5 to 1.0 million years ago) are the most voluminous rocks, with a maximum of 1,200 meters of total flow thickness.  The most recent volcanic activity occurred 2,350 years ago and produced three distinct units known as the Bridge River Assemblage.  ...

After Mount Rainier, it is the most heavily  glaciated of the Cascade volcanoes: the volume of snow and ice on  Mount Baker (about 1.8 cubic kilometers; 0.43 cubic miles)  is greater than that of all  the other Cascades volcanoes (except Rainier) combined.  Isolated  ridges of lava and hydrothermally altered rock, especially in the  area of Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper  flanks of the volcano: the lower flanks are steep and heavily  vegetated.  The volcano rests on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks  in a region that is largely non-volcanic in origin.   -- Gardner, et.al., 1995          Historical Activity        Historical activity at Mount Baker includes several  explosions during the mid-19th century, which were witnessed from  the Bellingham area, and since the late 1950s, numerous small- volume debris avalanches.  In 1975, increased fumarolic activity  in the Sherman Crater area caused concern that an eruption might  be imminent.  Additional monitoring equipment was installed and  several geophysical surveys were conducted to try to detect the  movement of magma.  The level of Baker Lake was lowered and people  were restricted from the area due to concerns that an eruption- induced debris avalanche or debris flow might enter Baker Lake and  displace enough water to either cause a wave to overtop the Upper  Baker Dam or cause complete failure of the dam.  However, few  anomalies other than the increased heat flow were recorded during  the geophysical surveys nor were any other precursory activities  observed to indicate that magma was moving up into the volcano.  An  increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker  from 1975 to the present, but there are no other changes that  suggest that magma movement is involved.   -- Gardner, et.al., 1995                 Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1995 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Gardner, et.al., 1995, OFR95-498             Mount Baker -- Living With An Active Volcano    -- Scott, et.al., 2000, USGS FS-059-00               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                .

It is not prominently visible from any major population center, and so its attractions, as well as its hazards, tend to be over-looked.   Yet since the end of the last ice age, Glacier Peak has produced some of the largest and most explosive eruptions in the state.  During this time period,  Glacier Peak has erupted multiple times during at least six separate episodes, most recently about 300 years ago.     -- Mastin and Waitt, 2000          Eruptive History      Glacier Peak is a small Cascade Range stratovolcano. Although its summit reaches greater then 3,000 meters above the surrounding valleys, the main cone of Glacier Peak is perched on a high ridge, and the volcanic pile is no more than 500-1,000 meters thick.  More than a dozen glaciers occur on the flanks of the volcano, and unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits over 12,000 years old have been largely removed by glaciation. Lava flows locally cap ridges to the northeast of the volcano.  While small basaltic flows and cones are found at several points around the flanks of Glacier Peak, the main edifice is largely dacite and andesite.  Lava flows extend no more than a few kilometers from the summit.  Glacier Peak is probably best known as the source of voluminous tephra eruptions dated to 11,250 years BP.  Two tephra layers produced at this time have been identified as far as 800-1,000 kilometers to the east, and are widely used by geologists, anthropologists, and paleoecologists to date late Pleistocene sediments.  Also at this time, an extensive valley fill of pumiceous lahars and alluvium was deposited downriver to the west, blocking valleys and affecting drainages as far as 80 kilometers from the volcano. After these major eruptions, Glacier Peak apparently was dormant for 6,000 years.  The volcano rewoke 5,500-5,100 years B.P. and intermittent eruptions of pyroclastic flows and tephra have occurred since that time.  perhaps the most dramatic geologic features at Glacier Peak are enormous and relatively undissected late Pleistocene and Holocene pyroclastic fans which almost completely fill valleys on the eastern and western flanks of the volcano.   -- Beget, 1994, IN: Wood and Kienle           18th Century      Indian legends and a thin tephra fall preserved east of the volcano may record a recent eruption in the 18th century, although no eruptive activity has occurred during at least the last 150 years.     -- Beget, 1994, IN: Wood and Kienle          Hot Springs and Dacite Domes      Three hot springs surround the volcano, and warm ground and snow-free areas occur near fresh-appearing dacite domes which form subsidiary summits both north and south of the ice-covered main summit.   -- Beget, 1994, IN: Wood and Kienle                  Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1995 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Waitt, et.al., 1995, OFR95-499             Glacier Peak -- History and Hazards of a Cascade Volcano    -- Mastin and Waitt, 2000, USGS FS-058-00                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                .

The Mountain is, however, the most dangerous volcano in the range, owing to the large population and to the huge area and volume of ice and snow on its flanks that could theoretically melt to generate debris flows during cataclysmic eruptions.     -- Swanson, et.al., 1989          Mount Rainier Dominates the Landscape      Mount Rainier volcano dominates the landscape of a large part of western Washington.  It stands nearly 3 miles higher than the lowlands to the west and 1.5 miles higher than the surrounding mountains.  The base of the volcano spreads over an area of about 100 square miles, and lava flows that radiate from the base of the cone extend to distances of as much as 9 miles.  The flanks of Mount Rainier are drained by five major rivers and their tributaries.  Clockwise from the northwest the major rivers are the Carbon, White, Cowlitz, Nisqually, and Puyallup.  Each river flows westerly through the Cascade Range and, with the exception of the Cowlitz, empties into Puget Sound near Tacoma, Washington.  The Cowlitz joins the Columbia River in the southwestern part of the State to flow to the Pacific Ocean.   -- Crandell, 1971          Eruptive Background       Mount Rainier is an active volcano that first erupted about half a million  years ago.  Because of Rainier's great height (14,410 feet above sea level)  and northerly location, glaciers have cut deeply into its lavas, making it  appear deceptively older than it actually is.  Mount Rainier is known to  have erupted as recently as in the 1840s, and large eruptions took place as  recently as about 1,000 and 2,300 years ago.   Mount Rainier and other similar volcanoes in the Cascade Range, such as  Mount Adams and Mount Baker, erupt much less frequently than the more  familiar Hawaiian volcanoes, but their eruptions are vastly more destructive.   Hot lava and rock debris from Rainier's eruptions have melted snow  and glacier ice and triggered debris flows (mudflows) - with a consistency  of churning wet concrete - that have swept down all of the river valleys that  head on the volcano.  Debris flows have also formed by collapse of unstable  parts of the volcano without accompanying eruptions.  Some debris flows have  traveled as far as the present margin of Puget Sound, and much of the lowland  to the east of Tacoma and the south of Seattle is formed of pre-historic  debris from Mount Rainier    -- Sisson, 1995                  Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            Revised 1998 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1998, OFR98-428            History and Hazards of Mount Rainier, Washington    -- Sisson, 1995, USGS OFR95-642             Mount Rainier -- Living With Perilous Beauty    -- Scott, et.al., 1998, USGS FS-065-97                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                               .

The nearby Indian Heaven and  Simcoe Mountains volcanic fields lie west and  southeast, respectively, of the 1250 square kilometers (500 square miles)  Adams field. Even though Mount Adams has  been less active during the past few thousand years  than neighboring Mounts St. Helens, Rainier, and Hood,  it assuredly will erupt again.  Future eruptions will  probably occur more frequently from vents on the  summit and upper flanks of Mount Adams than from vents  scattered in the volcanic fields beyond.  Large  landslides and lahars that need not be related to  eruptions probably pose the most destructive, far-reaching hazard of Mount Adams.     -- Scott, et.al., 1995           Eruptive History      Mount Adams stands astride the Cascade Crest some 50 kilometers due east of Mount St. Helens.  The towering stratovolcano is marked by a dozen glaciers, most of which are fed radially from its summit icecap.  In the High Cascades, Mount Adams is second in eruptive volume only to Mount Shasta, and it far surpasses its loftier neighbor Mount Rainier (which is perched on a pedestal of Miocene granodiorite).  Adams's main cone exceeds 200 cubic kilometers, and at least half as much more was eroded during late Pleistocene time form earlier high-standing components of the compound edifice: peripheral basalt adds another 70 cubic kilometers or so.  Nearly all the high cone above 2,300 meters in elevation was constructed during latest Pleistocene time, probably between 20 and 10 thousand years ago, explaining the abundance of late-glacial till and the scarcity of older till.    -- Hildreth, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Recent Volcanic Activity      Approximately 1,000 years ago: four tephra falls and perhaps small lava flows from two vents  on upper flanks.   -- Scott, et.al., 1995          Debris Avalanches and Lahars      During the past 10,000 years, the steep upper slopes  of Mount Adams have produced several notable debris  avalanches. In 1921, about 4 million cubic  meters (5 million cubic yards) of altered rock fell  from the head of Avalanche Glacier on the southwest  flank of the volcano and traveled almost 6 kilometers (4 miles)  down Salt Creek valley.  The debris avalanche  contained or acquired sufficient water to partly  transform into small lahars.  Ancient debris  avalanches of much larger size have also occurred at  Mount Adams, and these formed lahars that traveled  far down the White Salmon and other valleys.  An  avalanche of roughly 70 million cubic meters (90  million cubic yards) of debris initiated the largest  of these lahars about 6000 years ago.  This lahar  inundated the Trout Lake lowland and continued down  the valley of the White Salmon River at least as far  as Husum, more than 55 kilometers (35 miles) from Mount Adams.   The lahar deposit left in the lowland varies from 1 to  20 meters (3 to 65 feet) thick;  it is clearly visible today  as a sediment layer in the banks of the White Salmon  River and as isolated blocks (some more than 5 meters (16  feet) in diameter) that protrude from fields and meadows.   -- Scott, et.al., 1995                 Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1995 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Scott, et.al., 1995, OFR95-492               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                             .

Most were probably active for relatively short times ranging  from days to tens of years.  Unlike Mount Adams, which  has erupted repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of  years, these vents typically did not erupt more than  once.  Rather, each erupting vent built a separate,  small volcano, and over time a field of numerous  overlapping volcanoes was created.   Clusters of these vents define the Mount Adams,  Indian Heaven, and Simcoe Mountains volcanic fields.   In addition, the Goat Rocks volcanic center  lies 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of Mount Adams.   The Mount Adams and Indian Heaven fields  have been the most active recently; the Simcoe field  and the Goat Rocks center have not erupted for  hundreds of thousands of years.   -- Scott, et.al., 1995          About 60 Eruptive Centers      The Indian Heaven volcanic field, midway between Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams, is a Quaternary center, chiefly of basalt.

Geologists call Mount St. Helens a composite  volcano (or stratovolcano), a term for steep-sided, often  symmetrical cones constructed of alternating  layers of lava flows, ash, and  other volcanic debris. Composite volcanoes tend to erupt explosively  and pose considerable danger to nearby  life and property. In contrast, the  gently sloping shield volcanoes,  such as those in Hawaii, typically erupt  nonexplosively, producing fluid lavas that  can flow great distances from the  active vents. Although Hawaiian-type  eruptions may destroy property, they rarely cause death or injury.  Before 1980, snow-capped, gracefully  symmetrical Mount St. Helens  was known as the ""Fujiyama of America.""   Mount St. Helens, other active Cascade  volcanoes, and those of Alaska  comprise the North American segment   of the circum-Pacific ""Ring of Fire,""  a notorious zone that produces frequent,  often destructive, earthquake and  volcanic activity.    -- Tilling, et.al., 1990           Baron St. Helens      Some Indians of the Pacific Northwest  variously called Mount St. Helens  ""Louwala-Clough,"" or ""smoking   mountain."" The modern name,  Mount St. Helens, was given to the  volcanic peak in 1792 by Captain George   Vancouver of the British Royal Navy,  a seafarer and explorer. He named it in honor of a fellow countryman,   Alleyne Fitzherbert, who held the  title Baron St. Helens and who was at the time the British Ambassador to   Spain. Vancouver also named  three other volcanoes in the Cascades -  Mounts Baker, Hood, and Rainier - for British naval officers.    -- Tilling, et.al., 1990           Background      Ancestral Mount St. Helens began to grow before the  last major glaciation of the Ice Age had ended about   10,000 years ago. The oldest ash deposits were erupted at  least 40,000 years ago onto an eroded surface of   still older volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Intermittent volcanism  continued after the glaciers disappeared, and   nine main pulses of pre-1980 volcanic activity have been recognized.  These pulses lasted from about 5,000   years to less than 100 years each and were separated by  dormant intervals of about 15,000 years to only 200   years. A forerunner of Spirit Lake was born about  3,500 years ago, or possibly earlier, when eruption debris   formed a natural dam across the valley of the  North Fork of the Toutle River. The most recent of the pre-1980   eruptive activity began in A.D. 1800 with an  explosive eruption, followed by several additional minor explosions   and extrusions of lava, and ended with the formation of the Goat Rocks lava dome by 1857.   Mount St. Helens is the youngest of the major  Cascade volcanoes, in the sense that its visible cone was entirely   formed during the past 2,200 years,  well after the melting of the last of the Ice Age glaciers about 10,000 years   ago. Mount St. Helens' smooth, symmetrical  slopes are little affected by erosion as compared with its older,   more glacially scarred neighbors - Mount Rainier and  Mount Adams in Washington, and Mount Hood in Oregon.   The local Indians and early settlers in the then  sparsely populated region witnessed the occasional violent   outbursts of Mount St. Helens. The volcano was  particularly restless in the mid-19th century, when it was   intermittently active for at least a 26-year  span from 1831 to 1857. Some scientists suspect that Mount St.   Helens also was active sporadically during the  three decades before 1831, including a major explosive eruption   in 1800. Although minor steam explosions may  have occurred in 1898, 1903, and 1921, the mountain gave little   or no evidence of being a volcanic hazard for  more than a century after 1857. Consequently, the majority of   20th-century residents and visitors thought of  Mount St. Helens not as a menace, but as a serene, beautiful   mountain playground teeming with wildlife and  available for leisure activities throughout the year. At the base of   the volcano's northern flank, Spirit Lake,  with its clear, refreshing water and wooded shores, was especially   popular as a recreational area for hiking,  camping, fishing, swimming and boating.  The tranquility of the Mount St. Helens region  was shattered in the spring of 1980, however, when the volcano   stirred from its long repose, shook, swelled,  and exploded back to life.    -- Tilling, et.al., 1990           Mount St. Helens Awakens      The 1980 eruptions of Mount St. Helens in southwestern Washington marked the re-awakening of a relatively young (40,000 years) volcano that had been dormant since 1857.  Frequent dacitic eruptions during the previous 2,500 years had produced pyroclastic flows, ash falls, debris flows, lava domes, and lava flows of andesite and basalt.  Pyroclastic flows and lahars accompanied most eruptive periods and were largely responsible for forming fans around the base of the volcano, some of which dammed the North Fork Toutle River to form Spirit Lake between 3,300 and 4,000 years ago.  The magnitudes of the 1980 eruptions were not exceptional by worldwide historical standards; however, they were the first volcanic eruptions in the conterminous United States since 1914 (Lassen Peak) and focused national attention on events leading up to the climactic eruption of May 18, 1980.   That eruption led to exceptional opportunities for scientific observations, data collection, and the study of infrequent and often inaccessible geologic events and processes.   -- Simon, 1999              May 18, 1980      The catastrophic eruption on May 18, 1980, was preceded by 2 months of intense activity that included more than 10,000 earthquakes, hundreds of small phreatic (steam-blast) explosions,  and the outward growth of the volcano's entire north flank by more than 80 meters.  A magnitude 5.1 earthquake struck beneath the volcano at 8:32 a.m. on May 18, setting in motion the devastating eruption. Within seconds of the earthquake, the volcano's bulging north flank slid away in the largest landslide in recorded history, triggering a destructive, lethal lateral blast of hot gas, steam, and rock debris that swept across the landscape as fast as 1,100 kilometers per hour.  Temperatures within the blast reached as high as 300 degrees Celsius.  Snow and ice on the volcano melted, forming torrents of water and rock debris that swept down river valleys leading from the volcano.  Within minutes, a massive plume of ash thrust 19 kilometers into the sky, where the prevailing wind carried about 490 tons of ash across 57,000 square kilometers of the Western United States.   -- Brantley, 1994            Following May 18, 1980      Following the most recent major eruption, on  May 18, 1980, there were 5 smaller explosive eruptions over a  period of 5 months. Thereafter, a series of 16 dome-building  eruptions through October 1986 constructed the new, 270-meter- (-880- feet) high, lava dome in the crater formed by the May 18, 1980  eruption.   -- Wolfe and Pierson, 1995                   Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            Current Volcanic Activity -- Monthly Updates            1995 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Wolfe and Pierson, 1995, OFR95-497            Mount St. Helens -- From the 1980 Eruption to 2000    -- Brantley and Myers, 2000, USGS Fact Sheet 036-00              [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                               Oregon         .

It is the highest peak in the state  (3,426 meters - 11,239 feet) and one of the most often climbed peaks in the Pacific Northwest.  In summer, Mount Hood's timberline wilderness is a pastoral garden for backpackers.  In winter and spring the volcano's slopes host several downhill ski runs and cross-country tracks.   -- Sherrod, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Eruptive History       Mount Hood is also  one of the major volcanoes of the Cascade Range, having erupted repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of  years, most recently during two episodes in the past  1,500 years. The last episode ended shortly before the  arrival of Lewis and Clark in 1805. When Mount Hood  erupts again, it will severely affect areas on its  flanks and far downstream in the major river valleys  that head on the volcano. Volcanic ash may fall on  areas up to several hundred kilometers downwind.   -- Scott, et.al., 1997          Collapse of Lava Domes      Eruptive activity at Mount Hood during the  past 30,000 years has been dominated by growth and  collapse of lava domes.  The last two episodes of  eruptive activity occurred 1,500 and 200 years ago.  Repeated collapse of lava domes extruded near the site  of Crater Rock, Mount Hood's youngest lava dome,  generated pyroclastic flows and lahars and built much  of the broad smooth fan on the south and southwest  flank of the volcano.   -- Scott, et.al., 1997          Quicksand River      In 1805, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark  named a river on the south side of the                 Columbia River gorge the ""Quicksand River.""  Their description of a wide, shallow river                 with a bed ""formed entirely of quicksand,""  bears little resemblance to the narrow,                 moderately deep river we call today  the Sandy River. What happened? The answer lay                 50 miles away at Mount Hood.  An eruption in the 1790's caused a tremendous amount                 of volcanic rock and sand to enter the Sandy River drainage. That sediment was still                 being flushed downstream when Lewis and Clark saw and named the river. Since 1806,                 the river has removed the excess sediment from its channel. The Toutle River in                 southwest Washington was similarly affected by the 1980 eruptions of Mount St.                 Helens.   -- Gardner, et.al., 2000                  Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1997 Hazards Assessment Report     -- Scott, et.al., 1997, OFR97-89        Geological History and Field Trip Guidebook     -- Scott, et.al., 1997, OFR97-263        Mount Hood -- History and Hazards of Oregon's Most Recently Active Volcano    -- Gardner, et.al., 2000, FS060-00               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                        .

Mount Jefferson (one of thirteen major volcanic centers in the Cascade Range) has erupted repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of years, with its last eruptive episode during the last major glaciation which culminated about 15,000 years ago. Geologic evidence shows that Mount Jefferson is capable of large explosive eruptions. The largest such eruption occurred between 35,000 and 100,000 years ago, and caused ash to fall as far away as the present-day town of Arco in southeast Idaho. Although there has not been an eruption at Mount Jefferson for some time, experience at explosive volcanoes elsewhere suggests that Mount Jefferson cannot be regarded as extinct. If Mount Jefferson erupts again, areas close to the eruptive vent will be severely affected, and even areas tens of kilometers (tens of miles) downstream along river valleys or hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles) downwind may be at risk.    -- Walder, et.al., 1999          Upper Cone      Most of the cone (upper 1,000 meters) of Mount Jefferson is less than 100,000 years old, with much of it younger than the explosive event described above. The upper cone is composed largely of dacite lava flows and domes, many of which appear to have been emplaced when glaciers on the volcano were much large than at present.  It is likely that during growth of the domes, material was shed off to form pyroclastic flows and lahars, but if so, that record has been largely removed by glacial erosion.   -- Walder, et.al., 1999           Youngest Lava Flows      The youngest lava flows in the Mount Jefferson area are basaltic lava flows from Forked Butte and an unnamed butte south of Bear Butte.  Both of these flows postdate the large eruption of Mount Mazama (Crater Lake) of about 7,600 years.   -- Walder, et.al., 1999           Localized Floods and Lahars      During the last few centuries, several small lakes were formed on the flanks of Mount Jefferson when small tributary valleys became dammed by glacial moraines (ridges of sediment left behind by glaciers).  Several of these moraines have breached during the 20th century, producing local floods and small lahars.   -- Walder, et.al., 1999                   Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1999 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Walder, et.al., 1999, OFR99-24              [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                             .

The cone lacks a high-level conduit-filling plug, however, unlike other shield volcanoes such as nearby  Mount Washington south of Santiam Pass.  Three Fingered Jack is undated by radiometric methods, but its age probably lies between 0.50 and 0.25 million years ago (500,000 and 250,000 years ago),  as inferred from its erosional state compared to other shield volcanoes in the High Cascades.   -- Sherrod, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle               Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                            .

Mafic ash accumulated on the flanks of the shield and has been preserved as thick sections of palagonitic tuff on the southwest and northeast sides of the summit cone.  The volcano was intruded by a micronorite plug which now forms the central pinnacle, 0.4 kilometers in diameter.   Although no isotopic ages are available, all of the Mount Washington lavas and the underlying basalt appear to be of normal paleomagnetic polarity; the age of Mount Washington is probably no more than a few 100,000 years, similar to that of other central High Cascade stratovolcanoes. During the late Pleistocene, cirques were excavated into the flanks of the summit cone by valley glaciers which extended more than 12 kilometers east and west.      -- Taylor, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Recent Spatter Cones      The is no evidence of recent reactivation of Mount Washington volcanism, but a series of aligned small basaltic andesite spatter cones erupted on the northeast flank approximately 1,330 years ago (carbon-14).   -- Taylor, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                         .

This type of activity has built shield volcanoes  typically 5-15 kilometers in diameter and several hundred meters to  more than 1000 meters high.  Many have summit cinder cones.   Belknap in central Oregon  is the youngest such shield volcano in the Cascades and has lava flows  as young as 1,400 years.   -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1987           Eruptive History      The Belknap shield volcano  and its distal lava tongues cover 98 square kilometers of the crest of the central High Cascades in Oregon.  Prior to 2,900 years before present, the first eruptive phase distributed basaltic cinders and ash over a broad area to the northeast and southeast, while basaltic lavas moved 10 kilometers eastward from a growing shield.  A second phase, 2,883 years before present (carbon-14), produced an adventive shield of basaltic andesite on the east flank, known as ""Little Belknap"".  The third phase was responsible for the bulk of modern Belknap volcano.  It was constructed by effusion of basaltic andesite lavas from the central vent (Belknap Crater), 1,495 years before present (carbon-14), and from a vent 2 kilometers to the south (South Belknap cone), 1,775 years before present (carbon-14).  The final eruptions from the northeast base of Belknap Crater sent lavas 15 kilometers westward into the valley of the McKenzie River.   -- Taylor, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                   .

South Sister, Middle Sister, and Broken Top, major composite volcanoes clustered near the center of the region, have erupted repeatedly over tens of thousands of years and may erupt explosively in the future. In contrast, mafic volcanoes, which range from small cinder cones to large shield volcanoes like North Sister and Belknap Crater, are typically short-lived (weeks to centuries) and erupt less explosively than do composite volcanoes. Hundreds of mafic volcanoes scattered through the Three Sisters region are part of a much longer zone along the High Cascades of Oregon in which birth of new mafic volcanoes is possible.   -- Scott, et.al., 2001             The Three Sisters Volcanoes       The Three Sisters area contains 5 large cones of Quaternary age--  North Sister,  Middle Sister,  South Sister,  Broken Top, and  Mount Bachelor.    North Sister and Broken Top  are deeply dissected and probably have been inactive  for at least 100,000 years.   Middle Sister is younger than North Sister,  and was active in late  Pleistocene but not postglacial time.   South Sister is the least dissected; its basaltic andesite  summit cone has a well preserved crater.    Most of South Sister predates late  Wisconsin glaciation and is therefore older than 25,000 years;  however, eruptions of rhyolite from flank vents  have occurred as recently as 2,000 years ago.    -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1987             Latest South Sister Activity      The latest eruptions on South Sister, which occurred in two closely spaced episodes about 2,000 years ago, illustrate a relatively modest scale of eruptive activity.  Initial explosive eruptions produced small pyroclastic flows and tephra fallout from several aligned vents low on the south flank.  Tephra fallout deposits more than 2 meters (7 feet) thick, composed of pumice, rock fragments, and ash, blanketed areas within 2 kilometers (1 mile) downwind of vents;  at 13 kilometers (8 miles) about 10 centimeters (4 inches) fell.  Less than one centimeter (0.5 inch) of ash fell at least as far as 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the vents (at Cultus Lake) and east of the vents (at Bend).  Following tephra eruptions, lava emerged from two vent areas, forming a large lava flow, Rock Mesa, and several small lava domes.  Decades to a few centuries later, a similar eruptive sequence occurred along a zone of vents that  extended from just north of Sparks Lake to high on the southeast flank of South Sister, as well as along a shorter zone on  the north flank near Carver Lake.   -- Scott, et.al., 2001                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates               1999 Hazards Assessment Report     -- Scott, et.al., 2001, OFR99-437               Information Statement, May 8, 2001        Ground Uplift Near South Sister Volcano, Central Oregon Cascade Range         West Uplift - InSAR Monitoring                   [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                               .

Pleistocene eruptions of basaltic andesite lava produced a broad shield with a core of oxidized agglomerate invaded by dikes and sills.  Subordinate silicic magmas were erupted intermittently; andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite lavas, intrusives, and pyroclastic flow deposits are associated with the predominant mafic lavas from the lower flanks to the summit of the volcano.  The central crater of Broken Top was enlarged to a diameter of 0.8 kilometers, probably by subsidence.  The resulting depression was filled by thick flows of basaltic andesite and eventually the summit cone was buried beneath a shroud of thin, vesicular lavas.  After the central conduit had congealed to a plug of micronorite, the core of the volcano was subjected to hydrothermal alteration. Glacial cirques have been carved into three sides of the mountain, revealing internal structure.  Holocene eruptive activity on the flanks has produced  basaltic cones, flows, and ash deposits interbedded with Neoglacial moraines and outwash.   -- Taylor, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                           .

It has been built by thousands of eruptions, beginning about  600,000 years ago. At least 25 vents on the flanks and summit have  been active during several eruptive episodes of the past 10,000 years.  The most recent eruption 1,300 years ago produced the Big Obsidian  Flow. Thus, the volcano's long history and recent activity indicate  that Newberry will erupt in the future.   -- Sherrod, et.al., 1997           Newberry Caldera, Paulina Peak, Paulina and East Lakes      Newberry Volcano, centered about 20 miles southeast of Bend, Oregon, is among the largest Quaternary volcanoes in thee conterminous United States.  It covers and area in excess of 500 square miles, and lavas from it extend northward many tens of miles beyond the volcano.  The highest point on the volcano, Paulina Peak with an elevation of 7,984 feet, is about 4,000 feet higher than the terrain surrounding the volcano.  The  gently sloping flanks, embellished by more than 400 cinder cones, consist of basalt and basaltic andesite flows, andesitic to rhyolitic ash-flow and air-fall tuffs and other types of pyroclastic deposits, dacite to rhyolite domes and flows, and alluvial sediments produced during periods of erosion of the volcano.  At Newberry's summit is a 4- to 5-mile-wide caldera that contains scenic Paulina and East Lakes. The caldera has been the site of numerous Holocene eruptions, mostly of rhyolitic composition, that occurred as recently as 1,400 years ago. ... Newberry lies 40 miles east of the crest of the Cascade Range ...   -- MacLeod, 1981            Newberry Basaltic Eruptions      Basaltic eruptions are well known from observations elsewhere, such  as at Hawaii, where spectacular fountains of spatter and cinders are  associated with lava flows. At Newberry, basaltic eruptions have occurred  repeatedly on the volcano's flanks and in the caldera. Typical products  of a basaltic eruption are the 7,000-yr-old cinder cone of Lava Butte  and its surrounding lava flows, located 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of Bend.  Basaltic eruptions commonly begin with lava fountains that  hurl cinders or spatter as far as 1 kilometers (0.6 miles) from the vent. Ejecta  are thrown aloft for hundreds to a few thousand meters. Large fragments  are expelled from the vent along ballistic trajectories, like artillery  shells. Smaller particles are carried by wind and convective updrafts. The  resulting deposits may be many meters thick near the vent and build  a steep-sided cinder cone, but they generally thin to a few millimeters  within 10 kilometers (6 miles) distance downwind. The chief hazard from ballistic  ejection is direct impact. Some spatter will be hot upon impact and  likely will start forest fires.   -- Sherrod, et.al., 1997           Big Obsidian Flow      The eruptive sequence that culminated in the Big Obsidian Flow 1,300  years ago exemplifies several aspects of a typical rhyolitic eruptive  sequence at Newberry volcano. The eruptions began with tephra showers  that deposited pumice lumps and dense lava blocks as large as 1 meter (3 feet) within the caldera. ...  As the eruption progressed, pyroclastic flows swept downslope from  the Big Obsidian vent to Paulina Lake. The boat ramp at  Little Crater Campground is excavated in these pyroclastic-flow deposits,  as is the caldera road upslope from Paulina Lake. The flows entered  Paulina Lake, perhaps causing secondary steam explosions and displacing  water from the lake into Paulina Creek.  The final stage of eruption produced the Big Obsidian Flow itself,  a lava flow that moved slowly, probably advancing only a few meters  or tens of meters per day as it oozed down an inner caldera wall and  ponded on the caldera floor. The Big Obsidian Flow is about  1.8 kilometers (6,000 feet) long and locally thicker than 20 meters (65 feet).   -- Sherrod, et.al., 1997                   Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1997 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Sherrod, et.al., 1997, OFR97-513              [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                             .

Diamond Peak began erupting from a vent near its northern summit.  A second vent later opened near the southern summit, piggy-backing its lava and tephra over the previously erupted volcanic rocks.

Thielsen is remarkable even at a distance for its colorfully interbedded pyroclastic rocks that dip away from the jagged spire of the central plug, often called the ""lightning rod of the Cascades"".  The most spectacular views are on the north and east sides (accessible only by foot or horseback) where now-vanished glaciers have carved precipitous cirque walls that reveal the construction.  Thielsen's age is approximately 290,000 years (whole-rock  K-Ar ), and its geomorphology is a reference point for assigning Cascade Range volcanoes to the age division 0-0.25 million years (younger than Thielsen) or 0.25-0.73 million years (older than Thielsen).  Very little of Thielsen's underpinnings are exposed because Holocene Mazama ash, which erupted from vents at Crater Lake National Park (20 kilometers south), forms a shroud 4-20 meters thick in the Thielsen area.   -- Sherrod, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                       .

Prior to its climactic eruption, Mount Mazama's summit had an elevation between 3,300 meters and 3,700 meters (10,800 - 12,000 feet).

McLoughlin is easily recognized from as far away as Medicine Lake in California,  along I-5 between Yreka, California, and Medford, Oregon, or around the rim of  Crater Lake. Although it is the tallest volcano between  Shasta and Crater Lake, McLoughlin, with a volume of only 13 cubic kilometers, is dwarfed by the bulk of Shasta (350 cubic kilometers) and Mazama (130 cubic kilometers [Crater Lake]).   -- Smith, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Part of the Mountain is Missing      When viewed from the south or southeast it appears a seemingly perfectly symmetrical Fuji-like volcano.   However, when seen from the east, along the shores of Klamath Lake, or from the north along Crater Lake's rim, it is apparent that a major part of the mountain is missing.  Late Pleistocene glaciers have carved away the entire northeast side of the mountain, lowering the summit about a hundred meters, excavated the large bowl-like cirque, and exposed the congealed lava that fills two small central conduits.  Steeply dipping layers of pyroclastic breccia and tuff and numerous interlayered lava flows are exposed in the walls of the cirque.  An explosive origin is sometimes ascribed to this cirque; however, there is no evidence of deposits that would have resulted from such an explosion.  Glacial striae and other glacial features are common in the cirque, and glacial deposits such as moraines and till are present at the mouth of the cirque and around the north base of the mountain.  Finally, the composition of McLoughlin's lava is much more mafic than that of other volcanoes at which explosive events of the required size have occurred.   -- Smith, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          A Young Volcano      Mount McLoughlin is a young volcano.  A pronounced magnetic high centered just east of McLoughlin's main vent is interpreted as indicating that most of the main cone is normally polarized and thus less than approximately 700,000 years old.  The well preserved shape of the mountain's west and south flanks, the lack of soil development on many flows, and preservation of primary flow features suggests that the bulk of the main cone is no older than 200,000 years, with much of it probably younger.  The main cone was essentially complete before the last major Pleistocene glaciation.  Many flank flows are younger than the main cone; some may be as young as 20,000 - 30,000 years.   -- Smith, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                               California         .

The volcano is located in a zone of east-west crustal extension east of the main axis of the Cascade Range. The 1-kilometer-thick shield is 35 kilometers from east to west and  45-50 kilometers from north to south,  and covers more than 2000 square kilometers.   The volcano is composed primarily of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows, and has a 7 x 12 kilometer caldera at the center.   Eruptive activity during Holocene time has included numerous  rhyolite and dacite lava flows erupted at high elevations inside and outside the caldera;  cinder cones and associated lava flows of basalt and basaltic andesite have resulted from eruptions at  vents on the flanks of the shield.   Most vents are aligned along zones of crustal weakness that trend NNE to NNW.   -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1987         The Medicine Lake shield rises about 1200 meters above the Modoc Plateau to an elevation of 2,376 meters.  Lavas from Medicine Lake volcano  cover nearly 2000 square kilometers, and their volume is estimated to be at least 600 cubic kilometers, making it the largest volcano by volume in the Cascade Range.    -- Dzurisin, et.al., 1991          Eruptive History      Medicine Lake volcano began to grow about one million years ago, following eruption of a large volume of tholeiitic high-alumina basalt.  Similar high-alumina basalt has continued to erupt around the volcano throughout its history.  Although mafic lavas predominate on the volcano's flanks, all lava compositions from basalt to rhyolite have erupted during Pleistocene time.  The lower flanks consist of mostly basaltic and some andesitic lavas.  Basalt is mostly absent at higher elevation, where andesite dominates and rhyolite and small volumes of dacite are present.  During the past 11,000 years, eruptive activity at Medicine Lake volcano has been episodic.  Eight eruptions produced about 5.3 cubic kilometers of basaltic lava during a time interval of a few hundred years about 10,500 years ago.  That eruptive episode was followed by a hiatus that ended with a small andesitic eruption about 4,300 years ago.  During the most recent eruptive episode between 3000 and 900 years ago, eight eruptions produced approximately 2.5 cubic kilometers of lava ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite.  Late Holocene lava compositions include basalt and andesite, but silicic lavas dominate.   -- Dzurisin, et.al., 1991          The Caldera       Medicine Lake caldera is a 7 x 12 kilometer depression in the summit area of the volcano.   Anderson  (1941) suggested that the caldera formed by collapse after a large volume of andesite was erupted from vents along the caldera rim.  However, the distribution of late Pleistocene vents, mostly concentrated along the rim, suggests that ring faults already existed when most of the andesite erupted (Donnelly-Nolan, 1988).  No single large eruption has been related to caldera formation.  The only eruption recognized to have produced ash flow tuff occurred in late Pleistocene time, and this eruption was too small to account for formation of the caldera.   Donnelly-Nolan  (1988) concluded that  Medicine Lake caldera formed by collapse in response to repeated extrusions of mostly mafic lava beginning early in the history of the volcano (perhaps in a manner similar to the formation of Kilauea caldera, Hawaii).   She hypothesized several small differentiated magma bodies fed by and interspersed among a plexus of dikes and sills.  In her model, late Holocene andesitic to rhyolitic lavas were derived by fractionation, assimilation, and mixing from high alumina basalt parental magma.   -- Dzurisin, et.al., 1991          The Lake      The small lake from which Medicine Lake volcano derives its name lies within the 7x12-kilometer central caldera.   -- Donnelly-Nolan, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Glass Mountain Obsidian Flow      The most recent eruption occurred around 1,000 years ago when rhyolite and dacite erupted at Glass Mountain and associated vents near the caldera's eastern rim.   No field evidence has been found to substantiate a report of an eruption in 1910.    -- Donnelly-Nolan, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle         Glass Mountain consists of a spectacular, nearly treeless, steep-sided rhyolite and dacite obsidian flow that erupted just outside the eastern  caldera rim and flowed down the steep eastern flank of Medicine Lake volcano.   Ten additional small domes of Glass Mountain rhyolite and rhyodacite lava lie on a N25degreesW trend to the north and one to the south.  The age of Glass Mountain and its preceding pumice deposits has been a matter of discussion for some time.  A radiocarbon age of 885+/-40 years B.P. was obtained on a dead cedar tree without limbs or bark that is preserved in the edge of one of the distal tongues of the flow.  The dated material consisted of a piece of exterior wood containing about 30 annual growth rings.  This age may be too old, because some of the outside of the tree is missing.  The tephra deposits that precede the flow and domes may be somewhat older but are constrained to be less than about 1050 years B.P. by the  Little Glass Mountain and Lassen data.    -- Donnelly-Nolan, 1990                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                 [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                           .

One of the largest and highest of the Cascade volcanoes, snowclad Mount Shasta is near the southern end of the range that terminates near Lassen Peak.    -- Miller, 1980     Mount Shasta, a compound stratovolcano rising 3,500 meters above its base to an elevation of 4,317 meters, dominates the landscape of northern California.   ... Mount Shasta hosts five glaciers, including the Whitney Glacier, the largest in California.  Shastina is a large subsidiary cone that rises to 3,758 meters on the west flank of the compound volcano. ...   -- Christiansen, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle            Early Volcanic History      Mount Shasta is a massive compound stratovolcano composed of overlapping cones centered at four or more main vents; it was constructed during a period of more than 100,000 years.  Each of the cone-building periods produced pyroxene-andesite lava flows, block-and-ash flows, and mudflows originating mainly at the central vents. ...  Construction of each cone was followed by eruption of domes and pyroclastic flows of more silicic rock at central vents, and of  domes, cinder cones, and lava flows at vents on the flanks of the cones.   Two of the main eruptive centers at Mount Shasta, the  Shastina and Hotlum cones were constructed during  Holocene time, which includes about the last 10,000 years.  Holocene eruptions also occurred at  Black Butte, a group of overlapping dacite domes about 13 kilometers (8 miles) west of Mount Shasta.    -- Miller, 1980           Historical Activity      Shastina, west of the cluster of other central vents, was formed mainly between 9,700 and 9,400 years; the Hotlum cone, which forms the summit and the north and northwest slopes of Shasta, may overlap Shastina in age, but most of the Hotlum cone is probably younger.  Mount Shasta has continued to erupt at least once every 600-800 years for the past 10,000 years.  Its most recent eruption probably was in 1786.  Evidence for this eruption, recorded from sea by the explorer La Perouse, is somewhat ambiguous, but his description could only have referred to Mount Shasta.  A small craterlike depression in the summit dome, containing several small groups of  fumaroles and an acidic hot spring, might have formed during that eruption; lithic ash preserved on the slopes of the volcano and widely to the east yields charcoal dates of about 200 years.   -- Christiansen, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle           Debris Avalanche Deposit      For more than a century, hundreds of mounds, hills, and ridges of volcanic rocks in Shasta valley, north-central California, had puzzled geologists. ... Comparison with the Mount St. Helens debris-avalanche deposit,  however, clearly establishes that the hills are part of a giant debris-avalanche  deposit derived from a volcano ancestral to Mount Shasta. ...  The Mount Shasta debris-avalanche deposit covers and area of at least 450 square kilometers with about 26 cubic kilometers of debris --  roughly 10 times the volume of the 1980 Mount St. Helens avalanche deposit.  Radiometric ages of rocks in the deposit and of a post-avalanche basalt flow indicate that the avalanche occurred between about 300,000 and 360,000 years ago.   -- Brantley and Glicken, 1986                 Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1980 Hazards Report     -- Miller, 1980, USGS Bulletin 1503              [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                           .

The Lassen ""volcanic center"" began to erupt about 600,000 years ago.  From 600,000 to 400,000 years ago, eruptions built a large volcano, often referred to as ""Brokeoff Volcano"" or ""Mount Tehama"".  Later, this volcano became inactive and was mostly eroded away, leaving remnants that include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Diamond Peak.   Subsequent eruptions in the Lassen volcanic center have formed more than 30 steep-sided lava domes (the  Lassen dome field).  The most recently active parts of the volcanic center are Lassen Peak and other young domes formed in the past 50,000 years.  Clynne, et.al., 2000          Lassen Peak Volcanic Dome      Lassen Peak is the largest of a group of more than 30  volcanic domes erupted over the past 300,000 years in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California.  These mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes, were created by eruptions of lava too viscous to readily flow away from its source.  Eruptions about 27,000 years ago formed  Lassen Peak, probably within only a few years.  With a height of 2,000 feet and a volume of half a cubic mile, it is one of the largest lava domes on Earth. When Lassen Peak formed, it looked much like the nearby 1,100-year-old  Chaos Crags Domes, with steep sides covered with angular rock talus.  However, from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, during the last ice age, Lassen's shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion.  For example, the bowl-shaped depression on the volcano's northeastern flank, called a cirque, was eroded by a glacier that extended out 7 miles from the dome.   -- Clynne, 1998          Eruptive Activity During the Past 1,100 Years      Three episodes of volcanism have occurred at the Lassen volcanic center in the past 1,100 years.  These are the complex eruption at Chaos Crags,  the eruptions at Cinder Cone,  and the summit eruptions of Lassen Peak in 1914-1917.   -- Clynne, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Eruptive Activity 1914-1917      The most recent eruptive activity occurred at Lassen Peak in 1914-1917 A.D..  This eruptive episode began on May 30, 1914, when a small phreatic  eruption occurred at a new vent near the summit of the peak.   More than 150 explosions of various sizes  occurred during the following year.   By mid-May 1915, the eruption changed in character;  lava appeared in the summit crater and subsequently  flowed about 100 meters over the west and probably over  the east crater walls.   Disruption of the sticky lava on the upper east side of  Lassen Peak on May 19 resulted  in an avalanche of hot rock onto a snowfield.   A lahar was generated that reached more than 18 kilometers down  Lost Creek.  On May 22, an explosive  eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that devastated an  area as far as 6 kilometers northeast of the summit.  The  eruption also generated lahars that traveled more than  20 kilometers down Lost Creek and floods that went down  Hat Creek.  A vertical  eruption column resulting from the pyroclastic eruption  rose to an altitude of more than 9 kilometers above the vent  and deposited a lobe of pumiceous tephra that can be traced as far  as 30 kilometers to the east-northeast  The fall of fine ash was  reported as far away as Elko Nevada,  more than 500 kilometers east of Lassen Peak.   Intermittent eruptions of  variable intensity continued until about the middle of 1917.   -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1987                  Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            Eruptions of Lassen Peak, California, 1914 to 1917    -- Clynne, et.al., 1998, USGS FS-173-98               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                     References      Table originally compiled in 1997, redesigned in 2000, and continuously modified when needed.

""Crater Lake partially fills a 1,200-meter deep caldera, a depression formed by collapse of ancestral Mount Mazama during the violent eruption of 50 cubic kilometers of magma, or molten rock, about 7,700 years ago (6,845 +/_ 50 14C years before present). By comparison, Mount St. Helens in 1980 erupted about half a cubic kilometer of new magma. Geologic history shows that catastrophic events of this kind can repeat. Are volcanic eruptions likely again at Crater Lake? One of the approaches U.S. Geological Survey scientists are using to answer this important question is to unravel the geologic history of the Crater Lake caldera floor.""        --Dr. Hans Nelson and Dr. Charles R. Bacon   U.S. Geological Survey                                   Young calderas pose a number of hazards for human activity   The foremost threat from young calderas is that of renewed volcanism. Several post-caldera volcanic features are present at Crater Lake, although only Wizard Island breaks the lake surface. The youngest post-caldera volcano is a small rhyodacite dome in Crater Lake on the east flank of Wizard Island that dates from about 5,000 years ago. Another eruption of the magnitude of the caldera-forming event is unlikely within the next several thousand years: no volcanic rocks or layers of ash younger than the dome are known at Crater Lake, seismic profile studies of lake sediment show no evidence of subsurface magma movement, and there have been no earthquakes of the kind associated with volcanism. However, there is every reason to expect future activity in the place where it has been occurring for at least 400,000 years. Should there be an eruption within the caldera, it would likely happen underwater, increasing the possibility of enhanced explosive power due to the interaction of magma and hot rock with water.    Calderas filled with water can produce tremendous flooding in the immediate vicinity if the caldera wall fails, as happened to Aniakchak Crater in Alaska when its rim was breached. Crater Lake shows no signs of imminent crater-wall failure: the last major wall failure occurred over 7,500 years ago, after the formation of the subaerial central platform of post-caldera lava flows, but before the lake water began accumulating. The Chaski slide, one block of which forms a prominent bench east of Crater Lake Lodge, was the last major landslide event and carried debris to the center of the caldera floor.    Water-filled craters or calderas can release very large quantities of CO2 as happened at Lake Nyos, Cameroon, where hundreds of villagers in the vicinity of the Lake died of asphyxiation. Crater Lake, however, produces some circulation in its bottom half from hydrothermal activity on the caldera floor and strong circulation throughout from normal atmospheric influences. Moreover, sediment from the lake bottom shows no indication of the presence of gas, and the lake itself is surprisingly well-oxygenated, considering its depth. There is no evidence that Crater Lake is likely to turn over, as did Lake Nyos, and release large amounts of CO2.

Not drawn to scale or as an exact cross section line.                   Understanding the history and evolution of calderas may help scientists predict when and where disasters are likely to occur   The interdisciplinary study of the Crater Lake caldera floor required extensive logistical assistance from the  National Park Service  and collaboration with scientists from  Oregon State University  in use of underwater vehicles. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists determined the geologic history of Crater Lake itself through detailed studies of the caldera and the Pacific ocean floor. The climactic eruption of Mount Mazama resulted in deposition of pumice and ash over more than a million square kilometers of the Pacific Northwest. Soon after, ash deposited in the Columbia River drainage basin was transported westward from the Pacific coast up to 700 kilometers offshore on the northeast Pacific ocean floor by turbidity currents along deep-sea channels. Collapse of the former volcanic edifice along a ring fracture system, forming the caldera, occurred during the eruption and compensated for the ejection of the 50 cubic kilometers of magma. Part of the erupted material fell within the developing caldera to form a plug of intracaldera tuff that may be as much as 2 kilometers thick. The basin that now contains Crater Lake is the resulting collapse caldera, 1,200 meters deep and 8 to10 kilometers in diameter at the rim. In a matter of only a few hundred years, the caldera was partially filled, first with landslide debris from the walls and later with post-caldera volcanic rocks, water, and lake sediment.    USGS workers used Crater Lake's well-preserved, detailed geologic history to develop a genetic model of small caldera evolution   Post-caldera volcanic vents, geothermal features, and buried steam-explosion (phreatic) craters detected by seismic surveys collectively outline a ring fracture zone along which Mount Mazama subsided. These features began to form after caldera collapse about 7,700 years ago, but before the caldera filled with water to essentially its present level over the following 300 years. The large central platform of subaerial lava flows and domes erupted before the lake was present. Radiocarbon dates taken from lake-bottom organic matter indicate that the lake covered the central platform within at least 150 years of the caldera collapse. Wizard Island, one of the two major caldera-floor volcanic cones, erupted additional material into the lake as it finished filling. These subaqueous Wizard Island deposits accumulated to a height 70 meters below today's lake surface, and the subaerial island continued to grow nearly 250 meters above the present lake surface. Merriam Cone, the other large volcanic cone, erupted completely underwater, rising more than 400 meters above the caldera floor, but it remains 200 meters below the present lake surface.    Evidence for the timing of these events is found in detailed analysis of sediment sources and of radiocarbon dates from the central platform deposits. The age of the central platform sediment shows that the last main volcanic event, extrusion of a small rhyodacite dome east of Wizard Island, happened about 5,000 years ago. Investigations also show that the early lake sediment contained pollen from gradual re-establishment of post-eruption forest surrounding the lake as well as primitive diatoms that lived in the early, more hydrothermal water. Warmer and drier climatic conditions existed during the lake's early history, but a colder and wetter neoglacial climate has dominated for the past several thousand years.    There is evidence that large slope failures may have been triggered while volcanic and seismic activity continued up to 5,000 years ago. Since then, the geologic history of the caldera floor is marked by a distinct absence of volcanic activity. Mass wasting from the caldera walls continues, but on a much reduced scale. Lake bottom sediments now cover the chaotic subaerial debris wedges and volcanic deposits laid down as the lake was forming. This lake sediment blanket on the floor is well-bedded with a variety of sediment sizes ranging from gravel at the edge to very fine sand toward the lake center. Organic-rich muds also have accumulated on the submerged volcanic features. The lake sedimentation rate is currently high, but remains considerably lower than that found during the subaerial mass wasting that occurred before the lake formed.    Other USGS studies at Crater Lake, either published in scientific journals or in progress, include research on development of the shallow magma chamber which produced the climactic eruption, eruptive processes and caldera collapse as indicated by features of the volcanic deposits, and the early history of Mount Mazama and the many smaller volcanoes in the Crater Lake area. In addition, scientists from the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory periodically make geodetic measurements and look for tilting or swelling of the caldera area that might forewarn of renewed volcanic activity.            Interpretive drawing (right) of a continuous seismic airgun profile (left) across the east basin showing the subsurface sedimentary units of the caldera floor. The early lake sediment was probably deposited prior to 5,000 years ago while active volcanic eruptions were occurring, whereas the late lake sediment has been deposited during the period of volcanic quiescence over the past 5,000 years.

GX014-62-0246040	USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington                      Preparing for    The Next Eruption in the Cascades          -- Cascades Volcano Observatory, 1994,   Preparing for the Next Eruption in the Cascades: USGS Open-File Report 94-585                 Active volcanoes dominate the skyline    in many parts of  the Pacific Northwest. These familiar snow-clad peaks are  part of a 1,000 mile-long chain of volcanoes, the  Cascade Range, which extends from northern California to  southern British Columbia. Many of these volcanoes have  erupted in the recent past and will erupt again in the  foreseeable future. The time between eruptions is  usually measured in decades or centuries, so eruptions  are not a part of our everyday experience. However, in  1980 Mount St. Helens vividly demonstrated the power  that Cascade volcanoes can unleash when they  do erupt .    The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for  assessing volcano hazards, monitoring the activity of  U.S. volcanoes, and issuing warnings of impending  eruptions. To help prevent loss of life and property  from the next eruption in the Cascades, scientists at  the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in  Vancouver, Washington, are working to determine the type  and extent of hazards posed by the Cascade volcanoes.            Cascade Volcanoes        Eruptions in the Cascades   have occurred at an average  rate of 1-2 per century during the last 4000 years, and  future eruptions are certain. Seven volcanoes in the  Cascades have erupted since the first U.S. Independence  Day a little more than 200 years ago. Four of those  eruptions would have caused considerable property damage  and loss of life if they had occurred today without  warning. As population increases in the Pacific  Northwest, areas near the volcanoes are being developed  and recreational usage is expanding. As a result, more  and more people and property are at risk from volcanic  activity. The next eruption in the Cascades could affect  hundreds of thousands of people.              VOLCANOES AND WATER: A Dangerous Combination     Large parts of most Cascade volcanoes are covered with  permanent snow and ice that pose a special hazard during  periods of volcanic unrest. Even small eruptions can  melt a large amount of snow and ice, triggering debris  flows that can travel tens of miles beyond the flanks of  the volcano into populated valleys. Years after volcanic  unrest has stopped, erosion of deposits can cause  increased sediment that clogs waterways, disrupts  aquatic ecosystems, and worsens flooding. Debris flows  are the most costly effects of eruptions at snow-clad  volcanoes.            USGS CASCADES VOLCANO OBSERVATORY     -- Preparing for the Next Eruption             EVALUATING Volcano Hazards:    To identify the areas that are likely to be affected by  future eruptions, rock deposits from pre-historic  eruptions are mapped, studied, and dated to learn about  the types and frequency of past eruptions at each  volcano. This information helps scientists to better  anticipate future activity at a volcano, and provides a  basis for mitigating the effects of future eruptions  through land-use and emergency planning.                MONITORING Restless Volcanoes:    Volcanoes often show signs that they are getting ready  to erupt days to months in advance. Seismic activity,  ground movements, and gas emissions at Cascade volcanoes  are monitored by CVO in order to detect subtle changes  that may herald the next eruption. Seismic activity is  continuously monitored under the auspices of the USGS  Volcano Hazards and Geothermal Studies Program through  CVO, the USGS in Menlo Park, California, and the  University of Washington Geophysics Program in Seattle,  Washington.                COMMUNICATING Hazards Information    CVO provides information about volcanoes and volcano  hazards to public officials, land-use planners,  emergency response organizations, the Federal Aviation  Administration and other federal agencies, the news  media, schools, and the general public. When volcanic  activity increases, CVO issues advisories, warnings, and  whenever possible, specific predictions concerning  eruptions and their potential impacts.          DEVELOPING New Tools, Testing New Ideas:    USGS scientists study Mount St. Helens and other  volcanoes around the world to develop new ideas about  how volcanoes work and to improve eruption-prediction  methods. Related research topics include dynamics of  debris flows, effects of volcanic gases on weather and  climate, and effects of increased sediment transport on  streams. New instrumentation, software, and hardware  developed by the USGS enable scientists to acquire,  process, and interpret data more quickly and effectively  than ever before.                READY to Respond:    At CVO, a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and a  cache of portable volcano-monitoring equipment function  as a mobile volcano observatory ready to respond to  volcanic unrest anywhere in the U. S. and, in cooperation  with the U. S. Agency for International Development's  Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, anywhere in the  world. Since 1980 this team has responded to volcanic  unrest in Alaska, California, Washington, Colombia,  Ecuador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea,  and the Philippines.              The USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory strives to serve  the national interest by helping people to live  knowledgeably and safely with volcanoes and related  natural hazards including earthquakes, landslides, and  debris flows in the western United States and elsewhere  in the world. CVO assesses hazards before they occur by  identifying and studying past hazardous events. We  provide warnings during volcanic crises by intensively  monitoring restless volcanoes and interpreting results  in the context of current hazards assessments. We  investigate and report on hazardous events after they  occur to improve our assessment and prediction skills,  and to help develop new concepts of how volcanoes work.            Our goal is to keep natural processes from becoming  natural disasters.                       Return to:      [Report Menu]  ...      [Read About Volcanoes Menu]  ...

GX001-37-3213127	"U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 059-00  Online Version 1.0    Mount BakerLiving with an Active Volcano                             Mount Baker     dominates the skyline from Bellingham, Washington, and Vancouver, British     Columbia. On cold, clear winter days, dramatic increases in the steam plume     rising continuously from Sherman Crater can alarm local residents. This     apparent increase in plume vigor occurs because of condensation of steam in     cold, calm air. In 1975, however, increased steaming and melting of snow and     ice around Sherman Crater did signify a change in heat output from the     volcano's interior. Although the increased heat flow gradually subsided, it     could have signaled the start of eruptive activity, and precautions were     wisely undertaken. So that the public can be warned of, and be prepared for,     future eruptions and other hazardous events at Mount Baker, U.S. Geological     Survey (USGS) scientists are studying the volcano's past behavior and     monitoring its current activity.                                                                                                       Mount Baker (10,781 feet) viewed from east side with steam plume rising from         Sherman Crater (left side of summit, small photo shows crater interior). Scar of         the 1891 flank collapse is visible in lower left of photo. Photos by Kevin         Scott and Robert Symonds, USGS.                                            WHAT ARE THE HAZARDS?       The next  eruption of Mount Baker may produce  lava flows, pyroclastic flows,  volcanic ash  (tephra) , and  lahars  . Lahars are by far the greatest concern at Mount Baker because of its history of frequent lahars, the ability of lahars to flow for tens of miles, and the potential for hazardous future impacts of lahars on two reservoirs on the east side of the volcano. Tephra hazards at Mount Baker are less important than at neighboring Glacier Peak volcano to the south.    Lahars can originate in two ways:    1) During eruptions, pyroclastic flows can melt snow and ice to create torrents of ash, rock, and water that move downvalley as sandy (noncohesive) lahars.   2) Because the volcano is locally weakened and altered to clay by percolating, acidic, hot water and steam (like that venting from Sherman Crater), future volcanic landslides known as flank collapses can mobilize to form muddy (cohesive) lahars.    Lahars of collapse origin occur during eruptions. They also occur during  non-eruptive periods triggered by regional earthquakes, gravity, or increases in hydrovolcanic activity not associated with magma intrusion.    When ground water comes in contact with either magma or hot rock, hydrovolcanic explosions of steam and rock can occur. Such events, in addition to possibly triggering collapse, can themselves be hazardous.           MOUNT BAKEREARLY HISTORY     USGS research in the last decade shows Mount Baker to be the youngest of several volcanic centers in the area and one of the youngest volcanoes in the Cascade Range. Volcanic activity in the Mount Baker area began more than one million years ago, but many of the earliest lava and tephra deposits have been removed by glacial erosion. The pale-colored rocks northeast of the modern volcano mark the site of ancient Kulshan Caldera that collapsed after an enormous ash eruption one million years ago. Subsequently, eruptions in the Mount Baker area have produced cones and lava flows of andesite, the rock that makes up much of other Cascade Range volcanoes like Mounts Rainier, Adams, and Hood. From about 900,000 years ago to the present, numerous andesitic volcanic centers in the area have come and gone, eroded by glaciers. The largest is the Black Buttes edifice, active between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago and formerly bigger than today's Mount Baker.    Although numerous in Oregon and southern Washington, cinder  cones formed of the rock type called basalt are rare around Mount Baker. A  cinder cone that formed 9,800 years ago in Schriebers Meadow produced a  widespread tephra layer, and lava flows that reached the Baker River.                                                                                      click         here for larger version of graphic                                     Eruptions and flank collapses at Mount Baker during the past 12,000 years.                                          TODAY'S MOUNT BAKER    Modern Mount  Baker formed during and since the last ice age, which ended about  15,000 years ago. Lava flows from the summit vent erupted between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago and, during the final stages of edifice construction, blocky pyroclastic flows poured down most of the volcano's drainages. An eruption 6,600 years ago produced a blanket of ash that extended more than 20 miles to the northeast. This eruption probably occurred from the presently ice-filled summit crater. Subsequently, sulfurous gases have found two pathways to the  surfaceDorr Fumaroles, northeast of the summit, and Sherman Crater, south of the summit. Both these area are sites of pervasive bedrock alteration, converting lavas to weak, white-to-yellow material rich in clays, silica, and sulfur-bearing minerals. At Sherman Crater, collapses of this weakened rock created lahars in 1843 and as recently as the 1970's.       PAST  EVENTS FUTURE HAZARDS    Like most volcanoes, Mount Baker's history records great variations in behavior. Scientists believe the following case histories are good examples of the range in size and types of hazardous activity that have occurred in the past and could occur again. Small events are more common than large ones, and during a future hazardous event only parts of the hazard zones shown on the map may be affected.

Flank Collapses, Lahars, and Tephra Eruptions,  about 6,600 Years Ago     A series of discrete events culminated with the largest tephra-producing eruption in post- glacial time at Mount Baker. First, the largest collapse in the history of the volcano occurred from the Roman Wall (see map) and transformed into a lahar that was over 300 feet deep in the upper reaches of the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River. It was at least 25 feet deep 30 miles downstream from the volcano and probably reached Bellingham Bay. Next, a huge hydrovolcanic explosion occurred near the site of present day Sherman Crater, triggering a second collapse of the flank just east of the Roman Wall. That collapse also became a lahar that mainly followed the course of the first one for at least 20 miles, but also spilled into tributaries of the Baker River. Finally, an eruption cloud deposited several inches of ash as far as 20 miles downwind to the northeast.      Sherman Crater Forms in 1843     The present shape of Sherman Crater originated with a large hydrovolcanic explosion. In 1843, explorers reported a widespread layer of newly fallen rock fragments ""like a snowfall"" and the forest ""on fire for miles around."" Rivers south of the volcano were clogged with ash, and Native Americans reported that many salmon were killed. A short time later, two collapses of the east side of Sherman Crater produced two lahars, the first and larger of which flowed into the natural Baker Lake, raising its level at least 10 feet. The location of this 19th-century lake is now covered by waters of the modern dam-impounded Baker Lake. Similar but lower level hydrovolcanic activity at Sherman Crater continued intermittently for several decades afterwards.

Flank Collapse and Lahar in 1891     In 1891, about 20 million cubic yards of rock fell from the scar shown in the photo on the front page, producing a lahar that traveled more than 6 miles and covered 1 square mile.      Sherman Crater Heats Up in 1975, Triggering Concern     In 1975, scientists believed that the dramatic increase in the steam plume and heat output  from Sherman Crater could herald either a new magmatic eruption or hydrovolcanic activity like that of 1843. Either of these possibilities would have increased the risk of collapse, raising concerns that lahars could flow rapidly into Baker Lake or Lake Shannon, displacing water and creating a flood surge or even causing dam failure. The volcano was subjected to the most intensive monitoring ever applied to a Cascade Range volcano up to that time. As time passed, no signs of rising  magmaearthquakes, significant changes in gas composition, or surface deformationappeared. The main risk, therefore, was of flank collapses and lahars similar to those of 1843 (Map Inundation Zone II). Had magmatic activity been confirmed, a much larger collapse  and flow would have been possible (Map Inundation Zone I), and a magmatic eruption could have ensued like those between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago or that of 6,600 years ago.    When magmatic activity does recur, all the drainages of Mount Baker will be at risk from lahars, and upstream areas will be at risk from pyroclastic flows and lava flows in the hazard zone shown on the map. The Dorr Fumaroles are also a potential site of hydrovolcanic explosions. Steep headwalls on the north flank are also at risk of flank collapse, but Sherman Crater is the most likely area on Mount Baker for renewed failure.    On the basis of conclusions by USGS scientists in June 1975,an interagency task force advised lowering the level of Baker Lake so that it could accommodate lahar inflow without displacing water from the reservoir that could have flooded the downstream Skagit River valley. Because a lahar could also trigger waves that would inundate areas around the lake, shoreline residences, campgrounds, and businesses were evacuated. On the basis of recent research, the west side of Sherman Crater, site of a previous collapse, could also be unstable. Today, if there were a similar increase in activity at Sherman Crater, USGS scientists might also recommend drawdown of Lake Shannon, the smaller downstream reservoir that is the catchment for drainages from the west side of the crater.                                                                       This notice         was posted at campgrounds around Baker Lake by the US Forest        Service in June 1975. Normally, Baker Reservoir approaches capacity during        mid-summer. At most other times, reservoir levels are low enough to impound        lahars the size of those that occurred in 1843.                                           MONITORING FOR THE FUTURE     The University of Washington Geophysics Program, in cooperation with the USGS, monitors seismic (earthquake) activity at Mount Baker and other Cascade Range volcanoes. Seismic activity is the most common precursor of magma intrusion, which potentially could lead to an eruption. The risk and potential size of flank collapse and lahars increase progressively as magma rises toward and into a volcano's edifice.     The USGS monitors gas emissions from Sherman Crater in order to detect changes in the volcano's ""plumbing system"" that may be a warning of impending magmatic activity or an increase in hydrovolcanic activity, and thus an increased chance of eruption or collapse.

Introduction   The eruption has progressed through three main epochs:  3.5 years of episodic fountaining, mainly from the Pu‘u ‘O‘o central vent, producing a cinder-and-spatter cone and ‘a‘a flows; 5.5 years of continuous effusion from the Kupaianaha vent, producing a shield and tube-fed pahoehoe flows; and over 11 years (as of January 2003) of nearly continuous effusion from flank vents on Pu‘u ‘O‘o, again producing a shield and tube-fed pahoehoe flows.     Episodes     1983–1986:  The Rise of Pu‘u ‘O‘o–Episodic Lava Fountains Build Massive Cone   The Pu‘u ‘O‘o–Kupaianaha eruption began on January 3, 1983.  For the first six months (episodes 1–3), fissures erupted intermittently along the middle east rift zone from Napau Crater to Kalalua.  In June 1983, the activity became localized at the Pu‘u ‘O‘o vent, which straddles the boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park.  For the next three years (episodes 4–47), Pu‘u ‘O‘o erupted approximately every three to four weeks, usually for less than 24 hours.  Spectacular lava fountains that catapulted lava as high as 470 m above the vent characterized these eruptive episodes.    The high fountains produced mainly ‘a‘a flows, the more viscous and gas-poor of the two types of Hawaiian lava.  ‘A‘a flows from Pu‘u ‘O‘o were typically 3–5 m thick and advanced at speeds of 50–500 m/h, picking up speed and narrowing on steep slopes.  Because of the short duration of each eruptive episode, none of these flows reached the ocean or the coastal highway.  The flows posed an immediate threat, however, to the sparsely populated Royal Gardens subdivision, located on a steep slope 6 km southeast of the vent.  ‘A‘a flows reached the subdivision in as little as 13 hours during several eruptive episodes and destroyed 16 houses in 1983 and 1984.   Fallout from the towering lava fountains built a cinder-and-spatter cone 255 m high, over twice the height of any other cone on the east rift zone.  The cone was strikingly asymmetrical, because the prevailing trade winds caused most of the airborne fragments to pile up on the southwest side of the conduit.   1986–1992:  Continuous Eruption of Kupaianaha Sends Lava to the Sea   In July 1986, the vertical conduit of Pu‘u ‘O‘o ruptured, and the eruption shifted to a new vent, Kupaianaha, 3 km northeast of Pu‘u ‘O‘o.  This event marked the end of episodic high fountaining and the beginning of five-and-a-half years of nearly continuous, quiet effusion (episode 48).  A lava pond formed over the new vent, and its frequent overflows resulted in a broad, low shield that reached its maximum height of 56 m in less than a year.    After weeks of continuous eruption, the main channel exiting the pond gradually developed a roof as crust at the sides of the channel extended across the lava stream.  This was the beginning of a lava tube that would eventually extend to the ocean.  Lava tubes insulate rivers of lava from both heat and gas loss.  Flows that break out of tubes are usually pahoehoe, a type of lava more fluid than ‘a‘a.  The surface of a cooled pahoehoe flow can be flat and smooth, ropy, shelly, or undulating.   A broad field of tube-fed pahoehoe spread gradually from Kupaianaha to the ocean, 12 km to the southeast, taking three months to cover the same distance that ‘a‘a  from Pu‘u ‘O‘o traveled in less than a day.  By early November 1986, the flows were visible on the steep slope above the small community of Kapa‘ahu, and their leisurely pace was no longer reassuring.   On November 28, 1986, flows from Kupaianaha reached the ocean, cutting a swath through Kapa‘ahu and closing the coastal highway.  A few weeks later, the lava took a more easterly course and overran 14 homes on the northwest edge of Kalapana in a single day.  Fortunately for the rest of the village, this flow abruptly stagnated when the tube became blocked near the vent.   Over the next three years, lava destroyed a few homes on either side of the ever-widening flow field.  Initially, the course of pahoehoe flows was strongly influenced by topography, but, eventually, even the highest ground was inundated.  The depth of the lava increased as flows covered many areas repeatedly and the tube-fed flows grew from within, inflating as more lava was intruded under the already solid crust of the flow front.    From mid–1987 through 1989, most of the lava that erupted from Kupaianaha flowed directly to the sea.  Steam explosions at the ocean entry fragmented the lava, creating black sand that collected to form new beaches in protected bays down-current of the lava entry.  New, albeit unstable, acreage was added to the island as lava deltas built seaward over a steep submarine slope of fragmented lava.    The long-lived tube system delivering lava to the ocean began to break down in the spring of 1989, and surface flows were a common sight, particularly on the steep slope (pali) above the coastal plain.  Lava flows encroached on new territory, overrunning the Waha‘ula Visitor Center and adjoining residences in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park.    The eruption began to change in 1990, when a series of nine pauses, lasting from one to four days, interrupted the steady effusion of lava.  At the same time, the eruption entered its most destructive phase.  In March 1990, the flows turned toward Kalapana, an area cherished for its historic sites and black sand beaches.  By the end of the summer, the entire community, including a church, store, and 100 homes, lay buried under 15–25 m of lava.  In May 1990, a Federal Disaster Declaration was issued for Kalapana and all other areas previously affected by the eruption.    As the flows advanced eastward, they took to the sea, covering the palm-lined Kaimu Bay with a plain of lava that extends 300 m beyond the original shoreline.  In late 1990, a new lava tube diverted lava away from Kalapana and back into the national park, where flows again entered the ocean.    During the five-and-a-half years that Kupaianaha reigned, repeated collapses of the Pu‘u ‘O‘o conduit gradually formed a crater approximately 300 m in diameter.  A lava pond appeared sporadically at the bottom of the crater starting in 1987; after 1990 it was present most of the time.   The volume of lava erupted from Kupaianaha steadily declined in 1991.  Concurrently the level and activity of the Pu‘u ‘O‘o lava pond rose.  In November 1991, fissures opened between Pu‘u ‘O‘o and Kupaianaha and erupted for three weeks.  Kupaianaha continued to erupt during this event (episode 49), but its output was waning.  On February 7, 1992, the Kupaianaha vent was dead.   1992–1997: The Return to Pu‘u ‘O‘o   Ten days later, the eruption returned to Pu‘u ‘O‘o.  Lava erupted in low fountains along a fissure on the west flank of the massive cone.  This was the first in a series of flank vents that were active for the next five years (episodes 50–53).  As at Kupaianaha, the style of the eruption was nearly continuous, quiet effusion.   Episodes 50–53 built a lava shield 45 m high and 1 km in diameter that banked up against the western flank of Pu‘u ‘O‘o.  In November 1992, lava crossed the Chain of Craters Road in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and entered the ocean at Kamoamoa, 11 km from the vents.  Over the next month, tube-fed pahoehoe flows buried the Kamoamoa archaeological site, the National Park‘s campground and picnic area, and the black sand beach formed earlier in the eruption by flows from Kupaianaha entering the ocean farther east.  From the end of 1992 through January 1997, tubes fed lava to the ocean almost continuously, broadening the episode 50–53 flow field, which lies mostly within the National Park.    Beginning in 1993, collapse pits appeared on the west flank of Pu‘u ‘O‘o as the magma feeding the flank vents undermined that side of the cone.  Collapse pits had engulfed most of the west flank by the end of 1996.   January 1997:  Cone Collapse Heralds Fissure Eruption   On the night of January 30, 1997, Pu‘u ‘O‘o cone changed dramatically.  Magma drained from the Pu‘u ‘O‘o conduit, causing, first, the crater floor, then the west wall of the cone, to collapse.  Shortly thereafter, new fissures broke open and erupted briefly in and near Napau Crater.  The fissure eruption, designated episode 54, lasted 22 hours.     The collapse at Pu‘u ‘O‘o left a large gap in the west side of the cone.  The rubble-lined crater was now 210 m deep.   February 1997 to Present:  Eruption of Pu‘u ‘O‘o Flank Vents Resumes   Episode 54 was followed by the longest eruptive hiatus in more than 10 years.  Twenty-four days passed before episode 55 began on February 24, 1997, when lava rose through the rubble on the floor of the crater to form a new pond.  Lava erupted outside the crater a month later, when new vents opened on the west and southwest flanks of the cone.   In April 1997, a single vent on the west side of the crater replaced the active lava pond in Pu‘u ‘O‘o.  Flows from this vent intermittently ponded at the crater‘s east end.  In June 1997, the lava rose until it overtopped the gap in the west wall of Pu‘u ‘O‘o formed by the January 1997 collapse.  Lava spilled from the crater for the first time in 11 years.  Subsequent crater overflows overtopped the east crater rim and extended as far as 1.5 km downrift.  The spillovers were brief events, ending when the pond drained through conduits in the crater floor.    Tube-fed flows from the episode–55 flank vents reached the ocean in July 1997 near the eastern boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park.  Episode 55 flows have subsequently buried much of the episode–50–53-flow field.  In early 2000, flows crossed the eastern boundary of the park and encroached on private property.  During the next two years, lava overran five abandoned houses in Royal Gardens subdivision, bringing the total number of structures destroyed by this eruption to 189 by the end of May 2002.

Contents  This CD–ROM contains 100 digitized color 35-mm images of eruptions of Pu‘u ‘O‘o and Kupaianaha from 1983 to 1997, designed for use by the interested public, multimedia producers, desktop publishers, and the high-end printing industry.  The digital images are stored in the “images” folder and can be read across Macintosh, Windows, DOS, OS/2, SGI, UNIX system-based, and Linux platforms with applications that can read JPG (JPEG – Joint Photographic Experts Group format) or PCD (Kodak‘s PhotoCD (YCC) format) files.  Throughout this publication, the image numbers match the file names, figure captions, thumbnail labels, and other references.  Also included on this CD–ROM are Windows and Macintosh viewers and engines for keyword searches (Adobe Acrobat Reader with Search).  At the time of this publication, Kodak‘s policy on the distribution of color-management files is still unresolved, and so none is included on this CD–ROM.  However, using the Universal Ektachrome or Universal Kodachrome transforms found in your software will provide excellent color.  In addition to PhotoCD (PCD) files, this CD–ROM contains large (14.2”x19.5”) and small (4”x6”) screen-resolution (72 dots per inch; dpi) images in JPEG format.  These undergo downsizing and compression relative to the PhotoCD images.  Each of these resolutions is located in the following folders:    PhotoCD format (PCDs): /images/PCD/ (490 MB)  14.2”x19.5”: /images/JPG/large_screen/ (16.5 MB)  4”x6”: /images/JPG/small_screen/ (2.1 MB)      Images  This CD–ROM presents text and 100 photographs showing volcanic activity of Pu‘u ‘O‘o and Kupaianaha.  The images are presented in a variety of ways:   an “album” in Web-browser (HyperText Markup Language; HTML) format that contains brief introductory text, photographs (screen-resolution), and captions   a “book” in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format that contains detailed text, photographs (print-resolution), and captions   a “contact sheet” photograph collection in PDF format   a “slideshow” of the photographs in PDF format available for two sizes of monitors   a set of “thumbnails” of the photographs in PDF format that consist of tiny versions of each image and its image number   as individual images in folders containing Kodak PhotoCD (PCD) image-pac format and JPG format files       Album in Web-browser (HTML) Format  An “album” is provided here as an HTML file.  Each image is first presented as a 4”x6” image.  Clicking on any 4”x6” image will bring up a larger version (14” wide or 10” high).  Use your browser‘s “Back” button to return to the album.  The color “palate” contains 16.7 million colors.           View the Web-browser album  (album.html; 85 KB with links to 18.6 MB of image files)   Accessibility   The content within this publication is presented in several formats.  The HTML forms (index.html; this file, and album.html) are presented with alternative text to make them fully accessible using assistive technology such as screen readers; they comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 508.  As the PDF forms (DDS-80.pdf, contact_sheet.pdf, thumbnails.pdf, and the two slideshow PDFs) contain the same images and the same text, it was unnecessary to “tag” them for accessibility.

GX001-71-9063377	U.S. Geological Survey    Fact Sheet 165-97    Online Version 1.1         Living With Volcanic Risk in the Cascades                             The Cascade          Range of the Pacific Northwest has more than a dozen potentially active          volcanoes. Cascade volcanoes tend to erupt explosively, and on average          two eruptions occur per century—the most recent were at Mount St.          Helens, Washington (1980–86), and Lassen Peak, California (1914–17).          To help protect the Pacific Northwest’s rapidly expanding population,          USGS scientists at the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington,          monitor and assess the hazards posed by the region’s volcanoes.                              On May 18, 1980, after    2 months of earthquakes and minor eruptions, Mount St. Helens, Washington, exploded    in one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions of the 20th century. Although    less than 0.1 cubic mile of molten rock (magma) was erupted, 57 people died,    and damage exceeded $1 billion. Fortunately, most people in the area were able    to evacuate safely before the eruption because public officials had been alerted    to the danger by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and other scientists. As early    as 1975, USGS researchers had warned that Mount St. Helens might soon erupt.    Coming more than 60 years after the last eruption in the Cascades (Lassen Peak),    the explosion of St. Helens was a spectacular reminder that the millions of    residents of the Pacific Northwest share the region with live volcanoes.        VOLCANOES OF THE CASCADES      The volcanoes of the Cascade    Range, which stretches from northern California into British Columbia, have    produced more than 100 eruptions, most of them explosive, in just the past few    thousand years. However, individual Cascade volcanoes can lie dormant for many    centuries between eruptions, and the great risk posed by volcanic activity inregion    is therefore not always apparent.      When Cascade volcanoes    do erupt, high-speed avalanches of hot ash and rock pyroclastic flows), lava    flows, and landslides can devastate areas 10 or more miles away; and huge mudflows    of volcanic ash and debris, called lahars, can inundate valleys more than 50    miles downstream. Falling ash from explosive eruptions can disrupt human activities    hundreds of miles downwind, and drifting clouds of fine ash can cause severe    damage to jet aircraft even thousands of miles away.                                                                                       The more            than 1 million residents of the Seattle-Tacoma, Washington, area live            in the shadow of 14,411-foot-high Mount Rainier, the tallest volcano            in the United States outside of Alaska. Several communities near the            volcano, built on the deposits of giant lahars of volcanic ash and debris            that are less than 1,200 years old, are at risk from similar future            lahars. Inset photograph shows a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientist            monitoring the volcano for signs of subtle ground movement that might            lead to an eruption or landslide. Photos by Lyn Topinka, USGS.                    Because the      population of the Pacific Northwest is rapidly expanding, the volcanoes of      the Cascade Range in Washington, Oregon, and northern California are some      of the most dangerous in the United States.          Washington          Mount Baker  erupted in the mid-1800s for the first time in several    thousand years. Activity at steam vents (fumaroles) in Sherman Crater, near    the volcano’s summit, increased in 1975 and is still vigorous, but there    is no evidence that an eruption is imminent.     Glacier Peak  has erupted at least six times in the past 4,000 years.    About 13,000 years ago, an especially powerful series of eruptions deposited    volcanic ash at least as far away as Wyoming.     Mount Rainier  has produced at least four eruptions and numerous lahars    in the past 4,000 years. It is capped by more glacier ice than the rest of the    Cascade volcanoes combined, and parts of Rainier’s steep slopes have been    weakened by hot, acidic volcanic gases and water. These factors make this volcano    especially prone to landslides and lahars.     Mount St. Helens  is the most frequently active volcano in the Cascades.    During the past 4,000 years, it has produced many lahars and a wide variety    of eruptive activity, from relatively quiet outflows of lava to explosive eruptions    much larger than that of May 18, 1980.     Mount Adams  has produced few eruptions during the past several thousand    years. This volcano’s most recent activity was a series of small eruptions    about 1,000 years ago.          Oregon         Mount Hood  last erupted about 200 years ago, producing pyroclastic    flows, lahars, and a prominent lava dome (Crater Rock) near the volcano’s    summit. Most recently, a series of steam blasts occurred between 1856 and 1865.     Mount Jefferson  last erupted more than 20,000 years ago. However, eruptions    nearby have produced several lava flows and small volcanic cones in the past    10,000 years.     Three Sisters Volcanic Center  in central Oregon includes five large    volcanoes—North Sister, Middle Sister, South Sister, Broken Top, and Mount    Bachelor. About 2,000 years ago, eruptions occurred on South Sister, as well    as from several small volcanoes north of North Sister. Since 1997, a broad area    centered 3 miles west of South Sister has domed upward by more than 5 inches.    Scientists think that this doming reflects the ongoing accumulation of magma    at a depth of 3 to 4 miles. The outcome of this activity is uncertain, but there    is no evidence that an eruption is imminent. The USGS and its partners have    increased monitoring efforts in the area to detect any changes that might warrant    more concern.     Newberry Volcano , a broad shield covering more than 500 square miles,    is capped by Newberry Crater, a large volcanic depression (caldera) 5 miles    across. Its most recent eruption was about 1,300 years ago.     Crater Lake  occupies a 6-mile-wide caldera formed 7,700 years ago when    the summit of an ancient volcano (referred to as Mount Mazama) collapsed during    a huge explosive eruption. More than 10 cubic miles of magma was erupted, 10    times as much as in any other eruption in the Cascades during the past 10,000    years. Smaller eruptions ending about 5,000 years ago formed Wizard Island and    several submerged cones and lava domes on the lake floor.          Northern California         Medicine Lake Volcano , a broad shield capped by a 4- by 7-mile-wide    caldera, has erupted at least eight times in the past 4,000 years, most recently    about 900 years ago. With a volume of more than 130 cubic miles, it is the largest    volcano in the Cascades.     Mount Shasta  has been the most active volcano in California during    the past 4,000 years, second in the entire Cascade Range to Mount St. Helens.    During that time, Shasta has erupted on average about once every 300 years,    producing many pyroclastic flows and lahars.    probably last erupted in 1786.     Lassen Volcanic Field , including Lassen Peak, is the southernmost volcanic    center in the Cascades. The most recent volcanic eruptions in California occurred    at Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1917. An explosive eruption on May 22, 1915, produced    a large pyroclastic flow, lahars, and ash that fell as far away as Elko, Nevada,    300 miles to the east.                                                                          Of the            13 potentially active volcanoes in the Cascade Range of the Pacific            Northwest, 11 have erupted in the past 4,000 years, and 7 in just the            past 200 years. More than 100 eruptions, most of which were explosive,            have occurred in the past 4,000 years, making the volcanoes of the Cascade            Range some of the most hazardous in the United States. Each eruption            symbol in the diagram represents from one to several dozen eruptions            closely  spaced            in time. Eruptions have also occurred from other vents (not shown) scattered            throughout the Cascade Range, especially in central Oregon and southwestern            Washington.                      REDUCING THE RISK FROM CASCADES VOLCANOES        After the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Congress provided increased funding    that enabled the USGS to establish a volcano observatory for the Cascade Range.    Located in Vancouver, Washington, the David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory    (CVO) was named for a USGS scientist killed at a forward observation post by    the May 18, 1980, eruption.    Scientists at CVO quickly recognized that was not economically feasible to    fully monitor all potentially active Cascade volcanoes. To address this and    similar problems elsewhere in the United States and abroad, the USGS developed    a suite of portable volcano-monitoring instruments—essentially, a portable    volcano observatory. In the Pacific Northwest, when regional networks of earthquake    sensors, operated in cooperation with the University Washington’s Pacific    Northwest Seismograph Network, detect unusual seismic activity at volcano, CVO    staff will rapidly deploy this portable equipment to evaluate the hazard and,    if needed, provide timely warnings to local officials and the public.    CVO also uses remote sensing as an early-detection tool. A technique called    interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) allows scientists to measure    subtle movements of the ground surface, using radar images obtained by Earth-orbiting    satellites. The current ground doming at Three Sisters was first detected using    this technique.   CVO was able to issue accurate warnings of the small eruptions that occurred    until 1986 at Mount St. Helens. Observatory scientists also have conducted many    new studies of the past geologic behavior of Cascade volcanoes. These studies    allow assessments of long-term hazards (including lahars and landslides, which    can occur even when a volcano is not erupting) and provide the data for hazard-zone    maps that enable communities to make wise land-use-planning decisions and to    prepare emergency-response plans.    The work of CVO scientists is helping residents of the Pacific Northwest live    with volcanic risk and plan for volcano emergencies. This work is only part    of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program’s ongoing efforts to protect people’s    lives and property in all of the volcanic regions of the United States, including    the Pacific Northwest, eastern California, Wyoming, Alaska, and Hawaii.

These volcanoes and Mount Hood to the south in Oregon   are part of the Cascade Range, a volcanic arc that stretches from southwestern   British Columbia to northern California.         Although there are thousands of small basaltic or basaltic-andesitic   volcanoes in the Cascade Range, the 13 major composite volcanic centers in the   U.S., all part of the range, have been the focus of most hazards concerns.   During the past 12,000 years, these volcanoes have produced more than 200   eruptions that have generated tephra (ejected material), lava flows, and lahars   (volcanic debris flows) and debris avalanches. It is important to note that   other enormous debris avalanches and lahars may have been caused by intrusions   of magma (not eruptions) or steam explosions at the volcanoes or by local or   regional earthquakes because these flowage events do not correlate with known   tephra layers.         All Washington volcanoes except Mount Adams have erupted within the last 250   years (see table below). However, the volcanoes do not erupt at regular intervals, thus   making it difficult to forecast when a given volcano might come to life again.   Although worldwide the risks from volcanoes are significantly lower than risks   from earthquakes and landslides, the relatively long recurrence interval for   volcanic hazards (decades to several centuries) combined with their great   potential for destruction make them particularly insidious.

GX005-41-8213696	Volcanic History Questions                                               How often do volcanic eruptions occur at Yellowstone?                             Three extremely large explosive eruptions have occurred         at Yellowstone in the past 2.1 million years with a         recurrence interval of about 600,000 to 800,000 years.         More frequent eruptions of           basalt  and           rhyolite  lava flows have occurred before and after         the large caldera-forming events. For example, scientists         have identified about 30 different rhyolite lava flows         that erupted after the most recent caldera eruptions,         about 640,000 years ago, from vents inside the caldera.         The most recent was about 70,000 years ago. Many of these         eruptions were separated in time by several tens of         thousandsof years. Because the evidence of earlier         eruptions may have been either buried or destroyed, we do         not really know how often the volcano has actually         erupted.                                              How many caldera-forming eruptions have occurred from the       long-lived hotspot that is currently beneath Yellowstone?                             Many eruptive units found along the path of the         Yellowstone hotspot have been dated, but only a few of         them represent large caldera-forming eruptions. At least         five volcanic fields centered on large caldera complexes         have been identified. Some of these caldera complexes         erupted climatically more than once; probably 15 to 20         caldera-forming eruptions have occurred along the hotspot         as it  left a         trail  from western Idaho to Yellowstone within the         past 16.5 million years.                                              How many giant eruptions have occurred in the Yellowstone       National Park region and how large were they?                             Volcanic activity began in the Yellowstone National Park         region a little before about 2 million years ago. Molten         rock (          magma ) rising from deep within the Earth produced         three cataclysmic eruptions more powerful than any in the         world's recorded history. The first caldera-forming         eruption occurred about 2.1 million years ago. The         eruptive blast removed so much magma from its subsurface         storage reservoir that the ground above it collapsed into         the magma chamber and left a gigantic depression in the         ground- a hole larger than the state of Rhode Island. The         huge crater, known as a           caldera , measured as much as 80 kilometers long, 65         kilometers wide, and hundreds of meters deep, extending         from outside of Yellowstone National Park into the         central area of the Park ( Figure 1 ).                         Later, activity shifted to a smaller region within the         Island Park area of eastern Idaho, just southwest of         Yellowstone National Park, and produced another large         caldera-forming eruption 1.3 million years ago.         Subsequent activity has been focused within the area of         the National Park, and another huge eruption 640,000         years ago formed the Yellowstone caldera as we now see         it.                         The three caldera-forming eruptions, respectively, were         about 2,500, 280, and 1,000 times larger than the May 18,         1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens in Washington State.         Together, the three catastrophic eruptions expelled         enough ash and lava to fill the Grand Canyon.                         In addition to the three climactic eruptions, activity         associated with each of the three caldera cycles produced         dozens or even hundreds of smaller eruptions that         produced both lava and           pyroclastic  materials.                                              How large were the giant eruptions in the Yellowstone       National Park region in comparison to other large historic       eruptions?                              Figure 2          shows that the three largest Yellowstone eruptions         emitted much more material than the eruptions of Mount         St. Helens (1980), Mount Pinatubo (1991), Krakatau         (1883), Mount Mazama (7,600 years ago), and Tambora         (1815).                                              When was the last time there was volcanism at Yellowstone?                             The most recent volcanic activity consisted of           rhyolitic  lava flows that erupted approximately         70,000 years ago. The largest of these flows formed the         Pitchstone Plateau in southwestern Yellowstone National         Park.                                              How much volcanic activity has there been at Yellowstone       since the most recent giant eruption?                             Since the most recent giant caldera-forming eruption,         640,000 years ago, at least 30 smaller but still         destructive volcanic eruptions have occurred at         Yellowstone. Some of the eruptions were approximately the         size of the devastating 1991 Pinatubo eruption in the         Philippines, and several were much larger.                                              What was the extent of ash deposition from the largest       Yellowstone eruptions?                             During the three giant caldera-forming eruptions that         occurred between 2.1 million and 640,000 years ago, tiny         particles of volcanic debris ( volcanic         ash ) covered much of the western half of North         America, likely a third of a meter deep several hundred         kilometers from Yellowstone and several centimeters thick         farther away ( Figure 3 ). Wind carried sulfur         aerosol and the lightest ash particles around the planet         and likely caused a notable decrease in temperatures         around the globe.                                     |  Home      |  Current Activity      |  Volcanic History      |  Products & Refs.      |  Photogallery      |  FAQs      |  About       YVO  |                U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey,  Menlo Park,  California , USA   URL  http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/faqs2.html  Contact:  Yellowstone  Web Team     |  USGS  Privacy Statement  |  USGS  Disclaimer  |   Last modification: Friday, 07-Feb-2003 15:07:04 EST (GCM)

In the mid-1800's, local  residents reported minor explosive activity, but since that time the volcano has  been quiet. Someday, however, Mount Hood will erupt again. What will those  eruptions be like and how will they affect us? Scientists from the U.S.  Geological Survey (USGS) are studying the volcano's past eruptive behavior to  better anticipate and prepare for future eruptive activity.                                                                                               Mount Hood from Portland, Oregon.  When Mount Hood next erupts,          Portland could be affected by light ashfalls similar to those it experienced during the 1980         eruptions of Mount St. Helens. The city will not be directly affected by lava flows,         pyroclastic flows, or lahars, but regional transportation and water supplies could be disrupted.         (Photo by David Wieprecht, USGS)                                    PAST ERUPTIVE BEHAVIOR        Mount Hood is more than 500,000 years old. The volcano has grown in fits  and starts, with decades to centuries of frequent eruptions separated by quiet  periods lasting from centuries to more than 10,000 years. In the recent past,  Mount Hood has had two significant eruptive periods, one about 1,500 years ago  and the other about 200 years ago.                                                   Subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate controls the distribution         of earthquakes and volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest.  Mount Hood is just one of several         recently active, major volcanic centers in the Cascade Range.                              Unlike its neighbor to the north, Mount St. Helens, Mount Hood does not  have a history of violent explosive eruptions. Instead,   lava flows   (see  Volcano Hazards graphic for definitions of bold terms), rarely traveling more than 6 to 8 miles  from their source, have built up the flanks of the volcano one sector at a time.  Sometimes, instead of flowing slowly downhill, lava piles up over its vent  forming a   lava dome  many hundreds of feet high. On the steep upper slopes of  Mount Hood, growing lava domes have repeatedly collapsed to form extremely hot,  fast-moving   pyroclastic flows . Few of these pyroclastic flows have traveled more  than 8 miles. But because they are extremely hot, such flows can melt  significant quantities of snow and ice to produce   lahars   that flow down river  valleys, often far beyond the flanks of the volcano. Over the past 30,000 years,  growth and collapse of lava domes and generation of lahars have dominated Mount  Hood's eruptive activity.                                                         Throughout Mount Hood's history, rapid landslides, called   debris  avalanches , of various sizes have occurred. The largest ones removed the summit  and sizable parts of the volcano's flanks and formed lahars that flowed to the  Columbia River. Large debris avalanches occur infrequently and are usually  triggered by eruptive activity. But small ones not associated with eruptive  activity occur more frequently. Small avalanches can occur when rocks, altered  and weakened by acidic volcanic fluids or by weathering, such as freezing and  thawing, fail spontaneously.                                                                                                         A River Transformed                       In 1806, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark named a river on the south side of the Columbia           River gorge the Quicksand River. Their description of a wide, shallow river with a bed formed          entirely of quicksand, bears little resemblance to the narrow, moderately deep river we call           today the Sandy River. What happened? The answer lay 50 miles away at Mount Hood. An eruption in           the 1790's caused a tremendous amount of volcanic rock and sand to enter the Sandy River drainage.           That sediment was still being flushed downstream when Lewis and Clark saw and named the river.           Since 1806, the river has removed the excess sediment from its channel. The Toutle River in           southwest Washington was similarly affected by the 1980 eruptions of Mount St. Helens. A           sediment-retention dam was built in the late 1980's to trap sediment and ease flooding in           the lower Toutle River below the dam.                                                   HAZARDS CAN OCCUR EVEN WITHOUT ERUPTIVE ACTIVITY      Lahars are often associated with eruptive activity, but they can also be  generated by rapid erosion of loose rock during heavy rains or by sudden  outbursts of glacial water. On Christmas Day 1980, an intense rainstorm rapidly  melted snow and triggered a small landslide in fragmental debris in upper  Polallie Creek. The resulting lahar moved downvalley at 25 to 35 miles per hour.  At the mouth of Polallie Creek, the lahar spread out, killing a camper and  temporarily damming the East Fork Hood River. Flooding after failure of this  temporary dam destroyed 5 miles of highway, three bridges, and a state parkat a  cost of at least $13 million. Small lahars such as this occur every few years at  Mount Hood, but few have been as destructive.        PAST CATASTROPIC EVENTS      Two past eruptions at Mount Hood provide perspective on the impact of  future large events. Both were associated with eruptive activity that triggered   debris avalanches and were accompanied by lava extrusion, pyroclastic flows,   and lahars. One represents a truly catastrophic event.    About 100,000 years ago, a large portion of the volcano's north flank and  summit collapsed. The resulting debris avalanche transformed into a lahar that  swept down the Hood River valley. At the river's mouth, where the town of Hood  River now stands, the lahar was 400 feet deep. The lahar crossed the Columbia  River and surged up the White Salmon River valley on the Washington side. Since  that time lava has filled in the scar left by the debris avalanche.                                                          Geologist examining 100,000-year-old lahar deposit exposed along Underwood Hill         Road, near the mouth of the White Salmon River in Washington. The lahar, derived         from a large debris avalanche off the north side of Mount Hood, flowed down the         Hood River, crossed the Columbia River, and traveled several miles up the White         Salmon River before stopping.  Here, the deposit is about 40 feet thick and about         300 feet above present river level.  (Photo by William Scott, USGS)                                On the south side of the volcano, the scar from a 1,500-year-old debris  avalanche is still visible, forming the amphitheater around Crater Rock. A lahar  formed by this event traveled the length of the Sandy River valley, depositing  boulders as large as 8 feet in diameter, 30 feet above present river level where  the towns of Wemme and Wildwood now stand. The lahar spread out over the delta  at the mouth of the Sandy River and pushed the Columbia River to the north. This  event, although large by Mount Hood's standards, was only about one-tenth the  size of the 100,000-year-old event.    Mount Hood's next eruption is much more likely to be smaller than or  similar in size to the 1,500-year-old event. An eruption similar in size to the  100,000-year-old event, although possible, is much less likely.                                                                              The two faces of Mount Hood.  In the photo of the south flank taken from         Trillium Lake, the dashed line marks the steep scarp above Crater Rock formed         by a landslide 1,500 years ago.  Dome growth and collapse from Crater Rock         during the last two eruptive episodes (1,500 and 200 years ago) sent numerous         pyroclastic flows down the south flank, resulting in the smooth south-facing         slope.  On the north flank, lack of recent volcanic activity has preserved the         deeply carved glacial landscape on this side of the mountain.  In its long         history, Mount Hood has experienced numerous ice ages, each lasting for         thousands of years, when glaciers were more extensive than today.  During the         last one, which ended about 15,000 years ago, glaciers extended 4 to 5 miles         beyond their present limits.  (Photos by William Scott, USGS)                                    MOUNT HOOD TODAY      Today Mount Hood shows no signs of imminent volcanic activity, but hot  steam vents, or fumaroles, near Crater Rock attest to heat below. On clear,  cold, windless days, a steam plume is often seen rising from the fumaroles.  Visitors to Mount Hood frequently smell the ""rotten egg"" odor of the  fumarole gas, whose composition indicates that magma lies a few miles below the  summit.                THE NEXT ERUPTION OF MOUNT HOOD                 Scientists expect the next eruption to consist of small explosions and the growth        and collapse of lava domes, generating pyroclastic flows, ash clouds, and lahars.        Lahars pose the greatest hazard because more people live downstream in lahar-prone        river valleys than live on the volcano's flanks. Thus, it is important to know where        one lives, works, and plays in relation to Mount Hood's hazard zones.                                                      Mount Hoods last major eruption occurred 200 years ago and consisted of growth and collapse         of a lava dome that sent numerous pyroclastic flows down the south and west flanks.  Crater Rock         (above) is the remnant of that dome.  The left photo shows a pyroclastic flow during the August 7,         1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens.  A billowing ash cloud rises from the pyroclastic flow.          Future pyroclastic flows from Mount Hood could devastate areas on the flanks of the volcano, and fallout of ash from the ash cloud could disrupt transportation and prove a nuisance to residents downwind.  (Photos by  Peter Lipman and David        Wieprecht, USGS)                                                                                                                 House partly buried by lahars from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.  Note the high mud line on the house and large amounts of woody debris carried by the lahars. (Photo by Lyn Topinka, USGS)                                            Hazardous Areas                Hazard zones    shown on the map were determined on the basis of distance from the volcano,    vent location, and type of hazardous events. Proximal hazard zones ( P )    are areas subject to rapidly moving debris avalanches, pyroclastic flows, and    lahars that can reach the hazard boundary in less than 30 minutes, as well as    to slow-moving lava flows. Areas within proximal hazard zones should be evacuated    before an eruption begins, because there is little time to get people out of    harm's way once an eruption starts. Most pyroclastic flows, lava flows, and    debris avalanches will stop within the proximal hazard zone, but lahars can    travel much farther.           Distal hazard zones ( D ) are areas adjacent to rivers that are pathways for lahars. Estimated        travel time for lahars to reach these zones is more than 30 minutes, which may allow        individuals time to move to higher ground and greater safety if given warning. Shown are        inundation areas for lahars of a size similar to lahars that swept through the Sandy River        1,500 year ago. Smaller or larger lahars will affect smaller or larger areas, respectively.        Lahars could affect transportation corridors by damaging or destroying bridges and roads.        Water from the Bull Run Watershed, vital to Portland, is transported in pipes that cross        distal hazard zones along the Sandy River.         Proximal and distal hazard zones are subdivided into zones   A  and         B   on the basis of the vent        location during the next eruption. During the past two eruptive episodes, the vent was located        near Crater Rock. Scientists anticipate that the vent for the next eruption will most likely        be in the same area. Thus, areas within hazard zones   PA  and   DA  have a higher probability of        being affected during the next eruption than do areas within hazard zones   PB  and        DB , which        reflect a vent located on the volcano's west, north, or east flank.         During and after an eruption, large amounts of sediment could be carried by rivers and        discharged into the Columbia River. This sediment could narrow the Columbia's channel,        forcing it to the north and potentially causing bank erosion along the river's north bank.                                                                                        Simplified volcano-hazards-zonation map for Mount Hood, Oregon.  For more information on         hazard zones see text or for a more detailed map and description see Scott and others,         1997,           Volcano Hazards in the Mount Hood Region, Oregon, U.S. Geological Survey Open-File         Report 97-89.                                                  Larger version of Hazards Map          Tephra Hazards                 Mount Hood does not have a history of large explosive eruptions. Therefore, it is unlikely        that communities downwind (typically east of the volcano) will receive tephra accumulations        thick enough to collapse roofs. However, even minor amounts of tephra can damage machinery        and electronic equipment or make driving hazardous. Ash clouds from small explosions or        from pyroclastic flows can reach tens of thousands of feet in altitude, endangering        jet aircraft by causing engine failure. Minor amounts of tephra can make breathing difficult        for those with respiratory problems, the elderly, and infants. For most residents, however,        tephra will be a nuisance and can be mitigated by such actions as shutting down and covering        equipment, frequently replacing air filters in machinery, wearing dust masks, and avoiding        unnecessary travel.        MONITORING FOR THE NEXT ERUPTION      Renewed activity at most volcanoes begins with increasing numbers of  earthquakes beneath the volcano as magma moves towards the surface. Since 1977  the University of Washington's Geophysics Program and the USGS have continuously  monitored earthquakes at Mount Hood. Typically, one to three small earthquake  swarms (tens to more than one hundred earthquakes lasting 2 to 5 days) occur  every year. What scientists are looking for as a sign of renewed activity is for  a swarm to persist, for the number of earthquakes to increase dramatically, or  for the depths of earthquakes to become shallower. Such signs of reawakening  might also be accompanied by changes in composition or temperature of fumarole  gases, or by deformation of the volcano's flanks.    Scientists can generally detect when a volcano becomes  ""restless,"" thereby providing some warning to officials and the  public. But they cannot say precisely when an eruption will begin, how big it  will be, or how long it will last. Thus, we will all have to confront many  uncertainties when Mount Hood reawakens. Recent eruptions around the world  reveal that lava-dome eruptions, like those typical of Mount Hood, can begin  after weeks to months of restlessness, last for time periods of months to years,  and generate tens to hundreds of pyroclastic flows and lahars of varying size.  Unfortunately, the end of an eruption doesn't always mean the end of  eruption-related problems. New deposits of rock debris on the volcano's slopes  and in river valleys can be reworked to form lahars for many years after an  eruption ends.                 PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE         Scientists do not know when Mount Hood will erupt again or whether it will erupt in our        lifetimes, but, as Mount St. Helens taught us, it is best to be prepared.  Scientists        continuously monitor Mount Hood for signs of unrest and are in communication with responsible        local, State, and Federal agencies. Individuals too can prepare by doing the following:                   Learn about the volcano hazards that could affect your community and determine whether you         live, work, or go to school in a volcano hazard zone.           Plan what you and your family will do if a hazardous volcanic event occurs.            Participate in helping your community be prepared.                         A few moments spent now could help keep the next eruption of Mount Hood from becoming a        disaster for you, your family, and your community.             By             Cynthia A.

GX001-79-8294225	"U.S.    Geological Survey Fact Sheet 092-02 Online Version 1.0        Mount Mazama and Crater Lake: Growth and Destruction of a Cascade Volcano               For more than 100 years, scientists have sought to      unravel the remarkable story of Crater Lake’s formation.  Before Crater Lake came into existence, a cluster of volcanoes       dominated the landscape.  This cluster, called Mount Mazama (for the Portland, Oregon, climbing club the Mazamas), was       destroyed during an enormous explosive eruption 7,700 years ago.  So much molten rock was expelled that the summit area       collapsed during the eruption to form a large volcanic depression, or caldera.  Subsequent smaller eruptions occurred as       water began to fill the caldera to eventually form the deepest lake in the United States.  Decades of detailed       scientific studies of Mount Mazama and new maps of the floor of Crater Lake reveal stunning details of the volcano’s       eruptive history and identify potential hazards from future eruptions and earthquakes.                                           The cataclysmic eruption of Mount Mazama 7,700 years      ago began with a towering column of pumice and ash, as depicted in this painting by Paul Rockwood (image courtesy       of Crater Lake Natural History Association).                                          After the collapse of the summit of the volcano,      the caldera filled with water to form Crater Lake  (Photo by Willie Scott, USGS).           When Clarence Dutton of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) visited  Crater Lake, Oregon in 1886, he was awestruck by its amazing beauty: “as the visitor reaches the brink of the cliff, he  suddenly sees below him an expanse of ultramarine blue of a richness and intensity which he has probably never seen  before, and will not be likely to see again.”  He spent nearly a month sounding the depths of the lake from a rowboat,  wondering at the forces that could create such a magnificent landscape.  In the more than 100 years since Dutton’s first  survey, scientists have steadily unraveled the mystery of the formation of Crater Lake and with it the demise of  Mount Mazama.      Mount Mazama          Mount Mazama was formed over a period of nearly half a million years by  a succession of overlapping volcanoes.  The first eruptions about 420,000 years ago built Mount Scott, located just east of   Crater Lake.  Over the next several hundred thousand years, Mount Scott and other nearby volcanoes became extinct, while new   volcanoes grew to the west.  Layers of lava flows from these volcanoes are visible in the caldera walls and in landmarks   along the south rim of Crater Lake, including Applegate and Garfield Peaks.  During the growth of Mount Mazama, glaciers   repeatedly carved out classic U-shaped valleys.  Some were filled with lava from later eruptions, while others, such as Kerr   Notch and Sun Notch, were not.     By about 30,000 years ago, Mount Mazama began to generate increasingly  explosive eruptions that were followed by thick flows of silica-rich lava, an outward sign of the slow accumulation of a large  volume of highly explosive magma deep beneath the volcano. Grouse Hill and Redcloud Cliff are thick lava flows erupted between  30,000 and 25,000 years ago.  Another such eruption about 7,900 years ago formed a white layer of pumice and ash and the thick  lava flow of  Llao Rock.  Within 200 years of the eruption at Llao Rock, another thick lava flow erupted near present-day  Cleetwood Cove.  These eruptions reached a peak 7,700 years ago in the largest explosive eruption in the Cascades during the  past 1 million years.          Crater       Walls Tell the Story of Mount Mazama                                                            The earliest eruptions about 420,000        years ago built Mount Scott (photo by Ed Klimasauskas, USGS).                                After the eruptions at Mount Scott, a series of successively        younger overlapping volcanoes grew to the west.  Landmarks along the south rim of Crater Lake         caldera, such as Garfield Peak,        are made up of lava flows erupted from these volcanoes over several hundred thousand         years (photo by Ed Klimasauskas, USGS).                               400,000 year-old lava flows make up        Phantom Ship, the oldest rocks exposed above lake level within the caldera         (photo by Ed Klimasauskas, USGS).                              Glaciers carved classic U-shaped        valleys on the flanks of Mount Mazama during ice ages, including the valleys of Sun Notch and Kerr         Notch (photo by Ed Klimasauskas, USGS).                              Beginning about 30,000        years ago, eruptions of a silica-rich magma called rhyodacite signaled the beginning of explosive eruptions that would lead        to the cataclysmic eruption.  During one such eruption about 7,900 years ago, the white layer of pumice and ash beneath Llao        Rock was formed.  After the explosive phase ended, the thick lava flow of Llao Rock oozed over the pumice and         ash (photo by Ed Klimasauskas, USGS).                              A thick layer of pumice and ash        from the eruption that formed Crater Lake caldera blankets much of the caldera rim.  Other layers of pumice and ash, like        the orange Pumice Castle (circled), are deposits from older, smaller explosive         eruptions (photo by Ed Klimasauskas, USGS).                          Mount Mazama’s Final Eruption    The cataclysmic eruption of Mount Mazama 7,700 years ago started from a  single vent on the northeast side of the volcano as a towering column of pumice and ash that reached some 30 miles (50 km)  high.  Winds carried the ash across much of the Pacific Northwest and parts of southern Canada.  So much magma erupted that  the volcano began to collapse in on itself.  As the summit collapsed, circular cracks opened up around the peak.  More magma  erupted through these cracks to race down the slopes as pyroclastic flows.  Deposits from these flows partially filled the  valleys around Mount Mazama with up to 300 feet (100 m) of pumice and ash.  As more magma was erupted, the collapse progressed  until the dust settled to reveal a volcanic depression, called a caldera, 5 miles (8 km) in diameter and one mile (1.6 km)  deep.         Crater Lake          Soon after the cataclysmic eruption, eruptions from new vents within the  caldera built the base of Wizard Island and the central platform.  As eruptions continued, rain and snowmelt also began to  fill the caldera.  For the next few hundred years, eruptions from these new vents kept pace above the rising water level.  Lava flowed into the deepening lake, creating benches on the flanks of the growing cones that tell scientists how deep the  lake was during these eruptions.  One set of eruptions from a crater on the west edge of the central platform formed lava  tubes or channels that sent lava far out onto the caldera floor.     Later eruptions from a vent in the northern part of the caldera, just south of present-day Cleetwood Cove, built Merriam Cone.   The erupting Merriam Cone probably never reached the lake surface.  The ever-deepening lake eventually drowned the central   platform volcano as well.  Only Wizard Island managed to grow high enough to stay above the waterline.  The last eruptions   at Wizard Island took place when the lake was about 260 feet (80 m) lower than today.  All of this activity occurred within   750 years after the cataclysmic eruption.  The water level continued to rise until reaching near present-day levels, where   it encountered a thick layer of porous deposits in the northeast caldera wall.  These deposits stabilize lake levels like   an overflow drain in a bathtub.          Sometime after these eruptions, the Chaski Bay landslide, the top of which is still visible above the southern shore of Crater  Lake, slumped into the caldera and ran up onto the edge of the central platform.  Other landslides within the caldera were  deflected by the base of Wizard Island and the central platform, burying explosion craters and other features on the lake  floor with even more debris.     The last known eruption at Crater Lake occurred when a small lava dome erupted under water on the east flank of the base of  Wizard Island about 4,800 years ago.  Since that time, the volcano has remained quiet, allowing as much as 100 feet (30 m) of  sediment to accumulate on the lake bottom.                              Cataclysmic eruption to       present.         Eruptions of ash and pumice:  The cataclysmic        eruption started from a vent on the northeast side of the volcano as a towering column of ash, with pyroclastic flows        spreading to the northeast.          Caldera collapse:   As more magma was erupted, cracks opened up around the summit, which began to collapse.         Fountains of pumice and ash surrounded the collapsing summit, and pyroclastic flows raced down all sides of the volcano.          Steam explosions:  When the dust had settled, the new caldera was 5 miles (8 km) in diameter and 1 mile (1.6 km)        deep.  Ground water interacted with hot deposits causing explosions of steam and ash.          Today:  In the first few hundred years after the cataclysmic eruption, renewed eruptions built Wizard Island,        Merriam Cone, and the central platform.  Water filled the new caldera to form the deepest lake in the United States.         Figure modified from  diagrams on back of 1988 USGS map “Crater Lake National Park and Vicinity, Oregon.”                The Future    The long history of volcanic activity at Crater Lake suggests strongly that this  volcanic center will erupt again.  The most  recent eruptions occurred on the lake floor in the western part of the caldera.  Future eruptions are more likely to occur in  the same area than farther east.  Interaction of magma and lake water at shallow levels (less than 100 feet or a few tens of  meters) could generate explosions that throw large rocks and ash out beyond the caldera walls.  The largest explosions could  produce pyroclastic surges, hot, rapidly moving clouds of gas and ash, which could move out a few miles from vents along the  margin of the lake.  Eruptions in deeper water are less likely to be explosive or affect areas around the rim.  An eruption  similar to the one 7,700 years ago is unlikely because large volumes of magma are not available to cause such an eruption.      Landslides from the caldera walls can cause waves that flood shoreline areas, but one that could cause overtopping or failure  of the caldera walls and catastrophic draining of Crater Lake is unlikely.  At its lowest point, the caldera rim is more than  500 feet (165 m) above the lake level.  Only major volcanic activity could cause the caldera walls to fail and result in  flooding of lowland areas below Crater Lake.     Crater Lake lies within a region where the Earth’s crust is being gradually stretched.  The faults that accommodate this  extension could produce damaging earthquakes in Crater Lake National Park today.  The West Klamath Lake fault zone consists  of numerous faults, one of which passes 1/2 mile west of Rim Village.  Although earthquakes as large as magnitude 7.0 are  possible, scientists believe that they occur only about once every 3,000 to 10,000 years. Such earthquakes could cause  landslides large enough to generate dangerous waves on Crater Lake.  Smaller earthquakes are much more likely, but they are  unlikely to trigger large landslides.    Probing the Depths    For more than 100 years, scientists have marveled at Crater Lake’s  great depth and sought to unravel the mysteries hidden beneath its surface.  Clarence Dutton of the USGS led the first  expedition to determine the depth of the lake in 1886.  With a lead weight and piano wire, Dutton’s party made 168 soundings  from a rowboat and reported a maximum depth of 1,996 feet (608 m).  The National Park Service made additional soundings of  this type between 1938 and 1940.     It wasn’t until the advent of sonar that the nature of the caldera beneath the lake became clearer.  In 1959, the US Coast  and Geodetic Survey obtained more than 4,000 echo soundings and provided a more accurate estimate of the maximum depth of  Crater Lake – 1,932 feet (589 m).  Contours of these data revealed the principal features on the floor of Crater Lake – the  central platform, Merriam Cone, a small lava dome on the east side of Wizard Island, and the Chaski Bay landslide – for the  first time.  About the same time, Crater Lake ranger-naturalist C. Hans Nelson collected dredge samples that showed a variety  of post-7,700-year eruptive activity.  In 1979, Nelson returned to the lake as a USGS marine geologist and used acoustic  imaging techniques (like making a CAT scan) of the lake floor to discover that as much as 250 feet (75 m) of sediment had  accumulated since caldera collapse.  Nelson’s study found that beneath the sediment were many depressions located along the  caldera-collapse ring fractures.  These crater-like structures were probably formed by steam explosions as water began to  accumulate within the still-hot debris shortly after the cataclysmic eruption.                            Details of features beneath the surface of      Crater Lake constructed using data from the 2000 bathymetry survey.  Colors range from orange to blue with increasing      water depth.           A later USGS party mapped areas where large amounts of heat escaped from the lake floor.  In 1988 and 1989, scientists from  Oregon State University, the National Park Service, and the USGS explored parts of the lake floor with a manned submersible,  paying special attention to the warm areas identified earlier.  Several dives were devoted to exploring the volcanic features  on the lake floor and to sampling caldera-wall outcrops.  The exploration with the submersible suggested the need for  remapping the lake floor with modern techniques to provide a bathymetric (depth) map for interpreting the postcaldera  geologic history and as a base for further study of the lake itself.     The new bathymetric mapping was completed in the summer of 2000 by scientists from the USGS, the National Park Service, the  University of New Hampshire, and C & C Technologies.  Using a high-resolution acoustic mapping system mounted on a special  boat, they collected millions of accurately located echo soundings during a 5-day survey.  The information gained from this  latest survey not only provided a new maximum depth for Crater Lake – 1,949 feet (594 m) – but also resulted in a detailed  map of features on the lake floor.  By combining the new bathymetric data with past decades of other research, scientists now  have the clearest picture yet of events that happened since the massive eruption 7,700 years ago that destroyed Mount Mazama  and created Crater Lake.

GX000-96-10759551	"U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 074-97    Online Version 1.1      Living on Active Volcanoes—The Island of    Hawai'i                           People          on the Island of Hawai`i face many hazards that come with living on or          near active volcanoes. These include lava flows, explosive eruptions,          volcanic smog, damaging earthquakes, and tsunamis (giant seawaves). As          the population of the island grows, the task of reducing the risk from          volcano hazards becomes increasingly difficult. To help protect lives          and property, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists at the Hawaiian          Volcano Observatory closely monitor and study Hawai`i's volcanoes and          issue timely warnings of hazardous activity.                         Late in the evening of June 1, 1950, after many residents of Ho`okena-mauka village on the west coast of the Island of Hawai`i had already gone to bed, Mauna Loa Volcano suddenly began to erupt. Hot, glowing lava poured from fissures and rushed down the southwest flank of the volcano. In only 3 hours, the swiftly flowing lava traveled 14 miles and entered the village. The darkness was lit by flames as the molten lava consumed several houses and the Post Office. By daybreak, lava flows had crossed the area's only road in two places, cutting off all escape routes. Fortunately, the residents of Ho`okena-mauka escaped unharmed, but for some it was a close call.                                                              In 1990,          flows of lava from Kilauea Volcano on the Island of Hawai`i invaded Kalapana,          a coastal community treasured for its historic sites and black-sand beaches.          Although the residents were able to evacuate safely, their homes were          incinerated, and by the end of that year all of Kalapana lay buried under          50 feet of lava. In the past 1,100 years, more than 90 percent of Kilauea          's surface has been covered by new lava flows. Ancient Hawaiian communities          were able to easily relocate when threatened by lava flows, but modern          communities, with their greater dependence on permanent structures, highways,          and utilities, are more vulnerable.              The Island of Hawai`i is composed of five volcanoes, two of which–Mauna Loa and Kilauea–have erupted repeatedly in this century. Another of these volcanoes, Hualalai, last erupted in 1801 and has the potential to erupt again within our lifetime. Most eruptions at Hawaiian volcanoes are not explosive and are characterized by the relatively quiet outflow of very fluid lava. These eruptions can still be deadly, because the lava may be erupted in huge volumes, and on steeper slopes fluid lava can rapidly travel many miles from its source.                                                                                  The Hawaiian          Islands are at the southeast end of a chain of volcanoes that began to          form more than 70 million years ago. Each island is made of one or more          volcanoes, which first erupted on the sea floor and emerged above the          ocean's surface only after countless eruptions. Most of the volcanoes          active in the past two centuries (red) are on the Island of Hawai`i, the          youngest island in the chain. Haleakala Volcano, on the Island of Maui,          also erupts every few centuries, most recently in 1790. Loihi, the newest          volcano, is still 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface.              Mauna Loa, the world's largest active volcano, last erupted in 1984. During that 3-week-long eruption, rivers of lava came within 4 miles of the outskirts of the coastal city of Hilo. Most of Mauna Loa's eruptions in the last 150 years began at eruption sites (vents) near the volcano's remote 13,677-foot-high summit. About half of these summit eruptions quickly developed into eruptions on the flanks of the volcano. Mauna Loa's flank eruptions usually occur along one of two zones of weakness, called rift zones, that extend partway down its northeast and southwest slopes. A few eruptions also have taken place from isolated vents on the volcano's northern slope.     Eruptions from Mauna Loa's northeast rift zone can send lava flows coursing toward distant Hilo. However, those on the southwest rift zone present the greater threat to life and property, because residential areas developed since the volcano's 1950 eruption lie immediately downslope of potential vents.     Kilauea Volcano, Mauna Loa's younger neighbor, tends to have long-lasting    eruptions. Kilauea's ongoing eruption, which began in 1983, is already the volcano's    most destructive in the past 100 years. From 1983 to 1991, lava flows repeatedly    invaded communities on Kilauea's coastal south flank, burying 8 miles of highway    and destroying 181 houses and a visitor center in Hawai`i Volcanoes National    Park. Most lava flows erupted since 1992 have remained within the National Park,    but Kilauea's geologic history indicates that future activity will again threaten    residential areas on the volcano's south flank.                                                                                                    Lava flows            are the volcano hazard most likely to seriously threaten people and            property on the Island of Hawai`i. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)            prepares and periodically revises maps of lava-flow hazard zones for            the island. These zones are based on the locations of probable eruption            sites, likely paths of lava flows, and how frequently lava has covered            an area in the geologic past.                    Although Kilauea's eruptions tend to last longer, Mauna Loa poses a greater hazard because of the enormous volumes of lava it produces and the greater steepness of its slopes. Mauna Loa's 1984 eruption paved 16 square miles of land with lava in just 3 weeks, whereas the ongoing eruption of Kilauea that began in 1983 took 3 years to cover a comparable area.    Although explosive eruptions occur infrequently at Hawaiian volcanoes, they    can be devastating. In about 1790, Kilauea exploded in the deadliest eruption    known to have occurred in what is now the United States. At least 80 people    were killed when a group of Hawaiian warriors and their families was overwhelmed    by an extremely fast-moving flow of hot gas and ash (pyroclastic surge) near    Kilauea's summit. Thick deposits of volcanic ash on the Island of Hawai`i indicate    that much more powerful explosive eruptions have occurred in prehistoric times.    Sulfur dioxide gas, continuously emitted during Kilauea's current long-lived    eruption, has resulted in persistent volcanic smog (""vog"") in downwind areas.    Vog, as well as acid rain, forms when sulfur dioxide gas reacts with atmospheric    moisture. Vog aggravates respiratory problems, and acid rain damages crops and    corrodes metal. On the Island of Hawai`i, the drinking water of many homes with    rain-water catchment systems has been contaminated by lead leached by acid rain    from roofing and plumbing materials.    Earthquakes are another hazard associated with active volcanoes, and the Island of Hawai`i experiences thousands each year. Most of these are too small to feel, but about once a decade a large quake shakes the entire island and causes widespread damage. Before and during an eruption, many small earthquakes occur as molten rock (magma) forces its way through the upper parts of a volcano's interior, and such quakes often provide early warnings of changes in eruptive activity. Deeper within a volcano, stronger earthquakes can be triggered by the stresses exerted by rising magma.    The most powerful earthquake to strike the Island of Hawai`i in the past century    was the magnitude 7.2 shock of November 1975. This quake occurred beneath Kilauea's    south flank and generated huge ocean waves (tsunamis) that caused two deaths    and substantial damage along the nearby coast. Such locally generated tsunamis    are extremely dangerous, because there is no time to warn the public before    the waves strike. A strong earthquake should therefore be regarded by people    near the coast as a signal to leave immediately for higher ground! (See  Surviving    A Tsunami—Lessons from Chile, Hawaii, and Japan ,    USGS Circular 1187 )                                                                                  The USGS          Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) operates a network of seismometers          to monitor the thousands of earthquakes that the Island of Hawai`i experiences          each year. Most of these are too small to feel, but about once a decade          a large quake shakes the entire island and causes widespread damage. To          help protect people and property in the large earthquakes that are certain          to occur in the future, HVO scientists are working with State and local          officials to ensure that building codes used on Hawai`i accurately reflect          the seismic hazard.              To better understand Hawaiian volcanoes and the hazards they pose, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) was established in 1912 at the summit of Kilauea. The observatory, operated continuously by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) since 1947, studies current geologic activity at Hawaii's volcanoes, as well as evidence of past eruptions, earthquakes, and other volcano hazards. HVO scientists use this information to provide timely warnings to local officials and the public, to assess long-term volcano hazards, and to make hazard-zone maps that help guide land-use planning decisions.     The progress of Kilauea's current eruption is being closely tracked by HVO scientists. The information they provide on projected lava-flow movements helps public safety officials determine when it is necessary to evacuate residents or close roads. On Mauna Loa, HVO instruments have detected swelling indicating that the volcano's magma reservoir has been refilling since its 1984 eruption. HVO scientists continue to monitor this swelling and are watching for signs of increased earthquake activity such as that which preceded the volcano's last two eruptions.                                                  Spectacular          lava fountains are a common feature of eruptions at Hawaiian volcanoes.          This relatively small lava fountain from Kilauea Volcano was active in          1993. In the photo, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist from the Hawaiian          Volcano Observatory has just collected a sample of the newly erupted lava          for analysis. The chemical composition and other characteristics of such          samples can indicate impending changes in a volcano's eruptive activity.                     By helping to educate residents, public officials, and visitors about volcano hazards on the Hawaiian Islands, USGS scientists at HVO are enabling people to lead safer lives in a setting where spectacular volcanic eruptions and damaging earthquakes occur. The work of HVO is part of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program's ongoing efforts to help protect people's lives and property in all of the volcanic regions of the United States, including Hawai`i, California, the Pacific Northwest, Wyoming, and Alaska.

GX009-61-1225359	"July 31, 2003    A weekly feature provided by scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.      The age of youngest volcanic rocks varies greatly among the Hawaiian Islands                          It's an easy question to answer, ""how old is the youngest volcanic rock on the Big Island?""  With Kilauea in virtually continuous eruption, the youngest products are ""right now!""  But what of the other Hawaiian islands?  The answer ranges widely, without a regular pattern for the age of complete extinction. On Maui, the youngest lava flows are those from Haleakala, emplaced either about 200 years ago (A.D. 1790) or 400 years ago (about A.D. 1600).  This discrepancy, discussed in previous Volcano Watch articles, stems from the difference between oral tradition (the younger age) and radiocarbon ages (older).   West Maui volcano was last active about 0.38 million years ago, when the cinder cone Pu`u Laina erupted near Lahaina town.  At about the same time, another cone, now largely quarried away, was active north of Ma`alaea.  These eruptions occurred long after the main growth of West Maui, which ended about 1 million years ago.  Sporadic eruptions occurring late in a volcano's history are commonly ascribed to a rejuvenated stage of eruptive activity. Kaho`olawe was last active about 1.15 million years ago.  Nearby Lana`i probably ended its activity about 1.25 million years ago.   Moloka`i has two volcanoes.  The younger, East Moloka`i, was largely finished by about 1.4 million years ago, but it experienced rejuvenated-stage volcanism more recently.  Along its north shore, a small volcano built the Kalaupapa Peninsula between about 0.38 and 0.5 million years ago West Moloka`i volcano is not well dated.  It probably last erupted about 1.8 million years ago.   O`ahu possesses surprisingly young rejuvenated-stage volcanic rocks.  Eruptions as recently as about 50,000 years ago produced Koko Crater, one of the youngest of the features known as the Honolulu Volcanics.  Diamond Head, another of the Honolulu Volcanics, is about 0.4-0.5 million years old.   On Kaua`i, the main volcanic episode ended about 4 million years ago.  But sporadic rejuvenated-stage eruptions have persisted as recently as 0.5 million years ago.  These lava flows were sampled on the east side of the island, whereas flows ranging from 1 to 2 million years are scattered more broadly.  Source vents for specific lava flows aren't known, but the youngest Kaua`i flows may have issued from Kilohana Crater or Hanahanapuni.   Ni`ihau ended its shield-building stage about 4.9 million years ago.  Latest eruptions may have been as recent as about 0.4 million years ago, the culmination of rejuvenated-stage volcanism that began 2.5 million years ago. The inception of island volcanism progresses down the island chain.  Ancient Hawaiians had it correct in their story of the demigod Maui, who fished the islands from the sea.  Last on his string was the Big Island, youngest of the islands to surface.  The chants that record goddess Pele's flight down the island chain, reaching her current home at Kilauea, are also correct in describing the progression of shield-stage volcanism, the stage when over 95 percent of an oceanic volcano's lava flows are erupted    But when the shield growth ends, volcanoes dribble irregularly to oblivion.  The duration of their waning probably depends on diverse and as yet incompletely understood phenomena.  Are there differences within the lithosphere, the thick rind that includes the Earth's crust, that allow magma to reach the surface more easily beneath some volcanoes than others?  Does the hot spot itself wax and wane so that more or less heat is available to drive the melting process?  The answers to these as yet unanswered questions must explain the varying ages of youngest volcanic rocks from each island.     Activity Update     Eruptive activity at the Pu`u `O`o vent of the shield-building Kilauea Volcano continued unabated during the past week.  Surface breakouts from the east-side lobe of the main Mother's Day flow extend down Pulama pali to just above Paliuli.  Lava continues to move along the western edge of the Kohola flow from the top of Pulama pali to 750 meters (yards) beyond the base of Paliuli.  The distal end of the active Kohola arm in the coastal flats is 1.1 km (.7 mi) from the end of the Chain of Craters road.  Lava stopped entering the ocean at the Highcastle delta, and there is no ocean entry at this time.   There were no earthquakes reported felt on the island this past week.     Mauna Loa is not erupting.  The summit region continues to inflate slowly.  Seismic activity remains low, with only one earthquake located in the summit area during the last seven days.

From: Simon, 1999, Channel and Drainage-Basin Response of the Toutle River System in the Aftermath of the 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington: USGS Open-File Report 96-633        The 1980 eruptions of Mount St. Helens in southwestern Washington marked the re-awakening of a relatively young (40,000 years) volcano that had been dormant since 1857.  Frequent dacitic eruptions during the previous 2,500 years had produced pyroclstic flows, ash falls, debris flows, lava domes, and lava flows of andesite and basalt.  Pyroclastic flows and lahars accompanied most eruptive periods and were largely responsible for forming fans around the base of the volcano, some of     which dammed the North Fork Toutle River to form Spirit Lake   between 3,300 and 4,000 years ago.  The magnitudes of the 1980 eruptions were not exceptional by worldwide historical standards; however, they were the first volcanic eruptions in the conterminous United States     since 1914 (Lassen Peak)   and focused national attention on events leading up to the     climactic eruption of May 18, 1980 .    That eruption led to exceptional opportunities for scientific observations, data collection, and the study of infrequent and often inaccessible geologic events and processes.                      Northwest Legends             From:  U.S. Department of Agriculture, Gifford Pinchot National Forest ""Mount St. Helens""  Broshure, 1980: Government Printing Office GPO 1980 699-331       Northwest Indians told early explorers about the firey Mount St. Helens.  In fact, an Indian name for the mountain,  Louwala-Clough , means ""smoking mountain"".  According to one legend, the mountain was once a beautiful maiden,  ""Loowit"" .  When two sons of the Great Spirit ""Sahale"" fell in love with her, she could not choose between them.  The two braves,  Wyeast  and  Klickitat  fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process.  Sahale was furious.  He smote the three lovers and erected a mighty mountain  peak where each fell.  Because  Loowit  was beautiful, her mountain (Mount St. Helens) was a beautiful, symmetrical cone of dazzling white.   Wyeast  (Mount Hood)  lifts his head in pride, but  Klickitat  (Mount Adams) wept to see the beautiful maiden wrapped in snow, so he bends his head as he gazes on St. Helens.         From: Scott, et.al., 1997,  Geologic History of Mount Hood Volcano, Oregon -- A Field-Trip Guidebook: USGS Open-File Report 97-263      Native American legends abound with descriptions of the brothers  Wy'east  (Hood) and  Pahto  (Adams) battling for the fair  La-wa-la-clough  (St. Helens).  Behaviors attributed to Wy'east include hurtling of hot rocks from gaping holes, sending forth streams of liquid fire, loss of formerly high summits, and choking of valleys with rocks.  These are fair descriptions of Mount Hood's reconstructed activity over the past two millennia.        From: Pringle, 1993, Roadside Geology of Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument and Vicinity: Washington State Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geology and Earth Resources Information Circular 88      Native cultures in the Pacific Northwest, such as the Salish and Klickitat Indians, called  Mount St. Helens   Loo-Wit Lat-kla  or  Louwala-Clough  (fire mountain or smoking mountain).  In their legends, a female spirit (Mount St. Helens) tried to make peace between two sons (Mounts Adams and Hood) of the Great Spirit who fought over her, throwing fiery rocks at each other and causing earthquakes.  The warring of the sons destroyed the Bridge of the Gods that once crossed the Columbia River.  These legends are undoubtedly referring to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes that both frightened and awed the area's early inhabitants.                    Baron St. Helens              From: Foxworthy and Hill, 1982, Volcanic Eruptions of 1980 at Mount St. Helens, The First 100 Days: USGS Professional Paper 1249         Mount St. Helens  was named for British diplomat   Alleyne Fitzherbert  (1753-1839), whose title was   Baron St. Helens .  The mountain was named by  Commander  George Vancouver   and the officers of H.M.S. Discovery  while they were surveying the northern Pacific coast from 1792 to 1794.               Historical Information            From: Foxworthy and Hill, 1982, Volcanic Eruptions of 1980 at Mount St. Helens, The First 100 Days: USGS Professional Paper 1249        Mount St. Helens  was known as ""the Fuji of America"" because its symmetrical beauty was similar to that of the famous Japanese volcano.  The graceful cone top, whose glistening cap of perennial snow and ice dazzled the viewer, is now largely gone.  On May 18, 1980, the missing mountaintop was transformed in a few hours into the extensive volcanic ash that blanketed much of the Northwestern United States and into various other deposits closer to the mountain.      Even before its recent loss of height, Mount St. Helens was not one of the highest peaks in the     Cascade Range .  Its summit altitude of 9,677 feet made it only the fifth highest peak in Washington.  It stood out handsomely, however, from surrounding hills because it rose thousands of feet above them and had a perennial cover of ice and snow.  The peak rose more than 5,000 feet above its base, where the lower flanks merge with adjacent ridges.  The mountain is about 6 miles across at its base, which is at an altitude of about 4,400 feet on the northeastern side and about 4,000 feet elsewhere.  At the pre-eruption timberline (upper limit of trees), the width of the cone was about 4 miles.      Mount St. Helens is 34 miles almost due west of     Mount Adams ,   which is in the eastern part of the Cascade Range.  These ""sister and brother"" volcanic mountains are each about 50 miles from     Mount Rainier ,   the giant of Cascade volcanoes.      Mount Hood ,   the nearest major volcanic peak in Oregon, is about 60 miles southeast of Mount St. Helens.      Mount St. Helens was named for British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert (1753-1839), whose title was Baron St. Helens.  The mountain was named by Commander George Vancouver and the officers of H.M.S. Discovery  while they were surveying the northern Pacific coast from 1792 to 1794.       Mount St. Helens was recognized as a volcano at least as early as 1835; the first geologist apparently viewed the volcano 6 years later.  James Dwight Dana of Yale University, while sailing with the Charles Wilkes U.S.Exploring Expedition, saw the peak (then quiescent) from off the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841.  Another member of the expedition later described ""cellular basaltic lavas"" at the mountain's base.      Although Mount St. Helens is in Skamania County, the best access routes to the mountain run through Cowlitz County on the west.  State Route 504, ...  connects with the heavily traveled Interstate Highway 5, about 34 miles to the west.  That major north-south highway skirts the low-lying cities of Castle Rock, Longview, and Kelso along the Cowlitz River and passes through Vancouver, Washington - Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area less than 50 miles to the southwest.  The community nearest the volcano is Cougar, which is in the Lewis River valley about 11 miles south-southwest of the peak.  Guifford Pinchot National Forest surrounds Mount St. Helens, but some land  ... are Washington State lands or are privately owned. ...       Mount St. Helens, like most other Cascade volcanoes, is a great cone of rubble consisting of lava rock interlayered with pyroclastic and other deposits.  Volcanic cones of this internal structure are called     composite cones or stratovolcanoes .  Mount St. Helens includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several     domes   of dacite lava have erupted.  The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit; another formed    Goat Rocks  on the northern flank. ...                  Early Documentation                    [Image,53K,JPG]    Mount St. Helens before May 18, 1980.     -- U.S. Forest Service Photo by Jim Nieland             From: Pringle, 1993, Roadside Geology of Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument and Vicinity: Washington State Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geology and Earth Resources Information Circular 88      The first documented observation of Mount St. Helens by Europeans was by George Vancouver on May 19, 1792, as he was charting the inlets of Puget Sound at Point Lawton, near present-day Seattle.  Vancouver did not name the mountain until October 20, 1792, when it came into view as his ship passed the mouth of the Columbia River.      A few years later, Mount St. Helens experienced a major eruption.  Explorers, traders, missionaries, and ethnologists heard reports of the event from various peoples, including the Sanpoil Indians of eastern Washington and a Spokane chief who told of the effects of ash fallout.  Later studies determined that the eruption occurred in 1800.      The Lewis and Clark expedition sighted the mountain from the Columbia River in 1805 and 1806 but reported no eruptive events or evidence of recent volcanism.  However, their graphic descriptions of the quicksand and channel conditions at the mouth of the Sandy River near Portland, Oregon, suggest that Mount Hood had erupted within a couple decades prior to their arrival.      Meredith Gairdner, a physician at Fort Vancouver, wrote of darkness and haze during possible eruptive activity at Mount St. Helens in 1831 and 1835.  He reported seeing what he called lava flows, although it is more likely he would have seen mudflows or perhaps small pyroclastic flows of incandescent rocks.      On November 22, 1842, Reverend Josiah Parrish, while in Champoeg, Oregon, (about 80 miles or 130 kilometers south-southwest of the volcano), witnessed Mount St. Helens in eruption.  Ash fallout from this event evidently reached The Dalles, Oregon (48 miles or 80 kilometers southeast of the volcano).  Missionaries at The Dalles corroborated Parrish's account.  Captain J.C. Fremont recounts the report of a clergyman named Brewer, who gave him a sample of ash a year later (Wilkes, 1845):         ""On the 23rd day of the preceding November, St. Helens    had scattered its ashes, like a light fall of snow, over    the Dalles of the Columbia.""        Other accounts of the same ashfall note that it was ""like fine sand"", its color ""appeared like ashes"", and the odor was ""that of sulphur"" (Majors, 1980).      Contemporary sketches and paintings by Paul Kane suggest the mountain was probably erupting at a point halfway down the north slope before or during 1847.  The vent was apparently the Goat Rocks dome, which was removed by the 1980 eruption.  On the basis of these and other observations, scientists think eruptive activity may have continued intermittently until 1857.      Small eruptions were reported in 1898, 1903, and 1921, but these events were not independently confirmed, nor have their deposits been identified.  Judging by the nature of the post-May 18, 1980, activity at Mount St. Helens, it is likely that these events were steam emissions, small explosions, or large rockfalls.             From: Tilling, Topinka, and Swanson, 1990, Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future: USGS Special Interest Publication       Some  Indians   of   the   Pacific   Northwest   variously called   Mount   St.   Helens    ""Louwala-Clough,""   or ""smoking   mountain.""   The   modern   name,    Mount    St. Helens,  was  given  to  the  volcanic  peak  in   1792   by Captain  George  Vancouver  of  the   British   Royal Navy,  a  seafarer  and  explorer.  He  named  it  in   honor  of  a  fellow  countryman,  Alleyne   Fitzherbert,   who held  the  title  Baron  St.  Helens  and  who  was  at  the time   the   British   Ambassador   to   Spain.    Vancouver also  named  three  other   volcanoes   in   the   Cascades- Mounts  Baker,   Hood,   and   Rainier-for   British   naval officers.      The local Indians and early settlers in the then          sparsely populated region witnessed the occasional         violent outbursts of Mount St. Helens. The volcano        was particularly restless in the mid-19th century,       when it was intermittently active for at least a        26-year span from 1831 to 1857. Some scientists        suspect that Mount St. Helens also was active sporadically during the three decades before 1831, including a major explosive eruption in 1800. Although        minor steam explosions may have occurred in                1898, 1903, and 1921, the mountain gave little or         no evidence of being a volcanic hazard for more          than a century after 1857. Consequently, the majority of 20th-century residents and visitors thought  of Mount St. Helens not as a menace, but as a serene, beautiful mountain playground teeming with wildlife and available for leisure activities throughout the year. At the base of the volcano's northern flank, Spirit Lake, with its clear, refreshing water and wooded shores, was especially popular as a recreational area for hiking, camping, fishing, swimming and boating.                Hydrologic Setting              From: Iverson and Martinson (eds.), 1986, Mount St. Helens: American Geomorphological Field Group, Field Trip Guidebook and Abstracts, 1986 Conference September 3-6, Cispus Center, Washington.         Mount St. Helens  is a young volcano that developed over the last 40,000 years within a highly dissected terrain of     Tertiary    volcanic and metavolcanic rocks.  Major valleys surrounding the volcano were extensively glaciated during Pleistocene glacial advances, but mass wasting, fluvial, and other erosion processes have carved complex landforms that are not dominated by the signature of any single process.      Average annual precipitation ranges from 1,140 millimeters (45 inches) near the Columbia River to more than 3,200 millimeters (125 inches) on the upper slopes of the volcano.   About 75 percent of annual precipitation falls between October and March, forming a persistent snow pack above 1,000 meters (3,300 feet).    Storms are typically of long duration (days) and moderate intensity with 20 millimeters per hour (3/4 inch per hour)  occurring not more than once in 10 years. Most major floods result from prolonged rainfall or from warm rain on wet snow.      The pre-eruption landscape was dominated by dense coniferous forests and clear streams and lakes.  Forests below about 1,200 meters (4,000 feet) elevation were dominated by Douglas fir and western hemlock; at higher elevation true firs and mountain hemlock were dominant.  Clearcuts up to about 30 years in age were scattered throughout the area, especially on private lands northwest of the volcano.  Streams and lakes were cold and contained low levels of nutrients and organisms.  Productive resident and anadromous fisheries made these fast-flowing streams and clear lakes popular recreational areas.        From: Foxworthy and Hill, 1982, Volcanic Eruptions of 1980 at Mount St. Helens, The First 100 Days: USGS Professional Paper 1249       Streams that head on the volcano enter three main river systems -- the     Toutle River   on the north and north-west, the     Kalama River    on the west, and the     Lewis River   on the south and east.  The streams are fed by abundant rain and snow that dump an average of about 140 inches of water on Mount St. Helens a year, according to National Weather Service data.  The Lewis River is impounded by three dams for hydropower generation.   The southern and eastern sides of the volcano drain into an upstream  impoundment, the     Swift Reservoir ,   which is directly south of the volcano.       Water-related recreation has been one of the major activities in the area.  All three reservoirs on the Lewis River have been used extensively for recreation, as was     Spirit Lake    before 1980.  Before the eruption, Spirit Lake was impounded in the     North Fork Toutle River    valley by a natural dam formed chiefly of deposits from one or more ancient mudflows.  The principle resource of the region is timber, and many areas near the volcano had been logged recently and were still being logged at the beginning of the 1980 eruptive activity.                 Mount St. Helens Hydrology Menu                  Eruptive History             From: Wolfe and Pierson, 1995, Volcanic-Hazard Zonation for Mount St. Helens, Washington, 1995: USGS Open-File Report 95-497          Mount St. Helens  remains a potentially active and dangerous  volcano, even though it is now (1995) quiescent.  In the last 515  years, it is known to have produced 4 major explosive eruptions  (each with at least 1 cubic kilometer of eruption deposits) and dozens of lesser eruptions.  Two of the major eruptions were separated by  only 2 years.  One of those, in 1480 A.D., was about 5 times larger  than the May 18, 1980 eruption, and even larger eruptions are known  to have occurred during Mount St. Helens' brief but very active  50,000-year lifetime.  Following the most recent major eruption, on May 18, 1980,  there were 5 smaller explosive eruptions over a  period of 5 months. Thereafter, a series of 16 dome-building  eruptions through October 1986 constructed the new, 270-meter- (880-feet) high,   lava dome  in the crater formed by the May 18, 1980 eruption.          From: Swanson, Cameron, Evarts, Pringle, and Vance, 1989, IGC Field Trip T106: Cenozoic Volcanism in the Cascade Range and  Columbia Plateau, Southern Washington and Northernmost Oregon: American Geophysical Union Field Trip Guidebook T106.        Mount St. Helens is young .   Its oldest known deposits were erupted about 50-40 thousand years ago,  and the cone that partly collapsed in 1980 is only 2,200 years old.  Since its birth it has produced more than 60 tephra layers (Mullineaux, 1986), several tens of volcanically-induced debris flows (at least six of which entered the Columbia River 100 kilometers downstream (Scott, 1988)),  and the equivalent of 60 cubic kilometers of dacitic lava (Smith, 1987).  It has been the most active volcano in the Cascades during the Holocene, and for that reason its eruption in 1980 came as no surprise.  The volcano has been studied intensively, and its eruptive history is know with greater clarity than that of any other Cascade volcano.      Crandell (1987) divides the history of the volcano into     ""four extended stages of intermittent activity, each lasting two thousand years or longer.  The volcano is now in such a stage that began about 4,000 radiocarbon years ago"" .   The stages are separated by dormant intervals of thousands of years. Each stage contains eruptive periods with durations of decades to centuries; those periods for the current stage are named, but those for past stages are not.  Many carbon-14 and dendrochronologic ages (Crandell, et.al., 1981; Mullineaux, 1986; Yamaguchi, 1983, 1985) provide a well-constrained context within which to interpret the volcanic history.          [Table,27K,GIF]     Simplified Eruptive History of Mount St. Helens. Simplified from: Crandell, 1987                    Mount St. Helens Eruptive History Menu                 May 18, 1980            From: Foxworthy and Hill, 1982, Volcanic Eruptions of 1980 at Mount St. Helens, The First 100 Days: USGS Professional Paper 1249           On May 18, 1980 ,   after nearly 2 months of local earthquakes and steam eruptions, picturesque Mount St. Helens, ... suddenly began a major explosive eruption directed first northward and then upward.  The     lateral blast ,  which lasted only the first few minutes of a 9-hour continuous eruption, devastated more htan 150 square miles of forest and recreation area, killed countless animals, and left about 60 persons dead or missing.  The 9-hour eruption, the huge    debris avalanche   that immediatedly preceded it, and intermittent eruptions during the following 3 days removed about 4 billion cubic yards (0.7 cubic mile) of new magmatic material and of the upper and northern parts of the mountain, including about 170 million cubic yards (0.03 cubic mile) of glacial snow and ice.  The eruption caused    pyroclastic flows  and many    mudflows ,   the largest of which produced deposits so extensive and voluminous that they reached and blocked the shipping channel of the Columbia River about 70 river miles from the volcano.  The May 18 eruption blew     volcanic ash ,  consisting of pulverized old rock from the mountain's core as well as solidified new lava, more than 15 miles into the air.  Winds carried the ash generally eastward across the United States and, in trace amounts, around the world.  The ash, which fell in troublesome amounts as far east as western Montana, severely disrupted travel, caused widespread economic loss, and resulted in other problems that persisted ...          From: Brantley, 1994, Volcanoes of the United States: USGS General Interest Publication        Mount St. Helens, Washington:   The catastrophic eruption on    May 18, 1980 ,  was preceded by 2 months of intense activity that included more than 10,000 earthquakes, hundreds of small     phreatic (steam-blast) explosions ,   and the outward growth of the volcano's entire north flank by more than 80 meters.  A magnitude 5.1 earthquake struck beneath the volcano at 8:32 a.m. on May 18, setting in motion the devastating eruption.      Within seconds of the earthquake, the volcano's bulging north flank slid away in the largest    landslide   in recorded history, triggering a destructive, lethal    lateral blast   of hot gas, steam, and rock debris that swept across the landscape as fast as 1,100 kilometers per hour.  Temperatures within the blast reached as high as 300 degrees Celsius.  Snow and ice on the volcano melted, forming torrents of water and rock debris that swept down river valleys leading from the volcano.  Within minutes, a massive plume of ash thrust 19 kilometers into the sky, where the prevailing wind carried about 490 tons of ash across 57,000 square kilometers of the Western United States.      Following the 1980 explosive eruption, more than a dozen extrusions of thick, pasty lava built a mound-shaped     lava dome   in the new crater.  The dome is about 1,100 meters in diameter and 250 meters tall.                Mount St. Helens May 18, 1980 Eruption Menu               Lava Dome               From: Brantley and Myers, 2000, Mount St. Helens -- From the 1980 Eruption to 2000: USGS Fact Sheet FS036-00         Mount St. Helens Lava Dome   Elevation of top of dome:  7,155 feet  Height:  876 feet above 1980 crater floor  Diameter:  About 3,500 feet  Volume:  97 million cubic yards           From:  Tilling, Topinka, and Swanson, 1990,  Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future: USGS General Interest Publication       The dome at Mount St. Helens  is termed a     composite dome    by scientists, because it represents the net result of many eruptive events, not just one event. The dome-building process may be  pictured as the periodic squeezing of an upward-pointing tube of toothpaste or caulking compound. The process is  dynamic, involving the upward movement of new material, cracking and pushing aside of old material, sloughing of  material from steep surfaces of the dome, and occasional, small but violent explosions that blast out pieces of the dome.       At the start of 1990,  the composite dome  was about 3,480 feet by 2,820 feet in diameter and rose about 1,150 feet above the low point on the adjacent crater floor. It has a volume of about 97 million cubic yards,  less than 3 percent of the volume of the volcano (about 3.5 billion cubic yards) removed during the landslide and lateral blast on May 18, 1980. If the dome resumes growth at its average rate of the 1980s (about 17 million cubic yards per year), it would take nearly a century to fill in the summit crater and more than 200 years to rebuild Mount St. Helens to its pre-1980 size.

The Newberry and South Sister networks were re-measured in 1986 and will be measured periodically in future years.  Improvements since 1984 in the recording of endpoint and flightline temperatures resulted in better overall data than obtained previously.  The improvements included: calibration of all the sensors and precision thermistors, installation of a new recording system for flightline data, and recording of endpoint temperatures 6 meters above ground level.  The data collected in 1985 and 1986 indicate little or no apparent deformation at either volcano between surveys.       From: University of Washington's Geophysics Program Website, 2001        In addition to locating regional earthquakes, the      Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network (PNSN) ,   in cooperation with the Cascades Volcano Observatory, is also responsible for monitoring seismic activity at volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest.  The PNSN currently operates seismometers on or near Mount Adams, Mount Rainier,   Mount St. Helens , Mount Hood, Mount Baker, Three Sisters, and Crater Lake.                Mount St. Helens Monitoring Menu                 Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument            From: Tilling, Topinka, and Swanson, 1990, Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future,  USGS Special Interest Publication       Despite the troubled economy in early 1980s, tens        of thousands of visitors flocked to the area surrounding Mount St. Helens to marvel at the effects of the     eruption. On August 27, 1982, President Reagan          signed into law a measure setting aside 110,000      acres around the volcano as the  Mount St. Helens     National Volcanic Monument , the nation's first such monument managed by the USFS. At dedication        ceremonies on May 18, 1983, Max Peterson, head    of the USFS, said,""we can take pride in having   preserved the unique episode of natural history for future generations."" Since then, many trails, viewpoints, information stations, campgrounds, and picnic areas have been established to accommodate the increasing number of visitors each year.       Beginning in the summer of 1983, visitors have been able to drive to Windy Ridge, only 4 miles northeast of the crater. From this spectacular vantage point overlooking Spirit Lake,  people see firsthand not only the awesome evidence of a volcano's destruction, but also the remarkable, gradual recovery of the land as revegetation proceeds and wildlife returns. A majestic  Visitor Center was completed in December 1986 at Silver Lake,  about 30 miles west of Mount St. Helens and five miles  east  of              Interstate Highway 5. By the end of 1989, the Center had hosted more than 1.5 million visitors.  Opening in 1993 was an interpretation complex in the Coldwater Lake area,  and in 1997 an interpretation complex in the Johnston area,  from which visitors can view the inside of the crater and its dome from the site of David Johnston's camp on the morning of May 18, 1980. Mountain climbing to the summit  of  the  volcano                has been allowed since 1986.       The National Volcanic Monument  preserves some of the best examples and sites affected by volcanic events for scientific studies, education, and recreation. Intensive monitoring of the volcano is now all the more important to ensure the safety of the scientists and the monument's visitors.

From: U.S. National Park Service,  Lassen Volcanic National Park Website, April 2000        Before the     1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens   in Washington,  Lassen Peak  was the most recent volcanic outburst in the contiguous 48 states.  The peak is the southernmost volcano in the     Cascade Range   which extends from here into Canada.  The western part of the park features great lava pinnacles (huge mountains created by lava flows), jagged craters, and steaming sulphur vents.  It is cut by spectacular glaciated canyons and is dotted and threaded by lakes and rushing clear streams.  Snowbanks persist year-round and beautiful meadows are spread with wildflowers in spring.  The eastern part of the park is a vast lava plateau more than one mile above sea level.  Here are found small    cinder cones   ( Fairfield Peak ,  Hat Mountain , and  Crater Butte ).  Forested with pine and fir, this area is studded with small lakes, but it boasts few streams.   Warner Valley , marking the southern edge of the  Lassen Plateau , features hot spring areas ( Boiling Springs Lake ,  Devils Kitchen , and  Terminal Geyser ).  This forested, steep valley also has gorgeous large meadows. ...      The  Lassen geothermal area  --   Sulphur Works ,  Bumpass Hell  (largest),  Little Hot Springs Valley ,  Boining Springs Lake ,  Devils Kitchen , and  Terminal Geyser  -- offer bubbling mud pots, steaming fumaroles, and boiling water.  Some of these thermal features are getting hotter.                 Peter Lassen            From: U.S. National Park Service, Lassen Volcanic National Park Website, December 2000        History here generally describes the period from 1840, even though   Jedediah Smith  passed through in 1828 on his overland trek to the West Coast. California's gold rush brought the first settlers. Two pioneer trails, developed by  William Nobles  and  Peter Lassen , are associated with the park. In 1851, Nobles discovered an alternate route to California, passing through Lassen. Sections of the Lassen and Nobles Emigrant Trail are still visible.    Lassen, for whom the park is named , guided settlers near here and tried to establish a city. Mining, power development projects, ranching, and timbering were all attempted. The area's early federal protection saved it from heavy logging.        From: Lassen County Chamber of Commerce Website, 2002       Peter Lassen  is the namesake of the County. He was a Danish emigrant who came to California in 1840 and spent his last years prospecting the Honey Lake Valley. He was murdered in 1859 on an expedition in the Black Rock Desert.          From: California Environmental Resources Website, 2002        Peter Lassen  opened the Lassen Emigrant Trail in 1848 when he led a 12-wagon emigrant train from Missouri to California.  The route was extensively traveled during the years 1848-53 by emigrants seeking gold,  adventure, and a new life in the west - but  because of the hardships of the route and the hostility of the Indians, the trail  was little used after 1853.               Historical Information                    Eruptive History           From: Clynne, et.al., 2000, Volcano Hazards of the Lassen Volcanic National Park Area, California: USGS Fact Sheet 022-00       The Lassen region has been volcanically active for more than 3 million years.  The Lassen ""volcanic center"" began to erupt about 600,000 years ago.  From 600,000 to 400,000 years ago, eruptions built a large volcano, often referred to as "" Brokeoff Volcano ""  or "" Mount Tehama "".  Later, this volcano became inactive and was mostly eroded away, leaving remnants that include  Brokeoff Mountain ,  Mount Conard ,  Mount Diller , and  Diamond Peak .   Subsequent eruptions in the Lassen volcanic center have formed more than 30 steep-sided lava domes (the   Lassen dome field ).  The most recently active parts of the volcanic center are  Lassen Peak  and other young domes formed in the past 50,000 years.        From: Wood and Kienle, 1990, Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada: Cambridge University Press, 354p., p.216-219,  Contribution by Michael A. Clynne       The  Lassen volcanic center  in     Lassen Volcanic National Park   consists of an andesitic    stratovolcano , a     dacite dome field ,   and peripheral small andesitic    shield volcanoes .  Lassen's long and complex eruptive history is a 600,000-year-long record of volcanism associated with the generation, rise, emplacement, and evolution of a plutonic magma body in the crust.       The evolution of the Lassen volcanic center    began with the construction of  Brokeoff  volcano, an andesitic stratovolcano.  Glacial erosion, enhanced by    hydrothermal alteration    of permeable cone rocks, has resulted in deep erosion of Brokeoff volcano.  The major erosional remnants,  Brokeoff Mountain ,  Mount Diller ,  Mount Conard , and  Diamond Peak , enclose a central depression that marks the position of  Brokeoff volcano , which was approximately 3,350 meters high, had a basal diameter of approximately 12 kilometers, and a volume of about 80 cubic kilometers.  Potassium-argon ages of lavas from Brokeoff volcano range from 0.59-0.39 million years ago.  Thus, Brokeoff was active for approximately 200,000 years.  ...      Coincident with the extinction of  Brokeoff volcano   was a major change in the character of volcanism at the  Lassen volcanic center .   Activity shifted to the north flank of Brokeoff volcano and became more silicic and episodic.  Three sequences of silicic lavas and a group of hybrid lavas were erupted in the last 400,000 years. A conspicuous feature of the lavas of the dacite dome field is the ubiquitous presence of blobs of quenched andesitic magma, formed by samll amounts of andesite mixing into the silicic magma system.      The first expression of the silicic magma system was eruption of small rhyodacite lava flows and a rhyolite dome at 400,000 years ago.  They were quickly followed by eruption of more than 50 cubic kilometers of rhyolitic magma as air-fall tephra and ash flows.  This eruption is thought to have produced a small    caldera    on the northern flank of  Brokeoff volcano   that is now filled by two subsequent sequences of lava comprising the dacitic dome field.  The lavas of the early sequence are best  preserved on  Raker Peak  and  Mount Conard .  The ash flows are preserved only to the west in the  Manton area ; the air-fall tephra is widely recognized in nearby states.      The second and third sequences of lavas at the    Lassen volcanic center  comprise the dacite dome field.  The second sequence erupted from 250,000-200,000 years ago ... produced a cluster of 12 lava domes and associated thick flows with a total volume of approximately 15-25 cubic kilometers.  The vents for these lavas were concentrated along the inferred edge of the caldera on the north flank of Brokeoff volcano.   Bumpass Mountain ,  Mount Helen ,  Ski Heil Peak , and  Reading Peak  are the most prominent domes. ... The third sequence consists of porphyritic hornblende-biotite rhyodacite erupted as lava domes, short thick lava flows, and pyroclastic flows erupted in at least 12 episodes during the past 100,000 years.    Rocks of this sequence form the northern and western portions of the dacite dome field, and their vents are concentrated in linear chains near the inferred western edge of the old caldera.  The most prominent features of this sequence are   Eagle Peak  (55,000 years ago),  Sunflower Flat  domes (35,000 years ago),    Lassen Peak  (approximately 25,000 years ago), and    Chaos Crags  (1,050 years ago). ...       A group of hybrid andesite lavas, called quartz basalt by previous geologists,  are associated with the silicic lavas.  They form lava-flow complexes with agglutinate cones marking their vents. ... A volume of approximately 10 cubic kilometers of hybrid andesite erupted around the margins of the dacite dome field in ten episodes over the last 300,000 years.   Hat Mountain ,  Raker Peak , and    Cinder Cone    are the most prominent features.  The products of the     1915 eruption of Lassen Peak   belong to this sequence.       Three episodes of volcanism have occurred at the Lassen volcanic center in the past 1,100 years.  These are the complex eruption at    Chaos Crags ,   the eruptions at    Cinder Cone ,   and the    summit eruptions of Lassen Peak in 1914-1917 .  ...              Mount Tehema - Brokeoff Volcano           From: Clynne, et.al., 2000, Volcano Hazards of the Lassen Volcanic National Park Area, California: USGS Fact Sheet 022-00       The Lassen region has been volcanically active for more than 3 million years.  The Lassen ""volcanic center"" began to erupt about 600,000 years ago.  From 600,000 to 400,000 years ago, eruptions built a large volcano, often referred to as "" Brokeoff Volcano ""  or "" Mount Tehama "".

From: U.S. National Park Service Website, Geology Fieldnotes - Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, April 2000       About 600,000 years ago a great    Pacific Ring of Fire     stratovolcano   ( Mount Tehama ) gradually built up here through countless erutpions.  Before  Lassen Peak  was emplaced,  Mount Tehama  had collapsed, but its    caldera   was breached and no lake developed as did     Crater Lake   in Oregon.   Mount Tehama's  main vent was probably what is now the park's  Sulphur Works .  Remnants of its caldera flanks are  Brokeoff Mountain ,  Mount Diller ,  Pilot Pinnacle , and  Mount Conrad .  Connect these peaks in a circle to envision  Mount Tehema's  base - more than 11 miles wide.                 Most Recent Activity              From: Hoblitt, Miller, and Scott, 1987, Volcanic Hazards with Regard to Siting Nuclear-Power Plants  in the Pacific Northwest: USGS Open-File Report 87-297       The  Lassen volcanic center   consists of a chain of vents aligned roughly north-south  that extends about 8 kilometers  north from Lassen Peak.   Although volcanism began at the center between about 600,000 and  350,000 years ago, events of the last 35,000 years are the most  thoroughly studied  and form the basis for assessing hazards from future eruptions in the region.        The most recent eruptive activity  occurred at Lassen Peak in     1914-1917 A.D. .   This eruptive episode began on May 30, 1914, when a small phreatic  eruption occurred at a new vent near the summit of the peak.   More than 150 explosions of various sizes  occurred during the following year.   By mid-May 1915, the eruption changed in character;  lava appeared in the summit crater and subsequently  flowed about 100 meters over the west and probably over  the east crater walls.   Disruption of the sticky lava on the upper east side of  Lassen Peak on May 19 resulted  in an avalanche of hot rock onto a snowfield.   A lahar was generated that reached more than 18 kilometers down  Lost Creek.  On May 22, an explosive  eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that devastated an  area as far as 6 kilometers northeast of the summit.  The  eruption also generated lahars that traveled more than  20 kilometers down Lost Creek and floods that went down  Hat Creek.  A vertical  eruption column resulting from the pyroclastic eruption  rose to an altitude of more than 9 kilometers above the vent  and deposited a lobe of pumiceous tephra that can be traced as far  as 30 kilometers to the east-northeast  The fall of fine ash was  reported as far away as Elko Nevada,  more than 500 kilometers east of Lassen Peak.   Intermittent eruptions of  variable intensity continued until about the middle of 1917.                MORE Lassen Peak 1914-1917 Eruption Information                Future Eruptions ???           From: Clynne, et.al., 2000, Volcano Hazards of the Lassen Volcanic National Park Area, California: USGS Fact Sheet 022-00       Because geologically recent volcanic activity in an area is the best guide to forecasting future eruptions, scientists study the lava flows, ash, and other deposits from past eruptions.  Volcanoes in the Lassen area tend to erupt infrequently, and may be inactive for periods lasting centuries or even millennia.  The most recent eruptions in the Lassen area were the relatively small events that occurred at Lassen Peak between 1914 and 1917.  The most recent large eruption produced  Chaos Crags  about 1,100 years ago.  Such large eruptions in the Lassen area have an average recurrence interval of about 10,000 years.  However, the geologic history of the Lassen area indicates that volcanism there is episodic, having periods of relatively frequent eruptions separated by long quiet intervals.  For example, the last large event before Chaos Crags eruption was the one that built Lassen Peak 27,000 years ago.                   Geologic Region               From: Miller, 1989,  Potential Hazards from Future Volcanic Eruptions in California: U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1847                Lassen Peak Region:               Lava Flows:  Produced at least one small lava flow in    A.D. 1915 .       Domes:  At least eight silicic domes within the last 12,000 years,  four between approximately 12,000 and 11,000 years,  three approximately 1,000 years ago, and one approximately 350 years ago.        Tephra Eruptions:  Tephra eruption approximately 1,100 years ago.       Pyroclastic Flows:  Two pyroclastic flows between approximately 12,000 and 11,000 years ago, three pyroclastic flows approximately 1,100 years ago, and  two pyroclastic flows approximately 300 years ago.       Directed Blasts:  Two small directed blasts (or pyroclastic flows) in A.D.1915 - effects extend to a distance of 5 kilometers from the summit.       Debris Flows:  Dozens of debris flows were generated during eruptions of Lassen Peak dome approximately 11,000 years ago, several debris avalanches approximately 300 years ago, and two small debris flows in A.D. 1915.               Lassen Peak Region Basalt Field:              Eruption of more than 20 center producing lava flows and (or) cinder cones during the last 10,000 years ... Small volumes of mafic tephra erupted at many centers during Holocene time.  Around 80 square kilometers covered with fine ash from   Cinder Cone  about 400 years ago.                 Hydrothermal Activity           From: U.S. National Park Service,  Lassen Volcanic National Park Website, March 2002         In May 1914 Lassen Peak    burst into eruption, beginning a seven-year cycle of sporadic volcanic outbursts. The climax      of this episode took place in 1915, when the peak blew an enormous mushroom cloud some seven miles into the      stratosphere. The reawakening of this volcano, which began as a vent on a larger extinct volcano known as Tehama,      profoundly altered the surrounding landscape.        The area was made a     National Park in 1916    because of its significance as an active volcanic landscape. The park is a      compact laboratory of volcanic phenomena and     associated thermal features (except true geysers) .   It is part of a vast      geographic unit - a great lava plateau with isolated volcanic peaks - that also encompasses      Lava Beds National Monument, California , and     Crater Lake National Park, Oregon .      Before the     1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens in Washington ,   Lassen Peak was the most recent volcanic outburst in      the contiguous 48 states. The peak is the southernmost volcano in the Cascade Range, which extends from here into      Canada. The western part of the park features great lava pinnacles (huge mountains created by lava flows), jagged      craters, and steaming sulphur vents. It is cut by spectacular glaciated canyons and is dotted and threaded by lakes and      rushing clear streams. Snowbanks persist year-round and beautiful meadows are spread with wildflowers in spring. The      eastern part of the park is a vast lava plateau more than one mile above sea level. Here are found small cinder cones      (Fairfield Peak, Hat Mountain, and Crater Butte). Forested with pine and fir, this area is studded with small lakes,      but it boasts few streams.  Warner Valley, marking the southern edge of the Lassen Plateau, features hot spring areas      (Boiling Springs Lake, Devils Kitchen, and Terminal Geyser) . This forested, steep valley also has gorgeous large      meadows. ...     Lassen geothermal area - Sulphur Works, Bumpass Hell (largest), Little Hot Springs Valley, Boiling Springs      Lake, Devils Kitchen, and Terminal Geyser  - offer bubbling mud pots, steaming fumaroles, and boiling water. Some      of these thermal features are getting hotter. Scientists think that Lassen Park and Mount Shasta are the most likely      candidates in the Cascades to join Mount Saint Helens as active volcanoes.            From: Schulz, Paul E., 1981 Revision, Road Guide to Lassen Volcanic National Park: Published in cooperation with the National Park Service, Copyright 1968  by the Loomis Museum Association.

Slippery clay and thin crusty coverings could lead to a dunking in 195 degree F (76 degrees C) water and mud.  Most water in the thermal areas of the park contains sulphurous or sulphuric acid ... The odor is mainly that of hydrogen sulphide.  Much of the white clay is tinted yellow, tan, or pink by minerals, chiefly iron oxides.                Volcano and Hydrologic Monitoring             From: Clynne, et.al., 2000, Volcano Hazards of the Lassen Volcanic National Park Area, California: USGS Fact Sheet 022-00         What is being done to monitor the Lassen volcanic center?      After the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  intensified its monitoring of active and potentially active volcanoes in the Cascade Range. Monitoring of the Lassen  area includes periodic measurements of ground deformation and volcanic-gas emissions and continuous transmission of  data from a local network of nine seismometers to USGS offices in Menlo Park, California. Should indications of  a significant increase in volcanic activity be detected, the USGS will immediately deploy scientists and specially designed  portable monitoring instruments to evaluate the threat. In addition, the National Park Service (NPS) has developed  an emergency response plan that would be activated to protect the public in the event of an impending eruption.             From: Iwatsubo, et.al., 1988, Measurements of slope distances and zenith angles at Newberry and South Sister volcanoes, Oregon, 1985-1986:  USGS Open-File Report 88-377, 51p.         Between 1980 and 1984, the U.S. Geological Survey's David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) established baseline geodetic networks at     Mount Baker ,     Mount Rainer , and     Mount St. Helens  in Washington,     Mount Hood  and     Crater Lake  in Oregon, and     Mount Shasta  and     Lassen Peak  in California.    To this list of potentially active volcanoes, CVO extended its monitoring program in 1985 to include     Newberry  and      South Sister    volcanoes in central Oregon.  The Newberry and South Sister networks were re-measured in 1986 and will be measured periodically in future years.  Improvements since 1984 in the recording of endpoint and flightline temperatures resulted in better overall data than obtained previously.  The improvements included: calibration of all the sensors and precision thermistors, installation of a new recording system for flightline data, and recording of endpoint temperatures 6 meters above ground level.  The data collected in 1985 and 1986 indicate little or no apparent deformation at either volcano between surveys.

The climax of the episode took place in 1915, when the peak blew an enormous mushroom cloud some seven miles into the stratosphere.  The reawakening of this volcano, which began as a vent on a larger extinct volcano known as  Tehama , profoundly altered the surrounding landscape.       The area was made a National Park in 1916   because of its significance as an active volcanic landscape.  The park is a compact laboratory of volcanic phenomena and associated    thermal features    (except true geysers). It is part of a vast geographic unit - a great     lava plateau   with isolated volcanic peaks - that also encompasses    Lava Beds National Monument (California)  and    Crater Lake National Park (Oregon) .

Clynne           The development of Chaos Crags forms a typical silicic volcanic cycle.  The deposits originating from Chaos Crags indicate a complex eruption 1,100-1,000 years ago.  Initial activity included formation of a tephra cone, emplacement of two pyroclastic flows, and growth of a dome that plugged the vent. After a quiet interval of approximately 70 years, the dome was destroyed by a violent eruption that emplaced a pyroclastic flow and an air-fall tephra lobe.  These deposits are best seen in the drainages of Manzanita and Lost Creeks within 10 kilometers of the Chaos Crags.  This violent eruption was followed by the growth of 5 domes, 3 of which had hot,  dome-collapse avalanches.  Chaos Jumbles formed 700 years later when one of the domes collapsed in a series of 3 cold rockfall-avalanches.       -- Excerpt from: Wood and Kienle, 1990, Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada: Cambridge University Press, 354p., p.216-219,  Contribution by Michael A.

The Chaos Jumbles      area looks similarly destroyed, but for a different reason. An air-cushioned avalanche - one that fell so rapidly en masse      that it trapped and compressed air beneath itself - crashed down the Chaos Crags about 300 years ago. The air acted      as a lubricant, enabling the avalanche to rush across the valley at more than 100 miles per hour. It pushed 400 feet up the      side of Table Mountain, before losing its momentum and surging back down across Manzanita Creek.       -- Excerpt from: U.S. National Park Service, Lassen Volcano National Park Website, March 2002                            Cinder Cone                    Three episodes of volcanism have occurred at the Lassen volcanic center in the past 1,100 years.

Its age has been controversial since the 1870's, when many people thought it was only a few decades old.  Later, the cone and associated lava flows were thought to have formed about A.D. 1700 or during a 300-year-long series of eruptions ending in 1851.  However, recent studies by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists, working in cooperation with the National Park Service to better understand volcanic hazards in the Lassen area, have firmly establised that Cinder Cone was formed in eruptions about 1650.       -- Excerpt from: Clynne, et.al., 2000, How Old is ""Cinder Cone""? -- Solving a Mystery in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California: USGS Fact Sheet 023-00         Cinder Cone is a 700-foot-high cone of loose scoria.  Scoria forms when blobs of gas-charged lava are thrown into the air during an eruption and cool in flight, falling as dark volcanic rock containing cavities created by trapped gas bubbles.  The summit of Cinder Cone has a crater with a double rim, probably created by fluctuating eruptive activity late in its formation.  The cone also has several associated blocky lava flows, and a realted, wide-spread ash deposit identifiable for 8 to 10 miles from the cone.      -- Excerpt from: Clynne, et.al., 2000, How Old is ""Cinder Cone""? -- Solving a Mystery in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California: USGS Fact Sheet 023-00          There are actually two scoria cones at Cinder Cone -- the remnants of a nearly completely buried earlier cone can be seen on the large cone's south side.  Much of the earlier cone was probably destroyed by lava flows erupting from its base.

These mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called  lava domes, were created by eruptions of lava too viscous to readily flow away from its source.   Eruptions about 27,000 years ago formed Lassen Peak,  probably within only a few years.  With a height of 2,000 feet  and a volume of half a cubic mile, it is one of the largest lava domes on Earth.     -- Excerpt from: Clynne, et.al., 1999, Eruptions of Lassen Peak, California, 1914 to 1917: USGS Fact Sheet 173-98           When Lassen Peak formed, it looked much like the nearby 1,100-year-old  Chaos Crags Domes, with steep sides covered with angular rock talus.  However, from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, during the last ice age, Lassen's shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion.  For example, the bowl-shaped depression on the volcano's northeastern flank, called a circue, was eroded by a glacier that extended out 7 miles from the dome.      -- Excerpt from: Clynne, et.al., 1999, Eruptions of Lassen Peak, California, 1914 to 1917: USGS Fact Sheet 173-98           The second and third sequences of lavas at the Lassen volcanic center comprise the dacite dome field.

Rocks of this sequence form the northern and western portions of the dacite dome field, and their vents are concentrated in linear chains near the inferred western edge of the old caldera.  The most prominent features of this sequence are  Eagle Peak (55,000 years ago), Sunflower Flat domes (35,000 years ago),  Lassen Peak (approximately 25,000 years ago), and  Chaos Crags (1,050 years ago).       -- Excerpt from: Wood and Kienle, 1990, Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada: Cambridge University Press, 354p., p.216-219,  Contribution by Michael A.

Brantley       Introduction   Volcanoes and the Theory of Plate Tectonics   Recent Eruptions from U.S. Volcanoes    Hawaiian volcanoes   Cascade volcanoes   Alaskan volcanoes   Restless calderas    Active Volcanoes: Windows into the Past   Glossary   Further Reading      Introduction  Few natural forces are as spectacular and threatening, or have played such a dominant role in shaping the face of the Earth, as erupting volcanoes. Volcanism has built some of the world's greatest mountain ranges, covered vast regions with lava (molten rock at the Earth's surface), and triggered explosive eruptions whose size and power are nearly impossible for us to imagine today. Fortunately, such calamitous eruptions occur infrequently. Of the 50 or so volcanoes that erupt every year, however, a few severely disrupt human activities. Between 1980 and 1990, volcanic activity killed at least 26,000 people and forced nearly 450,000 to flee from their homes.   Though few people in the United States may actually experience an erupting volcano, the evidence for earlier volcanism is preserved in many rocks of North America. Features seen in volcanic rocks only hours old are also present in ancient volcanic rocks, both at the surface and buried beneath younger deposits. A thick ash deposit sandwiched between layers of sandstone in Nebraska, the massive granite peaks of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, and a variety of volcanic layers found in eastern Maine are but a few of the striking clues of past volcanism. With this perspective, an erupting volcano is not only an exciting and awesome spectacle in its own right but a window into a natural process that has happened over and over again throughout Earth's history.   The Earth's crust, on which we live and depend, is in large part the product of millions of once-active volcanoes and tremendous volumes of magma (molten rock below ground) that did not erupt but instead cooled below the surface. Such persistent and widespread volcanism has resulted in many valuable natural resources throughout the world. For example, volcanic ash blown over thousands of square kilometers of land increases soil fertility for forests and agriculture by adding nutrients and acting as a mulch. Groundwater heated by large, still-hot magma bodies can be tapped for geothermal energy. And over many thousands of years, heated groundwater has concentrated valuable minerals, including copper, tin, gold, and silver, into deposits that are mined throughout the world.   The United States ranks third, behind Indonesia and Japan, in the number of historically active volcanoes (that is, those for which we have written accounts of eruptions). In addition, about 10 percent of the more than 1,500 volcanoes that have erupted in the past 10,000 years are located in the United States. Most of these volcanoes are found in the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest; the remainder are widely distributed in the western part of the Nation. A few U.S. volcanoes have produced some of the largest and most dangerous types of eruptions in this century, while several others have threatened to erupt.   Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) engage in a variety of research activities in order to reduce the loss of life and property that can result from volcanic eruptions and to minimize the social and economic turmoil that can result when volcanoes threaten to erupt. These activities include studies of the physical processes before, during, and after a volcanic eruption, assessments of volcano hazards, and public outreach to translate scientific information about volcanoes into terms that are meaningful to the public and public officials.   Monitoring volcanoes for signs of activity, another vital component, is carried out by USGS earth scientists at three volcano observatories, which were established to study active volcanoes in Hawaii (1912), the Cascades (1980), and Alaska (1988). These  researchers record earthquakes, survey the surfaces of volcanoes, map volcanic rock deposits, and analyze the chemistry of volcanic gas and fresh lava to detect warning signs of impending activity and determine the most likely type of activity that will affect areas around a volcano. During the past 10 years, several warnings of eruptions were issued by the USGS and monitoring of recently active volcanoes in the United States was expanded. Predicting the time and size of volcanic eruptions, however, remains a difficult challenge for scientists.    Volcanoes and the Theory of Plate Tectonics   Volcanoes are not randomly distributed over the Earth's surface. Most are concentrated on the edges of continents, along island chains, or beneath the sea forming long mountain ranges. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level encircle the Pacific Ocean to form the circum-Pacific ""Ring of Fire."" In the past 25 years, scientists have developed a theory--called plate tectonics--that explains the locations of volcanoes and their relationship to other large-scale geologic features.   According to this theory, the Earth's surface is made up of a patchwork of about a dozen large plates that move relative to one another at speeds from less than one centimeter to about ten centimeters per year (about the speed at which fingernails grow). These rigid plates, whose average thickness is about 80 kilometers, are spreading apart, sliding past each other, or colliding with each other in slow motion on top of the Earth's hot, pliable interior. Volcanoes tend to form where plates collide or spread apart, but they can also grow in the middle of a plate, as for example the Hawaiian volcanoes.    Recent Eruptions from U.S. Volcanoes    Hawaiian volcanoes   Few places on Earth allow closer or more dramatic views of volcanic activity than Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes on the island of Hawaii. Their frequent but usually nonexplosive eruptions make them ideal for scientific study. Kilauea's eruptions are so intensely monitored that scientists have assembled a detailed picture of the volcano's magma reservoir ""plumbing"" system and how it behaves before and during eruptions. Studies of these volcanoes and the surrounding ocean floor continue to improve our understanding of the geologic history of the Hawaiian Island chain and the ability of scientists to determine volcanic hazards that threaten island residents.   Eruptions of Hawaiian volcanoes are typically non-explosive because of the composition of the magma. Almost all of the magma erupted from Hawaii's volcanoes forms dark gray to black volcanic rock (called basalt), generally in the form of lava flows and, less commonly, as fragmented lava such as volcanic bombs, cinders, pumice, and ash. Basalt magma is more fluid than the other types of magma (andesite, dacite, and rhyolite). Consequently, expanding volcanic gases can escape from basalt relatively easily and can propel lava high into the air, forming brilliant fountains sometimes called ""curtains of fire.""   Lava, whether erupted in high fountains or quietly pouring out, collects to form flows that spread across the ground in thin broad sheets or in narrow streams. The fluid nature of basalt magma allows it to travel great distances from the vent (the place where lava breaks ground) and tends to build volcanoes in the shape of an inverted warrior shield, with slopes less than about 10 degrees. Volcanoes with this kind of profile are called shield volcanoes.   Hawaiian volcanoes erupt at their summit calderas and from their flanks along linear rift zones that extend from the calderas. Calderas are large steep-walled depressions that form when a volcano's summit region collapses, usually after a large eruption empties or partly empties a reservoir of magma beneath the volcano. Rift zones are areas of weakness within a volcano that extend from the surface to depths of several kilometers. Magma that erupts from the flank of a volcano must first flow underground through one of the volcano's rift zones, sometimes traveling more than 30 kilometers from the summit magma reservoir before breaking the surface.     Mauna Loa.  Rising more than 9,000 meters from the seafloor, Mauna Loa is one of the world's largest active volcanoes; from its base below sea level to its summit, Mauna Loa is taller than Mount Everest. It has erupted 15 times since 1900, with eruptions lasting from less than 1 day to as many as 145 days.   The most recent eruption began before dawn on March 25, 1984. Brilliant lava fountains lit the night-time sky as fissures opened across the floor of the caldera. Within hours, the summit activity stopped and lava began erupting from a series of vents along the northeast rift zone. When the eruption stopped 3 weeks later, lava flows were only 6.5 kilometers from buildings in the city of Hilo. Mauna Loa erupts less frequently than Kilauea, but it produces a much greater volume of lava over a shorter period of time.    Kilauea Volcano.  Kilauea's longest rift-zone eruption in historical time began on January 3, 1983. A row of lava fountains broke out from its east rift zone about 17 kilometers from the summit caldera; within a few months, the activity settled down to a single vent. Powerful fountaining episodes hurled molten rock 450 meters into  the air and built a cone of lava fragments that quickly became the tallest landmark on the rift zone.   The eruption changed style abruptly in July 1986 when lava broke out through a new vent. Instead of regular episodes of high lava fountaining, lava spilled continuously onto Kilauea's surface. The steady outpouring of lava formed a lake of molten rock that became perched atop a small shield volcano. By June 1991, the shield was about 60 meters tall and 1,600 meters in diameter, and lava from the eruption had covered 75 square kilometers of forest and grassland, added 120 hectares of new land to the island, and destroyed 179 homes.    Although most of Kilauea's historical rift eruptions were much briefer, prolonged eruptive activity in the east rift zone from 1969 to 1974 formed a similar shield, Mauna Ulu (Hawaiian for ""Growing Mountain""), and an extensive lava field on the volcano's south flank. The geologic record shows that such large-volume eruptions from the rift zones and the summit area, covering large parts of Kilauea's surface, have occurred many times in the recent past. In fact, about 90 percent of Kilauea's surface is covered with lava flows that are less than 1,100 years old.   Most eruptions at Kilauea can be viewed at close range, but a few historical eruptions were dangerously explosive. Fast-moving mixtures of ash and gas, called pyroclastic surges, raced across the summit area and into the southwest rift zone during an eruption in 1790. Footprints preserved in a layer of ash 30 kilometers southwest of the summit probably include those of a party of Hawaiian warriors and their families who were crossing the volcano when the eruption struck. An estimated 80 of the 250 people were killed by suffocating clouds associated with the pyroclastic surges. A smaller explosive eruption in 1924 from Halemaumau Crater in Kilauea summit caldera, which killed a photographer who was too close, hurled rocks weighing as much as 8 tons as far as 1 kilometer.      Cascade volcanoes    Volcanoes of the Cascade Range erupt far less frequently than Kilauea and Mauna Loa, but they are more dangerous because of their violently explosive behavior and their proximity to populated and cultivated areas in Washington, Oregon, and California. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in southwest Washington dramatically illustrated the type of volcanic activity and destruction these volcanoes can produce. Scientific studies of the eruption of Mount St. Helens and the eruptive histories of other Cascade volcanoes continue to improve public awareness and understanding of these potentially dangerous peaks.   In contrast to Kilauea, Cascade volcanoes erupt a variety of magma types that generate a wide range of eruptive behavior and build steepsided cones known as composite volcanoes. In addition to basalt, andesite and dacite magmas are common.  These magmas are so highly viscous, or sticky, that expanding volcanic gases cannot easily escape from them. This causes a tremendous build-up in pressure, often leading to extremely explosive eruptions. During such eruptions, magma is shattered into tiny fragments (chiefly ash and pumice) and ejected thousands of meters into the atmosphere or even the stratosphere. Under the force of gravity, sometimes these fragments sweep down a volcano's flanks at speeds of more than 100 kilometers per hour, mixing with air and volcanic gases to form pyroclastic flows. Rock fragments can also mix with water in river valleys to form lahars (volcanic debris flows and mudflows) that destroy everything in their paths.   Andesite and dacite magmas also erupt to form lava flows. Because these lavas are more viscous (""stickier"") than basalt, they tend to form thicker flows that travel shorter distances from the vent; consequently, andesite and dacite lavas typically build tall cones with steep slopes of more than 20 degrees.     Mount Baker, Washington.  Eyewitness reports of small ashy plumes and active steam vents on Mount Baker dating as far back as the mid-1800's were clear evidence that the ice-covered volcano had one of the most active geothermal systems among Cascade volcanoes. When new fumaroles and unusually dark vapor plumes appeared abruptly in March 1975, however, people in the Northwest became concerned about an impending eruption and possible avalanches and lahars from Sherman Crater, a vent just south of Mount Baker's summit. Despite a tenfold increase in the release of heat by the volcano during the next 12 months, which resulted in extensive changes to the ice cover in Sherman Crater and produced minor releases of ash, no eruption occurred. The thermal activity was not accompanied by earthquakes, which generally precede most eruptions, and since 1976, the volcano has not showed additional signs of activity.   The increased thermal activity between 1975 and 1976 prompted public officials and Puget Power to temporarily close public access to the popular Baker Lake recreation area and to lower the reservoir's water level by 10 meters. Significant avalanches of debris from the Sherman Crater area could have swept directly into the reservoir, triggering a disastrous wave that would have caused loss of life and damage to the reservoir.     Mount Rainier, Washington.  Mount Rainier has not produced a significant eruption in the past 500 years, but scientists consider it to be one of the most hazardous volcanoes in the Cascades. Mount Rainier has 26 glaciers containing more than five times as much snow and ice as all the other Cascade volcanoes combined. If only a small part of this ice were melted by volcanic activity, it would yield enough water to trigger enormous lahars.   Mount Rainier's potential for generating destructive mudflows is enhanced by its great height above surrounding valleys and its ""soft"" interior. The volcano stands about 3,000 meters above river valleys leading from its base. Volcanic heat and ground water have turned some of the volcano's originally hard lava into soft clay minerals, thereby weakening its internal structure. These conditions make Mount Rainier extremely susceptible to large landslides. Several have occurred in the past few thousand years, one as recently as about 600 years ago. These landslides, apparently containing great volumes of water, quickly turned into lahars as they rushed down river valleys.    Mount St. Helens, Washington.  The catastrophic eruption on May 18, 1980, was preceded by 2 months of intense activity that included more than 10,000 earthquakes, hundreds of small phreatic (steam-blast) explosions, and the outward growth of the volcano's entire north flank by more than 80 meters. A magnitude 5.1 earthquake struck beneath the volcano at 08:32 on May 18, setting in motion the devastating eruption.   Within seconds of the earthquake, the volcano's bulging north flank slid away in the largest landslide in recorded history, triggering a destructive, lethal lateral blast of hot gas, steam, and rock debris that swept across the landscape as fast as 1,100 kilometers per hour. Temperatures within the blast reached as high as 300 degrees Celsius. Snow and ice on the volcano melted, forming torrents of water and rock debris that swept down river valleys leading from the volcano. Within minutes, a massive plume of ash thrust 19 kilometers into the sky, where the prevailing wind carried about 490 tons of ash across 57,000 square kilometers of the Western United States.   The well-documented landslide at Mount St. Helens has helped geologists to recognize more than 200 similar deposits at other volcanoes in the world, including several other Cascade peaks. Geologists now realize that large landslides from volcanoes are far more common than previously thought--seventeen such volcanic landslides have occurred worldwide in the past 400 years. Consequently, when scientists evaluate the types of volcanic activity that may endanger people, giant landslides are now included, in addition to other types of volcanic activity such as lava flows, pyroclastic flows, lahars, and falling ash.   Following the 1980 explosive eruption, more than a dozen extrusions of thick, pasty lava built a mound-shaped lava dome in the new crater. The dome is about 1,100 meters in diameter and 250 meters tall.    Lassen Peak, California.  Long before the recent activity of Mount St. Helens, a series of spectacular eruptions from Lassen Peak between 1914 and 1917 demonstrated the explosive potential of Cascade volcanoes. Small phreatic explosions began on May 30, 1914, and were followed during the next 12 months by more than 150 explosions that sent clouds of ash as high as 3 kilometers above the peak. The activity changed character in May 1915, when a lava flow was observed in the summit crater. A deep red glow from the hot lava was visible at night 34 kilometers away. On May 19, an avalanche of hot rocks from the lava spilled onto snow and triggered a lahar that extended more than 15 kilometers from the volcano.   The most destructive explosion occurred on May 21, when a pyroclastic flow devastated forests as far as 6.5 kilometers northeast of the summit and lahars swept down several valleys radiating from the volcano. An enormous ash plume rose more than 9 kilometers above the peak, and the prevailing winds scattered the ash across Nevada as far as 500 kilometers to the east. Lassen Peak continued to produce smaller eruptions until about the middle of 1917.     Alaskan volcanoes   The Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands have about 80 major volcanic centers that consist of one or more volcanoes. Recent violent eruptions have demonstrated that volcanic hazards do exist in some areas of Alaska, even though it is sparsely populated. Alaskan volcanoes have produced one or two eruptions per year since 1900. At least 20 catastrophic caldera-forming eruptions have occurred in the past 10,000 years; the awesome eruption of 1912 at Novarupta in the Katmai National Monument is the most recent. Scientists are particularly concerned about the volcanoes whose eruptions can affect the Cook Inlet region, where 60 percent of Alaska's population lives.    Redoubt Volcano.  Redoubt Volcano erupted for the fourth time this century on December 14, 1989. Following several days of strong explosive activity, a series of lava domes grew in Redoubt's summit crater during the next four months. Most of the domes were destroyed by explosions or collapsed down the volcano's north flank. Some of these events triggered small pyroclastic flows that melted snow and ice on the volcano to form lahars in Drift River Valley, which empties into Cook Inlet 35 kilometers away.   Ash produced by the eruptions severely affected air traffic enroute to Anchorage, Alaska's largest city and a major hub of domestic and international commercial air traffic. Many domestic carriers suspended service to Alaska following major explosive events, and several international carriers temporarily rerouted flights around Alaska. On December 15, a jetliner enroute to Japan encountered an ash cloud while descending into Anchorage. The plane quickly lost power in all four engines and lost 4,000 meters in altitude before the pilots were able to restart the engines. The aircraft landed safely in Anchorage, but it sustained more than $80 million in damage.   Lahars generated during the eruption threatened an oil-storage facility located on the banks of Drift River. Oil is pumped from more than a dozen wells in Cook Inlet to the facility and then loaded onto tankers, which dock just offshore. A lahar on January 2 flooded part of the facility with nearly a meter of water, forcing its shutdown until workers could restore power. This and subsequent lahars prompted the Cook Inlet Pipeline Company to temporarily halt oil production from some oil wells and reduce the amount of oil stored at the facility between tanker loadings.    Augustine Volcano.  One of the most active volcanoes in Cook Inlet is Augustine, whose symmetrical cone rises 1,254 meters above the sea. Since Captain James Cook discovered and named it in 1778, Augustine has erupted in 1812, 1883, 1935, 1963-64, 1976, and 1986. Curiously, the quiet intervals between these eruptions apparently have shortened from 70 to 10 years.   Augustine's 1986 eruption was similar to the pattern of events observed in 1976. After eight months of earthquake activity beneath the volcano, a violent explosion began on March 26. Billowing ash plumes rose more than 10 kilometers above the vent, pyroclastic flows sped down the volcano's flanks into the sea, and ash spread throughout Cook Inlet. A second stage began April 23, when lava began erupting near the volcano's summit and added about 25 meters to the top of the existing lava dome. Small pyroclastic flows accompanied growth of the dome.   Scientists were worried that this eruption might trigger a giant landslide from Augustine's steep upper cone, which could enter the sea to create a tsunami (powerful seismic sea wave). At least 12 landslides are known to have occurred at Augustine. The most recent slide took place at the onset of the 1883 eruption when a part of the volcano's summit collapsed into the sea. Within one hour, a tsunami as high as 9 meters crashed ashore on the coast of the Kenai Peninsula 80 kilometers away. No one was killed and property damage was only minor because the tsunami hit at low tide. Subsequent eruptions have rebuilt a steep cone of overlapping lava domes similar to the cone that existed just before the 1883 landslide.    Novarupta, Katmai National Monument.  The largest eruption in the world this century occurred in 1912 at Novarupta on the Alaska Peninsula. An estimated 15 cubic kilometers of magma was explosively erupted during 60 hours beginning on June 6-- about 30 times the volume erupted by Mount St. Helens in 1980! The expulsion of such a large volume of magma excavated a funnel-shaped vent 2 kilometers wide and triggered the collapse of Mount Katmai volcano 10 kilometers away to form a summit caldera 600 meters deep and about 3 kilometers across. Extrusion of the lava dome, called Novarupta, near the center of the 1912 vent marked the end of the eruption.   Little was known about the spectacular effects of this great eruption until 1916, when a scientific expedition sponsored by the National Geographic Society visited the area. To their amazement, they found a broad valley northwest of Novarupta marked by a flat plain of loose, ""sandy"" ash material from which thousands of jets of steam were hissing. The eruption had produced pyroclastic flows that swept about 21 kilometers down the upper Ukak River valley. The thickness of the resulting pumice and ash deposits in the upper valley is not known but may be as great as 200 meters. In 1916, the deposits were still hot enough to boil water and form countless steaming fumaroles; hence the expedition named this part of the Ukak River the ""Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.""    Trident Volcano.  Eruptions of andesitic lava flows between 1953 and 1960 built a new cone on Trident's southwest flank, adding yet another to the volcano's older complex of three overlapping cones (hence the name Trident). A huge cloud of rising ash was seen on February 15, 1953, in the direction of Katmai National Monument; 3 days later clear weather permitted U.S. Navy pilots to spot a blocky lava flow emerging from Trident's southwest flank. Slow extrusion of lava during the next 4 months built an irregularly shaped lava dome about 1.5 kilometers long and 600 meters tall. Trident continued to erupt intermittently through 1960, generating three lava flows as long as 4.5 kilometers from the same vent and numerous ash-producing explosive eruptions.    Mount Veniaminof.  Mount Veniaminof is a massive composite volcano with a summit caldera about 8 kilometers in diameter. Since its formation about 3,700 years ago, the caldera has filled with ice to a depth of at least 60 meters. Between June 1983 and January 1984, a series of small explosions, lava fountains, and lava flows erupted from a small cinder cone within the caldera. The explosions hurled molten lava from the cinder cone, and lava flows melted a pit about 1.5 kilometers in diameter in the ice near the base of the volcano. Water from the melting ice formed a temporary lake.    Mount Spurr.  The summit cone of Mount Spurr consists of a large lava dome built in the center of a horseshoe-shaped crater formed earlier by a large landslide. At the southern edge of this ancient crater is a younger, more active cone known as Crater Peak. Scientists have determined that Crater Peak is the source for at least 35 ash layers found in the Cook Inlet area, all of which were erupted in the past 6,000 years. Until recently, a warm turquoise-colored lake partially filled its crater.   A series of explosive eruptions from Crater Peak on June 27, 1992, generated ash plumes as high as about 14 kilometers, small pyroclastic flows that swept down the south and east sides of the cone, and small lahars. The reawakening of Crater Peak followed nearly a year of increased earthquake activity, which escalated further on June 26, less than 1 day before its first eruption. Not all of the explosive episodes were preceded by a change in seismicity beneath the volcano, a condition that required scientists to maintain a 24-hour watch for extended periods of time in order to issue sudden reports and warnings of eruptive activity. The west side of Cook Inlet received a light to moderate ashfall during the largest explosive episode on August 18; Anchorage was blanketed with about 3 millimeters of ash, causing the Anchorage International Airport to close for a few hours. During an eruption at night on September 17, a spectacular display of lightning and incandescent ballistics and pyroclastic flows were witnessed by hunters who camped about 18 kilometers to the southeast; a faint glow above Crater Peak was also visible from as far away as Anchorage.     Restless calderas   The largest and most explosive volcanic eruptions eject tens to hundreds of cubic kilometers of magma onto the Earth's surface. When such a large volume of magma is removed from beneath a volcano, the ground subsides or collapses into the emptied space, to form a huge depression called a caldera. Some calderas are more than 25 kilometers in diameter and several kilometers deep.   Calderas are among the most spectacular and active volcanic features on Earth. Earthquakes, ground cracks, uplift or subsidence of the ground, and thermal activity such as hot springs, geysers, and boiling mud pots are common at many calderas. Such activity is caused by complex interactions among magma stored beneath a caldera, ground water, and the regional buildup of stress in the large plates of the Earth's  crust. Significant changes in the level of activity at some calderas are common; these new activity levels can be intermittent, lasting for months to years, or persistent over decades to centuries. Although most caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, the possibility of violent explosive eruptions warrants detailed scientific study and monitoring of some active calderas.   Recently, scientists have recognized volcanic unrest at two calderas in the United States, Long Valley Caldera in eastern California and Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Whether unrest at these calderas simply punctuates long periods of quiet or is the early warning sign of future eruptions is an important but still unanswered question.     Long Valley Caldera, California.  Long Valley Caldera lies on the eastern front of the Sierra Nevada, about 300 kilometers east of San Francisco. A huge explosive eruption about 700,000 years ago formed the caldera and produced pyroclastic flows that traveled 65 kilometers from the vent and covered an area of about 1,500 square kilometers. Ash from the caldera-forming eruption fell as far east as Nebraska. Within the past 40,000 years, eruptions have been restricted to a linear zone of vents, including the Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Chain, that extends about 50 kilometers north from the northwest part of the caldera.   This volcanic chain consists of many vents that have erupted in the past several thousand years. Eruptions from vents as recently as 550 years ago produced lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and ash, all of rhyolitic composition. Geologic mapping shows that some eruptions were preceded by ground cracking, suggesting that the ground was pulled apart or stretched as magma neared the surface.   Three moderate earthquakes south of the caldera and one beneath the caldera on May 25-26, 1980, marked the beginning of unrest that continues into the 1990's. Swarms of earthquakes beneath the caldera, changes in several hot springs, and the formation of new springs have occurred since 1980. Precise surveys have also shown that the central part of the caldera has risen by more than 50 centimeters since 1975. This unrest is probably related to the stretching (east-west extension) of the Earth's crust that is known to be occurring in the region around the caldera, and it probably also involves the rise of magma beneath the caldera. Scientists do not know if this unrest will lead to volcanic activity, but the geologically recent eruptions along the Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Chain suggest that future eruptions are possible.    Yellowstone Caldera, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.  Yellowstone Caldera is one of the largest and most active calderas in the world. The spectacular geysers, boiling hot springs, and mud pots that have made Yellowstone famous--and even the strikingly beautiful Grand Canyon of Yellowstone through which the Yellowstone River plunges--owe their existence to the tremendous volcanic forces that have affected the region during the past 2 million years. Cataclysmic eruptions 2.0, 1.3, and 0.6 million years ago ejected huge volumes of rhyolite magma; each eruption formed a caldera and extensive layers of thick pyroclastic-flow deposits. The youngest caldera is an elliptical depression, nearly 80 kilometers long and 50 kilometers wide, that occupies much of Yellowstone National Park. The caldera is buried by several extensive rhyolite lava flows erupted between 75,000 and 150,000 years ago.   The Earth's crust beneath Yellowstone National Park is still restless. Precise surveys have detected an area in the center of the caldera that rose by as much as 86 centimeters between 1923 and 1984 and then subsided slightly between 1985 and 1989. Scientists do not know the cause of these ups and downs but hypothesize that they are related to the addition or withdrawal of magma beneath the caldera, or to the changing pressure of the hot ground water system above Yellowstone's large magma reservoir. Also, Yellowstone National Park and the area immediately west of the Park are historically among the most seismically active areas in the Rocky Mountains. Small-magnitude earthquakes are common beneath the entire caldera, but most are located along the Hebgen Lake fault zone that extends into the northwest part of the caldera. A magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred along this zone in 1959.    Active Volcanoes: Windows into the Past   Molten rock has erupted onto the surface of the Earth throughout its 4.5-billion-year history. Although many of these ancient rocks were removed by erosion, volcanic deposits can be found beneath younger rocks in many parts of the United States. To a geologist, such long-lasting volcanic rocks look like those formed by today's active volcanoes. Many ancient volcanic rocks, however, change somewhat with time, as they become firmly consolidated, buried by younger deposits, and sometimes folded and faulted by the continuous shifting of the Earth's crust. Even minerals of volcanic rocks may change, if after burial they encounter high pressures and temperatures.   Most active volcanoes are built on older volcanic deposits erupted from ancient volcanoes, and visitors to the present-day volcanoes walk or drive across these products of past volcanism. For example, anyone driving across the Cascade Range, sunbathing at Waikiki, or fishing on the Alaska Peninsula is there because old volcanic rocks form the landscape.   One step further back in time from today's active volcanoes are people who picnic in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, enjoy the autumn colors in the Blue Ridge of Shenandoah National Park, and hike in the rugged Big Bend National Park of Texas. Many of the rocks in these areas were formed by eruptions or by intrusion of magma into the Earth's crust many millions of years ago. Because volcanic activity has been so important in shaping the Earth, watching active volcanoes today provides a window through which we can glimpse and reconstruct the early volcanic history of our planet.   As we increase our knowledge about volcanic processes, by studying volcanoes erupting today as well as those that have lain dormant for hundreds to thousands of years, we increase our ability to predict when and how volcanoes will erupt. Accurate predictions, presented in terms that are meaningful to public officials, will minimize the number of lives lost and the social and economic upheaval that an eruption can cause.

GX018-69-11756464	Close Window                                Print              Version                                      Understanding                the Potential for Volcanoes at Yucca Mountain                                                                                                             By studying the rocks and geologic features of an area, experts                can assess whether it is vulnerable to future volcanic eruptions.                Scientists have performed extensive studies at and near Yucca Mountain                to determine whether future volcanoes could possibly affect the                proposed repository for nuclear waste.               What causes volcanoes?                The earth’s crust is broken into plates that resemble a giant                jigsaw puzzle. Our planet has 16 major plates. These rigid plates                sit on a layer of molten rock. As the plates move about, they slide                past each other, push together, or pull apart.                Most volcanoes occur near the edges of continental plates. In areas                where plates are moving apart, magma can come to the surface and                erupt. When plates push together, one plate will sometimes slide                beneath the other. If the plunging plate goes deep enough, some                of its rock melts and forms magma that can move upward and erupt                at the earth’s surface.               The “Pacific Ring of Fire” is an example of where volcanoes                are occurring along the edges of continental plates. Currently,                more than half of the world’s active volcanoes encircle the                Pacific Ocean. In the United States, most of these volcanoes are                in the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, the Hawaiian Islands,                and the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest.               In addition, there are a few areas on the earth called “hot                spots,” where magma has melted through the plate. Because                it is lighter than the solid rock around it, the magma rises and                collects in magma chambers. If water is nearby, the magma heats                the water, which sometimes erupts at the surface in the form of                geysers. “Old Faithful” in Yellowstone National Park                is a geyser resulting from a current hot spot. Under certain conditions                in a hot spot, magma can move through vents and fissures and erupt                at the earth’s surface. (Once on the surface, it is usually                called lava.)               Some volcanic eruptions are explosive, and others are not. The                explosiveness of an eruption depends on the consistency of the magma.                If the magma is thin and runny, gases can easily escape. When this                type of magma erupts, it flows gently from cracks in the earth’s                surface. If the magma is thick and sticky, gases cannot escape,                and pressure builds until the gases explode in a violent eruption.               Volcanoes: Past, present, and future                Volcanoes that are now extinct contributed significantly to the                formation of the earth’s crust. Over time, the cooling and                hardening of the earth’s crust has forever changed the conditions                under which these early volcanoes existed.               Smaller-scale volcanic activity will continue in vulnerable areas                such as hot spots or where continental plates meet.               Experts agree that future volcanism is more likely to occur within                or near areas where volcanoes have occurred in the past several                hundred thousand years. Using modern dating methods, experts can                determine when volcanoes occurred in a specific area.               Yucca Mountain's volcanic history                Millions of years ago, a series of large explosive volcanic eruptions                occurred to the north of Yucca Mountain. These eruptions produced                dense clouds of volcanic ash and rock fragments, which melted or                compressed together to create layers of rock called tuff, forming                the mountains and hills of the region.               The large-scale volcanic eruptions that produced Yucca Mountain                ended about 12 million years ago. This explosive volcanism produced                almost all (more than 99 percent) of the volcanic material in the                Yucca Mountain region.               Several million years ago, a different type of eruption began in                the area. These eruptions were smaller and much less explosive.                These small eruptions were marked by lava and cinders seeping and                sputtering from cones or fissures. The last such small eruption                occurred about 80,000 years ago. The remaining volcanic material                (less than 1 percent) in the Yucca Mountain region is a result of                these smaller eruptions.               Yucca Mountain is not in an area where continental plates meet,                nor is it located near any volcanic hot spots. In fact, experts                consider the Yucca Mountain region one of the least active volcanic                fields in the western United States.               Involving the world's top volcano experts in              studies of Yucca Mountain                 To assess the possibility of future volcanic activity in the Yucca                Mountain area, the U.S. Department of Energy relied upon careful                evaluation by some of the world’s foremost experts in such                fields as volcanology, geophysics, and geochemistry.               Their studies started with extensive analysis of the location,                age, and volume of past volcanic activity in the Yucca Mountain                area. Using the data from these studies, along with information                from studies of both modern and ancient volcanoes throughout the                world, the scientists performed a volcanic hazard analysis. 1  This                analysis evaluated the likelihood of magma entering the potential                repository area. The analysis also evaluated the possibility of                magma intersecting the repository and erupting up through the mountain’s                surface.               A panel of independent external experts continues to provide the                DOE with ongoing advice about volcanic hazards. This will help ensure                that a sound technical basis is presented in future licensing interactions                with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.               Could a future volcano disrupt a repository              at Yucca Mountain?                Using their extensive studies of the Yucca Mountain region, experts                estimate the chance of a volcanic event disrupting the proposed                repository to be about one in 63 million per year. This equals about                0.0000016 percent chance per year that a volcano will disrupt the                repository. Put another way, it means there is about a 99.9999984                percent chance per year that a volcanic event will  not                 disrupt the repository.               1.

GX037-60-9123119	"USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington                     Volcanic History of the  Lassen Volcanic National Park Region           Excerpt from: Clynne, et.al., 2000,   Volcano Hazards of the Lassen Volcanic National Park Area, California: USGS Fact Sheet 022-00              The Lassen region has been volcanically active for about 3 million years.  Lassen Peak and nearby volcanic domes are the most recently active parts of the Lassen ""volcanic center"", which began to erupt about 600,000 years ago.  From 600,000 to 400,000 yars ago, eruptions built a large conical volcano, often referred to as ""Brokeoff Volcano"" or ""Mount Tehama"", which was roughly the size of Mout St. Helens, Washington.  Later, this volcano became inactive and was mostly eroded away, leaving remnants that include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Diamond Peak.    Subsequent eruptions from the Lassen volcanic center have formed more than 30 steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called ""lava domes"".  Eruptions about 27,000 years ago formed Lassen Peak, one of the largest lava domes on Earth.  When Lassen Peak formed, it looked much like the nearby 1,100-year-old Chaos Crags domes, with steep sides covered by angular rock talus.  However, from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, during the last ice age, Lassen Peak's shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion.    Lassen Peak and its neighboring lava domes are not typical, conical ""stratovolcanoes"" like Mount Shasta or Mount Rainier.  Those large volcanoes were formed by repeated eruptions of lava and ash from a central summit vent over tens of thousands of years.  The Lassen dome field, in contrast, is an example of a volcanic area that erupts lava from numerous individual vents, each of which is active for a few years to a few decades and usually does not erupt again.    The composition of the molten rock (magma) that feeds volcanism in the Lassen area ranges widely in its content of silica (SiO 2 ).  When high-silica (dacite) magma rises to the Earth's surface, it can erupt explosively to produce ash clouds and pyroclastic flows.  Dacite magma extruded nonexplosively forms lava domes, because it is too viscous to flow far away from its source.  Low-silica (basalt) magma is more fluid and usually erupts less explosively than dacite magma.  Eruptions of basalt magma typically produce elongate lava flows, as well as build cinder cones (piles of small frothy lava fragments or ""cinders"") around volcanic vents.    In the past 50,000 years, at least seven major episodes of dacitic volcanism produced lava domes and pyroclastic deposits in the Lassen area, and another five episodes produced basaltic and andesitic (silica content between basalt and dacite) lava flows.  In addition, about 20 smaller volcanoes erupted basaltic lavas in the larger region surrounding the Lassen volcanic center.                         Return to:       [Report Menu]  ...

GX021-22-10357184	USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington        REPORT:   Volcanic Event Notification at Mount St. Helens      -- Myers, Bobbie, and Theisen, George J., 1994,  Volcanic Event Notification at Mount St. Helens: IN: Casadevall, Thomas J., (ed.), 1994, Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety: Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety: USGS Bulletin 2047, 450p., p.207-212.      Abstract   During the 1980-86 eruptions of Mount St. Helens, hazards information was quickly disseminated through a U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory - U.S. Forest Service notification system.  Written and verbal statements issued jointly by the Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) and University of Washington were released to the Forest Service for telephone call-down to governmental agencies and private interests.  Once the call-down was underway, public and media information tapes were updated and press releases were issued.  Because most of these eruptions had recognizable precursors, a series of information statements and eruption forecasts was issued during the weeks to hours before and eruption, thus providing advance warning of volcanic activity and associated hazards.    Hundreds of small gas and ash emissions also occurred during 1980-86, most without recognizable precursors.  The lack of precursors made advance warning of these events impossible; instead, information statements were issued after the larger, more visible events.  The occurrence of occasional small, unpredictable, ash-producing explosions at Mount St. Helens during 1989-91, coupled with increased concern about the hazards of volcanic ash to aviation, prompted CVO to develop a seismic-alarm system that triggers on small volcanic events.  This alarm system activates CVO's 24-hour telephone beeper.  In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) can also activate the CVO beeper to report possible volcanic activity.  These two modifications improve CVO's response time for non-predictable, sudden-onset events and help the FAA quickly verify pilot reports of possible volcanic plumes.

Ewert and Donald A. Swanson, (eds), 1992,  Monitoring Volcanoes: Techniques and Strategies Used by the Staff of the  Cascades Volcano Observatory, 1980-90: USGS Bulletin 1966, 223 p.            This bulletin marks the tenth anniversary of the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens by describing many of the monitoring techniques used since then to track the volcano's ongoing activity.  All the chapters in this volume were written by technicians and scientists who are now or were at some time in the past 10 years members of the Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO), which was established in Vancouver, Washington, in the summer of 1980 in response to the eruption of nearby Mount St. Helens.  The chapters in the bulletin describe the techniques and strategies employed by CVO's staff to collect data used to monitor volcanic activity and predict eruptive activity at Mount St. Helens, as well as other volcanoes in the United states, Latin America, and New Zealand.  The chapters focus on the methods for acquiring and managing data, not on the interpretations resulting from the data.  We anticipate that the audience of the bulletin will be those scientists and technicians, particularly in developing countries, who themselves are, or will be, monitoring volcanoes.  The bulletin is not intended to be a comprehensive text on volcano monitoring but instead a distillation of how CVO's staff responded both to the need to monitor an active composite volcano and to the dynamic technological developments during the 1980's.       -- Ewert and Swanson, (eds.), 1992                   In HTML Format          Introduction        Table of Contents     -- Includes Menus of all 21 Chapters            Other Menus of Interest         Mount St. Helens Monitoring Menu     -- CVO Menu        VDAP - Volcano Disaster Assistance Program Menu     -- CVO Menu        Volcano and Hydrologic Monitoring Menu     -- CVO Menu                      How To Order This or Other USGS Publications                         URL for CVO HomePage is:     <http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/home.html>     URL for this page is:  <http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Monitoring/Bulletin1966/framework.html>    If you have questions or comments please contact:   <GS-CVO-WEB@usgs.gov>    06/02/00, Lyn Topinka
GX021-18-9515894	"USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington        REPORT:  Volcanoes      -- Robert I. Tilling, 1985, Volcanoes: U.S. Geological Survey General Interest Publication       Introduction   Volcanoes destroy and volcanoes create. The catastrophic eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, made clear the awesome destructive power of a volcano. Yet, over a time span longer than human memory and record, volcanoes have played a key role in forming and modifying the planet upon which we live. More than 80 percent of the Earth's surface--above and below sea level--is of volcanic origin. Gaseous emissions from volcanic vents over hundreds of millions of years formed the Earth's earliest oceans and atmosphere, which supplied the ingredients vital to evolve and sustain life. Over geologic eons, countless volcanic eruptions have produced mountains, plateaus, and plains, which subsequent erosion and weathering have sculpted into majestic landscapes and formed fertile soils.     Ironically, these volcanic soils and inviting terranes have attracted, and continue to attract, people to live on the flanks of volcanoes. Thus, as population density increases in regions of active or potentially active volcanoes, mankind must become increasingly aware of the hazards and learn not to ""crowd"" the volcanoes. People living in the shadow of volcanoes must live in harmony with them and expect, and should plan for, periodic violent unleashings of their pent-up energy.     This booklet presents a generalized summary of the nature, workings, products, and hazards of the common types of volcanoes around the world, along with a brief introduction to the techniques of volcano monitoring and research.     On August 24, A.D. 79, Vesuvius Volcano suddenly exploded and destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Although Vesuvius had shown stir-rings of life when a succession`of earthquakes in A.D. 63 caused some damage, it had been literally quiet for hundreds of years and was considered ""extinct."" Its surface and crater were green and covered with vegetation, so the eruption was totally unexpected. Yet in a few hours, hot volcanic ash and dust buried the two cities so thoroughly that their ruins were not uncovered for nearly 1,700 years, when the discovery of an outer wall in 1748 started a period of modern archeology. Vesuvius has continued its activity intermittently ever since A.D 79 with numerous minor eruptions and several major eruptions occurring in 1631, 1794, 1872, 1906 and in 1944 in the midst of the Italian campaign of World War II.     In the United States on March 27, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano in the Cascade Range, southwestern Washington, reawakened after more than a century of dormancy and provided a dramatic and tragic reminder that there are active volcanoes in the ""lower 48"" States as well as in Hawaii and Alaska.The catastrophic eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, and related mudflows and flooding caused significant loss of life (57 dead or missing) and property damage over $1.2 billion). Mount St. Helens is expected to remain intermittently active for months or years, possibly even decades.     The word volcano comes from the little island of Vulcano in the Mediterranean Sea off Sicily. Centuries ago, the people living in this area believed that Vulcano was the chimney of the forge of Vulcan--the blacksmith of the Roman gods. They thought that the hot lava fragments and clouds of dust erupting from Vulcano came from Vulcan's forge as he beat out thunderbolts for Jupiter, king of the gods, and weapons for Mars, the god of war. In Polynesia the people attributed eruptive activity to the beautiful but wrathful Pele, Goddess of Volcanoes, whenever she was angry or spiteful. Today we know that volcanic eruptions are not super natural but can be studied and interpreted by scientists.           Return to:      [Report Menu]  ...

GX021-16-6914349	"USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington        REPORT:   Volcanic Event Notification at Mount St. Helens      -- Myers, Bobbie, and Theisen, George J., 1994,  Volcanic Event Notification at Mount St. Helens: IN: Casadevall, Thomas J., (ed.), 1994, Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety: Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety: USGS Bulletin 2047, 450p., p.207-212.        Abstract     During the 1980-86 eruptions of Mount St. Helens, hazards information was quickly disseminated through a U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory - U.S. Forest Service notification system.  Written and verbal statements issued jointly by the Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) and University of Washington were released to the Forest Service for telephone call-down to governmental agencies and private interests.  Once the call-down was underway, public and media information tapes were updated and press releases were issued.  Because most of these eruptions had recognizable precursors, a series of information statements and eruption forecasts was issued during the weeks to hours before and eruption, thus providing advance warning of volcanic activity and associated hazards.    Hundreds of small gas and ash emissions also occurred during 1980-86, most without recognizable precursors.  The lack of precursors made advance warning of these events impossible; instead, information statements were issued after the larger, more visible events.  The occurrence of occasional small, unpredictable, ash-producing explosions at Mount St. Helens during 1989-91, coupled with increased concern about the hazards of volcanic ash to aviation, prompted CVO to develop a seismic-alarm system that triggers on small volcanic events.  This alarm system activates CVO's 24-hour telephone beeper.  In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) can also activate the CVO beeper to report possible volcanic activity.  These two modifications improve CVO's response time for non-predictable, sudden-onset events and help the FAA quickly verify pilot reports of possible volcanic plumes.         Introduction     When Mount St. Helens awoke in March 1980, there was an immediate need for the rapid dissemination of information about volcanic events and hazards.  An emergency coordination center (ECC) was established at the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) facility in Vancouver, Washington.  The facility was staffed 24 hours a day by USFS personnel experienced with emergency response.  During critical times, the ECC was also staffed by representatives of the U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory, emergency management agencies, and private companies.  A communications network ( figure 1 ) and telephone call-down procedures were developed to facilitate rapid dissemination of information about the activity of the volcano.  Information was also disseminated through public meetings, press conferences, and briefings with governmental agencies and private businesses (Miller and others, 1981).  Written ""volcanic and seismic activity reports"" were issued daily.  These ""daily updates"" provided information on the status of the volcano and any significant changes or observations during the previous 24 hours.            Figure 1:                       Since 1980, this notification system has been modified in response to changes in volcanic activity, funding, and the concerns of government, business, and the public.  Key changes include the capability of issuing written predictions weeks in advance of most eruptions; eliminating the need for 24-hour duty for both USFS/ECC and CVO staff except when eruptions are imminent; entering all predictions and updates into a computer ""news"" system for easy review by those on the call-down list; updating volcanic activity reports when the volcano is quiet; and, most recently, developing a seismic alarm to alert scientists to small events that occur without precursors.          Notification Before And During Events With Precursors    Since May 18, 1980, 21 magmatic eruptions have occurred at Mount St. Helens; 5 were predominantly explosive, and 16 were predominantly non-explosive, dome-building eruptions.  Several eruptions involved both explosive and dome-building activity.  The last magmatic eruption was a dome-building eruption in October 1986.  Scientists at CVO in Vancouver, Washington, and at the University of Washington (UW) Geophysics Program in Seattle were able to predict most of these eruptions based on evaluation and interpretation of data from an extensive monitoring network (Swanson and others, 1985).  Initially, these predictions were issued as verbal statements, but, after December 1980, they were issued as written statements.  Both types of statements were distributed by the USFS through the ECC.    For most eruptions, a series of statements was issued ( table 1 ), usually beginning with an ""extended outlook advisory"" predicting an eruption within several weeks.  As the levels of precursory activity increased, the predicted eruption window was fine-tuned to days or hours, and ""eruption advisories"" and ""eruption alerts"" were issued.  After an eruption began, factual statements were issued regarding the character and effects of the eruption, and, finally, a statement was issued declaring the eruption to be over.  The ""daily updates"" and information tapes for the public and media provided additional information on a daily basis ( table 2 ).              Table 1:    Example of statements by CVO and UW released by ECC during the March-April 1982 eruptive period of Mount St. Helens       Date and Type of Statement   Update         March 5, 1982  - 0900 PST;   EXTENDED OUTLOOK ADVISORY   Seismicity at Mount St. Helens increased around February 21 and has remained at a level somewhat above background since that time.  Approximately 100 earthquakes that occurred during this period have been located.  These earthquakes fall into two groups: (1) a ""deep"" group of very small earthquakes with centers at 6- to 11-kilometer depths, and (2) a shallow group of somewhat larger (magnitude 1 or less) earthquakes located at 3-4 kilometers us to the surface.  There is a pronounced lack of seismicity at a depth of 4-6 kilometers.   Although poor weather during the past week has hampered observations and monitoring on the mountain itself, measurements made last week show only slow ground deformation in the immediate vicinity of the dome and no significant increase in gas emissions.       March 12, 1982  - 0800 PST;   EXTENDED OUTLOOK ADVISORY  Seismicity beneath Mount St. Helens continues at elevated levels, but individual earthquakes are of low magnitude.  Earthquakes have been occurring in 1-2-day-long episodes separated by 1-2-day intervals of decreased activity.  The earthquakes are occurring between the surface and a depth of about 6 miles.  Rates of ground deformation in the crater area have increased during the last two weeks, and they are similar to patterns observed before previous dome-building eruptions.    Based on rates of deformation, an eruption is likely within the next 3 weeks.  Deformation is confined to the crater areas, suggesting that renewed dome growth will occur.  The current seismic patterns differ from any observed before 1980-81 eruptions, however, and raise the possibility of more hazardous variations in eruptive behavior.  If there were to be any pyroclastic flows, from either and explosive eruption or collapse of the steep north face of the dome, the possibility of rapid snowmelt would be a concern.        March 15, 1982  - 1900 PST;   ADVISORY  Accelerating rates of ground deformation in the crater of Mount St. Helens suggest that na eruption, most likely of the dome-building type, will probably begin within 1 to 5 days.  Deep earthquakes have almost ceased, and shallow earthquakes continue at a moderate rate.  A further increase in shallow seismicity is likely before the eruption starts.       March 19, 1982  - 0900 PST;   ERUPTION ALERT  Seismicity at Mount St. Helens has increased significantly during the past day.  This indicates that an eruption will begin soon, probably within the next 24 hours.  The character of both the seismicity and deformation in the crater area indicated the the most likely type of activity is dome growth.       March 19, 1982  - 1933 PST;   ERUPTION ALERT  Verbal statement that eruption had begun at 1927. (Significant increase in seismicity and pilot and radar reports of an ash plume indicated start of eruption.)       March 19, 1982  - 2025 PST;   ERUPTION UPDATE  The eruption has subsided for the time being, and an ash plume is blowing to the SSE. and S. with a lesser amount to the SSW.  The size of the eruption and the amount of the ash appear to be like those of the summer 1980.       March 21, 1982  - 0900 PST;   ERUPTION UPDATE  There is a new lobe being added to the SE. side of the lava dome in the crater of Mount St. Helens.  The new extrusion began during the night.  Seismicity and tilt are now following patterns observed during other recent periods of dome growth.        March 24, 1982  - 1730 PST;   ERUPTION UPDATE  Growth of the new dome lobe has slowed significantly over the past 2 days, but rates of deformation on the north side of the dome have increased over the same period.  Until additional measurements are made, it would be premature to declare this eruption over.  Seismometers are recording decreasing numbers of avalanches as growth of the new lobe slows.       April 5, 1982  - 0100 PST;   ERUPTION UPDATE  Seismicity still continues at moderate to high levels.  Fluctuations in seismicity correspond to pulses of gas and ash, the largest of which began at 1237 a.m. and rose to a maximum of about 32,000 feet.  There does not appear to be much ash in the plume, but minor ashfall was reported earlier tonight at Packwood.  No increases have been reported in river levels.        April 5, 1982  - 1800 PST;   ERUPTION UPDATE  Seismicity is continuing at a moderate to high level.  The status of the volcano remains unchanged since the previous advisory (1 a.m., April 5, 1982).  Some additional dome growth and (or) small-scale explosive activity is likely; larger explosive activity is less likely but cannot be ruled out.        April 6, 1982  - 0915 PST;   ERUPTION UPDATE  Another new lobe is being added to the dome.  This reduced the immediate likelihood of larger explosive activity, but small, intermittent gas and ash pulses may continue to occur.        April 12, 1982  - 1515 PST;   ERUPTION UPDATE  Seismicity, deformation and gas emissions at Mount St. Helens have returned to low levels, indicating that the eruption that began on March 19, 1982 is over.             If the ECC and CVO, in Vancouver, and the UW seismic laboratory, in Seattle, were not already staffed on a 24-hour basis when an ""eruption advisory"" was issued, 24-hour duty was initiated.  USFS, CVO, and UW personnel were ready to respond to rapid changes in the level of volcanic activity and to answer questions and discuss specific concerns.  Because it was not always possible to determine whether there would be explosive activity during and eruption, there were regular discussions among the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), USFS/ECC, and CVO personnel regarding the possibility of ash plumes and their probable trajectories.  CVO and the USFS reported suspected ash-producing events to the FAA as quickly as possible, and the FAA called the ECC or CVO to confirm all pilot reports.  Initially the FAA was contacted at the local Portland, Oregon area office; however, by the mid-1980's most contact with the FAA was made directly with the regional FAA office in Auburn, Washington (Hamley and Parkinson, 1994).                 Table 2:    Examples of ""daily updates"" about Mount St. Helens issued by CVO and UW after the March 15, 1982, advisory and before the March 19, 1982, alert       Date   Update        March 16, 1982  - 0800 PST  Geologists and hydrologists form the Geological Survey performed on-site monitoring in and around Mount St. helens on March 15, 1982.  Measurements showed accelerated rates of ground deformation on thrusts and cracks in the crater.  University of Washington-USGS reports seismicity remains at a slight increase over the weekend's activity.  Shallow earthquakes continue at a moderate rate (see Mount St. Helens Advisory, 7:00 p.m., March 15, 1982).        March 17, 1982  - 0800 PST  Good weather permitted on-site monitoring in and around Mount St. Helens by geologists and hydrologists of the U.S. Geological Survey.  Measurements showed continued acceleration of ground deformation localized around the lava dome.  Overflights of the volcano the last two days have shown an increase in the number of incandescent areas on the dome.  University of Washington-USGS reports seismicity remains at a moderate rate.       March 18, 1982  - 0800 PST  Continued good weather enabled monitoring to be carried out in the crater of Mount St. Helens for the third day in a row.  Measurements performed by geologists from the U.S. Geological Survey continued to document accelerating ground deformation rates.  Airborne gas monitoring around the volcano during the past several days has shown that a moderate increase in the rate of SO2 emissions has occurred.  The University of Washington-USGS seismic lab reports a slight increase in the level of seismicity over that of yesterday, but it still can be described as a moderate level.                  Notification During And After Events Without Precursors     Between 1980 and 1986, hundreds of small ash emissions also occurred.  These small events were known as gas and ash emissions or explosions, and they originated from cracks and small vents on the dome and sent plumes of steam and ash 500 feet (150 meters) to 22,000 feet (6,700 meters) above the volcano.  The more vigorous events also erupted showers of hot rock fragments from the dome, and some events generated small debris flows.    Most of these events took place without recognized precursors, which made advanced warning of these events impossible.  Verbal or written statements were issued to all concerned agencies after the larger or more visible events ( table 3 ).  If an event occurred during normal working hours, the ECC and CVO updated media and public information telephone tapes and contacted the FAA, emergency management officials, and others on the call-down list shortly after the event.  Because the seismic amplitude of these events was too small to trigger alarms on the UW State-wide network, scientists were often unaware (until normal working hours) of events that occurred during non-working hours.  In most cases, this was not a problem because these small events were frequent enough that government officials and the public became familiar with them.  However, the FAA and emergency management personnel occasionally needed to contact CVO for more information after the larger events that may have been visible to pilots or the public.  This contact was made by calling the USFS/ECC telephone beeper number; the USFS, in turn, contacted the CVO duty scientist by telephone or through the beeper, if necessary.             Table 3:    Examples of statements issued by the CVO and UW after eruptive events at Mount St. Helens that occurred without precursors       Type of Notice and When Issued   Statements        June 18, 1982  - 0930 PDT;   DAILY UPDATE  (Distributed by CVO computer ""news"" system)    University of Washington-USGS reports continued low-level seismic activity.  Small gas-emission events continue to occur daily.  The most recent event was at 0621 this morning, June 18.  The plume rose to 12,000 feet.       April 18, 1986  - 1200 PDT;   DAILY UPDATE  (Distributed by CVO computer ""news"" system)    Since yesterday's report at 1300, there have been three more gas and ash emission events.  The first occurred at 1428 on the 17th and produced a plume to 14,000 feet (according to a local pilot).  The second event occurred at about 1 a.m. today.  Minor ashfall from this event was reported SE. of the mountain.  Both of these events appeared to be slightly smaller (seismically) than the 1716 event on the 16th.  The third event occurred at 1116 today and was observed by geologists working in the crater and flying in an airplane around the mountain.  The event appeared to be about the same size (seismically) at Yellow Rock as the 1716 event on the 16th.  Geologists reported that rock fragments were thrown on and around the dome.  The ash plume rose to 14,000 feet and later drifted higher and to the southeast.  The event lasted about 5 minutes seismically, with the vigorous emission lasting just under 2 minutes.    When crew first reached the crater this morning they reported a light dusting of tephra on the east and southeast flanks of the mountain, some tephra on the crater floor, lots of ejected material (rock fragments) on top of the dome, and lots of new snow in the crater.  A pit dug in the snow revealed four, thin (dispersed) ash layers from previous events.    A new update will be issued on Monday unless there is significant activity over the weekend.       May 6, 1986  - 1300 PDT;   INFORMATION STATEMENT  (Distributed by ECC formal call-down and CVO computer ""news"" system)    More than 50 steam and ash explosions have occurred on the dome at Mount St. Helens during the last 3 weeks.  Seismicity has increased from slightly elevated levels at the end of April to moderate level as today.  Most monitoring equipment on the dome has been damaged by the explosions and no longer operates.  One remaining tiltmeter on the dome shows gradually accelerating tilt.  Other deformation measurements have been hampered by inclement weather, inaccessibility of the dome because of the explosions, and loss of many targets.  Hazards from explosions are most likely to be restricted to the crater and flanks of Mount St. Helens.  However, small mudflows caused by explosions in the crater may flow into the North Fork Toutle River, and areas downwind from the volcano may occasionally be dusted by small amounts of ash such as has occurred recently.              During 1989-91, at least six, small, ash-producing explosions occurred at Mount St. Helens, ending a 3-year period during which no eruptive activity took place.  Because none of the 1989-91 explosions had recognizable precursors, they were not predicted, and no advance warnings were issued.  The first of these ash-producing explosions (December 7, 1989) occurred during normal working hours; however, the second explosion (January 6, 1990) occurred on a rainy Saturday morning, and scientists were unaware of the event until several hours later when residents of central Washington began reporting light dustings of ash on their cars.  In fact, CVO was not immediately notified when ash began falling.  Instead, calls from the public prompted the media to contact the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) to see if the ash was from ongoing activity at Redoubt Volcano, near Anchorage.  AVO verified that the ash was not from Redoubt and contacted CVO geologists.            Recent Modifications To Improve CVO's Response Time     The delay in CVO's learning about the January 6, 1990, event, coupled with increased concerns about the hazards of volcanic ash triggered by the Boeing 747 incident in Alaska on December 15, 1989 (Brantley, 1990), prompted CVO to develop a seismic-alarm system that is activated by small, as well as large, volcanic events.  CVO also made a few adjustments in the notification and call-down procedures to improve communication of hazards information during non-working hours.     Seismic Alarm System   Because seismicity is one of the main tools used to monitor volcanoes, CVO and UW maintain a network of 18 seismic stations within 16 kilometers of Mount St. Helens, including three stations in the crater.  These stations provide a detailed record of seismic activity at Mount St. Helens, including earthquakes, tremor, rockfalls, explosions, and mudflows (Jonientz-Trisler and others, 1994).  Most of these seismic events, including many of the small ash-producing explosions, are too small to record on the State-wide network at UW.  However, the events cause significant local ground motions that are detected on the Mount St. Helens network by the CVO real-time seismic-amplitude monitoring system (RSAM) as peaks in the time-averaged seismic amplitude (Endo and Murray, 1991).    An RSAM-based seismic-alarm system was developed and installed for testing 2 days after the January 6, 1990, event and was fully functional by the end of February 1990.  With the RSAM system, a computer program compares the amplitude of a station's average seismic signal during a 1-minute interval with empirically determined threshold values.  If thresholds are exceeded during the same 1-minute interval at several (usually three) of the stations in the crater and on the volcano flanks, an RSAM alert is generated.  The computer is set to automatically dial the duty scientist's 24-hour beeper and transmit a number code indicating an RSAM alert.  The computer redials the beeper every time a new 1-minute RSAM alert is generated.             Table 4:  RSAM alarms that have been triggered at Mount St. Helens between March 1, 1990, and September 20, 1991         Type of event   Number of alarms        Explosion-like seismic events (four of which had confirmed ash plumes)  16       Rockfalls (some with dust plumes)  22       Mount St. Helens earthquakes  1       Regional earthquakes  12        Telemetry problems  6             Many types of events, including explosions, rockfalls, earthquakes, and telemetry problems, can generate alerts ( table 4 ).   Because an alert does not indicate the nature of the event, the duty scientist must examine the seismic signature of the event recorded on the seismographs at CVO to determine the basis for the alert.  Explosion signals can usually be identified by careful evaluation of the signal character (Jonientz-Trisler and others, 1994).  Once an alert is received, the speed with which notification is issued will depend on the time it takes for the duty scientist to reach CVO and the scientist's skill at recognizing explosion signals ( table 5 ).     To date, all known ash-producing explosions since March 1, 1990, have generated alerts.  However, failure of any component (key seismic stations, computer, computer programs, phone system, beeper, or beeper-pager system) would prevent an alert from getting through.  As a precaution, a daily test alert is sent through the system to the beeper.             Table 5: Example of initial CVO response to a seismic event that occurred without precursors during nighttime, November 5, 1990          Time of Event (PST)   Response        0207  Seismic event began.       0208  RSAM alert transmitted to beeper.       0209-0217  Nine more RSAM alerts are transmitted to beeper.   Scientist on duty awake, dressed, and en route to CVO by fourth alert.       0220-0229  Duty scientist arrives at CVO.  Seismic signal evaluated  Scientist-in-charge notified at home -- assistance requested.   UW seismic analyst notified at home.   FAA area manager, Seattle Center, calls with two pilot reports of plume to 30,000 feet.  He gives wind direction and speed at altitude and states that plume will drift SE.  Note: CVO duty scientist was dialing the FAA on one phone line when she received the FAA's call on the second phone line.       0230-0239  Forest Service duty officer notified at home -- assistance requested.  UW updated on situation -- assistance requested.       0240  Continued evaluation and response.            Better Two-Way Communication   When ash-producing explosions occur during non-working hours, the FAA needs a means of quickly contacting CVO without the cumbersome and time-consuming process of first calling the USFS beeper.  Pilots often are the first to observe volcanic plumes; however, sometimes slashburns, storm clouds, or other atmospheric phenomena are mistaken for volcanic plumes.  When a pilot's report of volcanic activity is received (Fox, 1994), the FAA must quickly verify the nature of the event and identify the area affected in order to evaluate the impact on air traffic and to suggest alternate routes if necessary (Hamley and Parkinson, 1994).  By dialing the CVO beeper number, the FAA can now make direct contact, day or night, with the CVO duty scientist.  This change provides rapid verification of pilot reports and backup notification for CVO in case the RSAM alarm system fails.    Dissemination of information through normal USFS channels may also be delayed if CVO should need to contact the USFS by beeper.  To assure that the FAA and NOAA are immediately notified of any ash-producing event, they are contacted directly by CVO as soon as the signal is identified.  If the USFS is delayed in responding to their beeper, CVO will initiate further call-down by notifying the Washington Department of Emergency Management and others as needed.         Conclusions     The development of notification and call-down procedures utilized by CVO and USFS at Mount St. Helens provides a means for rapid response to both predicted and non-predicted events.  Although the procedures have worked in the past, they have been regularly reviewed and updated to meet the changing needs and concerns of emergency-response agencies, businesses, and the public.

GX020-33-8204082	"Scientists' ChaIlenge and Opportunity    The eruptive activity of Mount St. Helens has provided a good test for scientists who faced the challenge of obtaining, relaying, and explaining in easily understandable terms the information needed by the Federal, State, and local officials charged with land management and public safety. It should be reemphasized, however, that a quick response at Mount St. Helens was possible only because decades of systematic research before 1980 had contributed to a good understanding of the volcano's eruptive behavior and potential hazards. Additionally, the Mount St. Helens activity also has provided scientists a unique opportunity to learn much about the dynamics of an active composite volcano. The results of studies completed and in progress have improved the understanding of eruptive mechanisms and should refine a forecasting capability not only for Mount St. Helens but also for similar volcanoes in the United States and elsewhere.           Scientists of the David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory   (CVO) collecting gas samples in Mount St. Helens as part of the geochemical   monitoring program (Photograph by Kathy Cashman).      When the 4.2-magnitude earthquake occurred on March 20, 1980, seismologists of the University of Washington and the USGS began a round-the-clock effort to expand the monitoring and to evaluate the seismic activity. As the number of earthquakes in creased over the next few days, USGS and other scientists discussed with officials of the Gifford Pin chot National Forest the significance of the seismic activity, the safety of USFS facilities near the volcano, and the need to close its upper slopes because of snow avalanche and other hazards. USGS scientist Donal Mullineaux arrived on the scene the evening of March 25, and an emergency coordination center was set up at the USFS headquarters in Vancouver. The next day, Mullineaux-one of the foremost experts on Mount St. Helens-described the possible types of eruptions and associated volcanic hazards at a meeting of representatives from government and industry. Following the meeting, the USFS, State, and county officials decided to extend the area of closure beyond the immediate flanks of the volcano. The same day (March 26), the general nature of potential eruptive activity and volcanic hazards was discussed again at a joint USFS-USGS press conference. An official announcement of a Hazard Watch for Mount St. Helens was issued by the USGS at 8 a.m. PST on March 27. By 12:36 p.m. that day, the first eruption of Mount St. Helens in over a century had begun.    By the time the eruptive activity was into its second week, 25 to 30 scientists were on hand carrying out a wide variety of monitoring and volcanic-hazard-assessment studies. These scientists participated in daily meetings and briefings with USFS and other officials and provided advice on the locations of hazardous zones for use, such as the selection of sites for roadblocks to control access around the volcano. All decisions regarding access and restricted areas, however, were the sole responsibility of the USFS, State of Washington, and other land managers for the Mount St. Helens region. Ironically, in 1980 the section of land containing the summit crater was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad; it has since been acquired by USFS by land exchanges. On March 31, an onsite, comprehensive, volcanic-hazards assessment was presented at another meeting of agencies responsible for public safety. On April 1, a large-scale volcanic-hazards map was prepared for use by these agencies. A news release was issued by the USGS on what might be expected should the activity develop into a ""major eruptive phase."" Scientists contributed geotechnical and volcanichazards information essential for preparing the ""Mount St. Helens Contingency Plan"" issued by the USFS on April 9. Although the possibility that the collapse of the rapidly deforming ""bulge"" on the north flank could trigger a magmatic eruption was considered and discussed with officials at various meetings in late April, scientists could not be sure that such an event would actually occur, let alone estimate its timing or size.    The early recognition of the potential hazards of the bulge on Mount St. Helens' north slope and the systematic measurement of its extremely rapid growth led scientists to advise the USFS that hazards were increasing. Accordingly, the USFS, State, and county officials enforced closure zones. Had these access-control measures not been taken, the catastrophic events of May 18 would have resulted in considerably more human deaths and injury. An element of luck also saved many lives. The catastrophe began hours before the scheduled departure of a caravan of landowners permitted by officials to enter the controlled access area to inspect their properties and cabins. Also, had the eruption occurred on any other day than Sunday, many more people authorized to enter the restricted areas (such as loggers, USFS personnel, and government officials) would have been at work and exposed to the danger.    Legislation passed by Congress in 1974 made the Geoiogical Survey the lead Federal agency responsible for providing reliable and timely warnings of volcanic hazards to State and local authorities. Under this mandate, and recognizing the need to maintain systematic surveillance of Mount St. Helens' continuing activity, the USGS established a permanent regional office at Vancouver, Washington, after the May 18, 1980, eruption. On May 18, 1982, the office at Vancouver was formally designated the David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO), in memory of the Survey volcanologist killed 2 years earlier. Staffed by about 90 permanent and part-time employees-geologists, geophysicists, hydrologists, geochemists, technicians, and supporting personnel-the CVO not only maintains a close watch on Mount St. Helens but also serves as the headquarters for monitoring other volcanoes of the Cascade Range in Washington, Oregon, and northern California. In recent years, the CVO staff has also participated in studies of eruptions or unrest at other volcanoes in the western United States and elsewhere in the world. The Cascades Volcano Observatory is a sister observatory to two other volcano observatories operated by the USGS: the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, founded in 1912, has pioneered or refined most of the modern volcano-monitoring methods used in the world today; and the Alaska Volcano Observatory, established jointly by the USGS and the state of Alaska in 1988, studies the volcanoes of the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Islands.

This photograph shows the laser beam transmitter positioned atop a heavy 12-foot-high steel tower centered over a benchmark used as the mea surement reference point. Such towers allow measure ments to be made at Mount St.Helens during the winter despite deep snow (Photo graph by Lyn Topinka).    Throughout the 1980s, the ability of scientists at CVO and the University of Washington to provide warnings for dome-building eruptive episodes has been exceptional. Indeed, for all episodes (except for one small event) since May 1980, scientistsusing data from seismic, ground deformation, and volcanic gas monitoring-have provided reliable forecasts from several hours to several days, even weeks, in advance of these events. The table (p. 50) gives a typical example of the timely information for one 1982 eruption given to government officials charged with emergency management and to the general public via news releases.

The seismic network, jointly operated by the USGS and   the University of Washington, covers an area much larger than that shown   in the diagram--encompassing the entire State of Washington. EDM stands   for electronic distance-monitoring.      At Mount St. Helens, the track record for predicting eruptions, especially dome-building ones, is better than any previously accomplished for any volcano in the world. Our improving predictive ability, however, has not been tested by any large explosive eruptions.

""             Mount St. Helens has provided, and will continue to provide, an unprecedented opportunity for scientific research on volcanism. Relatively easy accessibility and a dense network of monitoring instruments have made Mount St. Helens a natural laboratory at which scientists can study processes typical of volcanoes elsewhere along the circum-Pacific ""Ring of Fire."" As Mount St. Helens is monitored continuously before, during, and after each eruptive episode, and its eruptive products are regularly sampled for chemical and other laboratory analyses, the information being compiled and interpreted yields a better understanding of Mount St. Helens in particular, and other composite volcanoes in general. Moreover, the monitoring techniques now being used at Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes are the same as, or variations of, those used to monitor the active Hawaiian volcanoes. Thus, in the rather young science of volcanology, there is a rare opportunity to compare the effectiveness of these techniques on two contrasting kinds of volcanoes--the Hawaiian shield volcanoes, which typically erupt nonexplosively, and the Cascade composite volcanoes, which typically erupt explosively. Scientists have learned that data from all types of monitoring are helpful regardless of the type of volcano. From such comparative studies, they will be able to determine which techniques are the most effective and reliable for monitoring each type of volcano. With such tools and broadened knowledge, scientists may be entering a new epoch in volcanology, in which significant advances in understanding volcanic phenomena will be achieved, accompanied by a sharpened ability to forecast and mitigate volcanic hazards.

GX020-29-15565185	"Possible Future Behavior    For a few intensively monitored volcanoes, scientists in recent years have greatly improved their capability to predict when and sometimes even where an eruption might take place, with lead times on the order of several days or less. For example, the current ability to predict eruptive episodes at Mount St. Helens represents a major advance; since 1980, all episodes (except for one very small event in 1984) have been successfully predicted several days to 3 weeks in advance. Even for accurately predicted eruptions, however, there is no way to anticipate their size or duration. Moreover, scientists are not yet able to forecast accurately the long-term future behavior of volcanoes. For example, scientists cannot answer with any certainty the following questions about Mount St. Helens: Is the intermittent activity of the 1980s over? Will another large explosive eruption comparable to that of May 18, 1980, take place within the next decade or even century? Will lava flows accompany future eruptions?    Most earth-science studies are concerned with past events, and the axiom that ""the present is the key to the past"" is fundamental to these studies. In recent years, as earth scientists have been asked repeatedly to look forward in time, the axiom that ""the past and present are keys to the future"" has become increasingly significant. Clues to the possible future behavior of Mount St. Helens are gleaned from its past eruptive history. During the past 50,000 years, Mount St. Helens has experienced nine ""eruptive periods,"" not counting the activity of the 1980s. The term eruptive period is informally used by geoscientists for a segment of a volcano's eruptive history encompassing a series of eruptive episodes closely associated in time and/or type of eruptive processes or products; such periods are separated by dormant intervals, generally of longer duration.    The most recent and best known of the pre-1980 eruptive periods began with a major explosive eruption in 1800 A.D. For the next 57 years, this event was followed by intermittent relatively small explosive eruptions, lava flows, and the extrusion of a lava dome. Assuming that Mount St. Helens behaves as it did in the 19th century, the present activity could continue intermittently for years, possibly decades. Such activity could include the outpouring of lava flows (not observed to date), as well as renewed dome growth and small-to-moderate explosive events. The chance of another catastrophic landslide and blast comparable to that of May 18, 1980, is exceedingly low. The past history of the volcano suggests, however, that one or more explosive eruptions with heavy ash fall comparable to that of the May 18, 1980, eruption might occur before Mount St. Helens returns to a dormant state. This history of intermittent activity is one of the most important reasons why scientists continue to monitor the volcano to detect the intensive, sustained seismic activity and ground deformation that can be expected to accompany any massive infusion of new magma required to break the pattern of dome building in the 1980s and to feed an explosive eruption of major proportions.             View of Mount St. Helens from Johnston Ridge on March   30, 1987 (Photograph by Lyn Topinka); through April 1990, the composite   dome inside the crater has not enlarged since the last eruptive period   in October 1986.         Bezymianny Volcano, Kamchatka, U.S.S.R., erupted violently   in March 1956 and has been intermittently active since then. This photograph,   taken in 1977, shows the growing composite dome of Bezymianny rising above   the crater rim. Mount St. Helens could similarly remain active for several   decades, and continuing dome growth ultimately may fill the crater to form   a new conical summit (Photograph courtesy of the Kamchatka Volcanological   Station).            Subsequent Eruptive Activity    Continuing Volcanic and Hydrologic Hazards       URL: <http://pubs.usgs.gov/publications/msh/possible.html>  Contact:  John Watson   Last updated: 06.25.97"

View is toward      the west.             V olcano      A volcano is a vent at the Earth's surface through which magma (molten      rock) and associated gases erupt, and also the cone built by effusive      and explosive eruptions.               More about volcanoes    When is a volcano considered active?            Surprisingly, there is no consensus among volcanologists on how to      define an active volcano. The lifespan of a volcano can vary from      months to several million years, making such a distinction sometimes      meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even      civilizations. For example, many of Earth's volcanoes have erupted      dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently      showing signs of activity. Given the long lifespan of such volcanoes,      they are very active. By our lifespans, however, they are not.      Complicating the definition are volcanoes that become restless but do      not actually erupt. Are these volcanoes active?        Active volcano      Scientists usually consider a volcano active if it is currently      erupting or showing signs of unrest, such as unusual earthquake      activity or significant new gas emissions. Many scientists also      consider a volcano active if it has erupted in historic time. It's      important to note that the span of recorded history differs from region      to region; in the Mediterranean, recorded history reaches back more      than 3,000 years but in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, it      reaches back less than 300 years, and in Hawai`i, little more than 200     years.        Dormant volcano      Dormant volcanoes are those that are not currently active (as defined      above), but could become restless or erupt again.            Extinct volcano      Extinct volcanoes are those that scientists consider unlikely to erupt      again. Whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to      determine. For example, since calderas have lifespans sometimes      measured in millions of years, a caldera that hasn't produced an      eruption in tens of thousands of years is likely to be considered      dormant instead of extinct. Yellowstone caldera in Yellowstone National      Park is at least 2 million years old and hasn't erupted for 70,000      years, yet scientists do not consider Yellowstone as extinct. In fact,      because the caldera has frequent earthquakes, a very active geothermal      system, and rapid rates of ground uplift, many scientists consider it      to be a very active volcano!

To view or print a document in PDF, download the latest version of the Adobe Acrobat Reader for free from  Adobe's web site.     Volcanoes    Safe air travel is imperiled by the threat of crippling damage to aircraft from volcanic-ash clouds drifting at high altitudes, particularly in the North Pacific where heavily traveled air routes overlie Alaska's 40 active volcanoes.  Long-term operation of real-time volcano monitoring in Alaska is needed to help mitigate volcanic risk to aviation.  From FY 1996 to 2000, with funding from the Federal Aviation Administration of $2 million annually, the USGS has installed, operated, and maintained seismic monitors at 20 active volcanoes in Alaska's distant and relatively inaccessible Aleutian Islands for the purpose of rapidly providing information about impending volcanic activity to the aviation community so that encounters with ash clouds can be averted.  The proposed increase of $500,000 for        FY 2001 would enable the USGS to expand this real-time volcano monitoring capability to an additional high-risk Alaskan volcano.    The USGS monitors selected volcanoes with a combination of instruments and techniques to detect the rise of magma in the Earth's crust so that timely warnings of eruptions can be issued.  Priorities for deciding which areas to monitor and the extent of monitoring needed are based on the likelihood, style, and magnitude of eruptions and on the potential impacts of volcanic activity on people and economic systems.       Can Real-Time Information Help?    Early warning of volcanic eruptions in Alaska played a major role in reducing damage to aircraft from volcanic ash clouds: from $160 million during the eruptions of Mt. Redoubt in 1989-90 to less than $8 million during the eruption of Mt. Spurr in 1992.  The warnings also prevented life-threatening situations for airline passengers and crews in 1996 during the eruption of Pavlof Volcano on the Alaska Peninsula.      Volcanoes pose a direct threat to many communities in the western United States, Hawaii, and Alaska.  In addition, volcanic ash clouds drifting at high altitudes are a hazard to aircraft.  They are carried by jet stream winds over the United States, Canada, and the Pacific Ocean. The USGS helps reduce the human and economic losses and disruptions associated with volcanic activity by (1) assessing and monitoring potential volcanic hazards, (2) providing warning information on volcanic activity and rapid monitoring response to volcanic crises, and (3) improving the scientific understanding of volcanic processes.  With approximately 70 active and potentially active volcanoes, the United States is among the most volcanically vigorous countries in the world.  During the twentieth century, volcanic eruptions in Washington, California, Alaska, and Hawaii devastated thousands of square miles and caused substantial economic and societal disruption and, in the worst instances, loss of life.      USGS monitoring is conducted at its four volcano observatories in Alaska, the Cascades, Hawaii, and Long Valley, California; the observatories collaborate with universities or State and Federal agencies. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) is a cooperative effort of the USGS, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the State of Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys.  AVO monitors the volcanoes of Alaska, which threaten not only local populations but also aircraft and travelers using the major air routes across the North Pacific.  AVO also is responsible for disseminating warnings about dangerous eruptions and ash clouds from Kamchatkan volcanoes that may affect planes flying in U.S.-controlled airspace. The Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in Vancouver, Washington, monitors the volcanoes of the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon (in partnership with the University of Washington) and northern California. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) monitors volcanoes on the Island of Hawaii; the eruption of Kilauea Volcano, which began in 1983, still continues. The Long Valley Volcano Observatory in California focuses on the large Long Valley volcanic center near Mammoth Lakes, where complex signs of volcanic unrest have recurred episodically since 1980.  The USGS also supports seismic monitoring of the Yellowstone volcanic region in partnership with the University of Utah.       The USGS works closely with scientists in other agencies; public-safety officials at the Federal, State, and local levels; government land managers; business leaders; the media; land developers and planners; educational institutions; and citizens' groups.  Information is disseminated through briefings, workshops, maps, scientific publications, videos, digital databases, web sites, newspaper articles, and interviews with news and education media.  During volcanic crises, USGS personnel work directly with authorities responsible for public safety.

Volcano Hazards    Current Program Highlights      The USGS Volcano Hazards Program helps reduce the human and economic losses and disruptions associated with volcanic activity by (1) assessing and monitoring potential volcanic hazards, (2) providing warning information on volcanic activity and rapid monitoring response to volcanic crises, and (3) improving the scientific understanding of volcanic processes.  With approximately 70 active and potentially active volcanoes, the United States is among the most volcanically vigorous countries in the world.  During the twentieth century, volcanic eruptions in Washington, California, Alaska, and Hawaii devastated thousands of square miles and caused substantial economic and societal disruption and, in the worst instances, loss of life.  With rising populations, development pressures, and expanding national and international air traffic over volcanic regions, the exposure of human life and enterprise to volcanic hazards is increasing.  Under the Stafford Act (Public Law 93-288), the USGS has the responsibility to issue timely warnings of potential volcanic disasters to civil authorities and affected communities.  The Volcano Hazards Program exists to lessen the harmful impacts of volcanic activity by monitoring potentially active volcanoes, forecasting eruptions, delineating the effects that may result, and helping determine appropriate mitigation actions.    Monitoring Potentially Active Volcanoes --  The USGS monitors volcanoes with a combination of instruments and techniques to detect the rise of magma in the Earth's crust so that forecasts and timely warnings of eruptions can be issued.  By the end of FY 1999 the program was monitoring 42 U.S. volcanoes at its four volcano observatories which collaborate as appropriate with universities and State and Federal agencies:     1) The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the Island of Hawaii, where the most recent eruption of Kilauea Volcano, which    began in 1983, still continues unabated.    2) The Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington, near Mt. St. Helens.    3) The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), a cooperative effort of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program, the University    of Alaska Fairbanks, and the State of Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys.  AVO monitors the    volcanoes of Alaska, which threaten not only local populations but also aircraft and travelers using the major air    routes across the North Pacific.  AVO also is responsible for disseminating warnings about dangerous eruptions and    ash clouds from Kamchatkan volcanoes that may affect U.S.-controlled airspace.    4) (4) The Long Valley Volcano Observatory in California, which focuses on the large Long Valley volcanic center where    volcanic unrest has recurred episodically since 1980.  Current program emphasis is on enhancing monitoring    capabilities with improvements to equipment, software, and telemetry so that data from all restless, active, or    potentially hazardous U.S. volcanoes can be acquired, processed, analyzed, and disseminated very rapidly.    Through a joint effort with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the USGS operates a mobile volcano-monitoring observatory to respond to selected volcanic crises around the world.  At the request of other countries and working through USAID and the State Department, USGS scientists provide rapid-response volcano monitoring to determine nature of volcanic unrest and assess possible consequences of eruptive activity.  The USGS benefits from this activity abroad by refining monitoring methods for use in domestic volcanic crises (such as at Redoubt Volcano and Mt. Spurr in Alaska in 1989 and 1992).  A stunningly successful emergency response occurred in 1991 at Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines where USGS and Philippine scientists predicted the volcano's explosive eruption, saving tens of thousands of lives of the people living around the volcano and providing critical advice to the U.S. Air Force at Clark Air Base and the U.S. Navy at Subic Bay Naval Station.     Assessing Volcanic Hazards --  USGS assessments of volcanic hazards are used to anticipate the effects of future eruptions and to identify the appropriate level of monitoring at specific volcanoes.  Information obtained through geologic mapping, dating and analysis of eruptive deposits, hydrologic investigations, and geopyhsical analysis is combined in hazard-zonation maps, digital databases, and probabilistic recurrence and inundation models.  Assessments are updated by the Volcano Hazards Program as new data become available and are critical input to emergency preparedness and land-use planning.  Current program emphasis is on preparing new hazards assessments for volcanic centers in Hawaii (Hawaii Island, East Maui), California (Lassen Volcanic National Park), and Alaska (Aleutian Islands, Cook Inlet) and revised assessments for volcanoes in Washington (Mount Rainier, Mount Baker).  New methods for probabilistic assessment are being developed for application along with more traditional means of describing hazard potential.    Studying Volcanic Processes --  USGS volcano-monitoring strategy and analysis of precursory unrest are founded on an understanding of magmatic processes and eruption dynamics.  The Volcano Hazards Program uses many tools from seismology, geophysics, geochemistry, field geology, and hydrology to acquire that fundamental understanding.  Topics of interest include the process of magma movement in relation to seismicity and ground deformation, mechanisms by which volcanic systems originate and change over time, the role of magmatic gases in eruption dynamics, interaction of magma and eruptive products with ground or surface water, and the dynamics of mudflows and debris avalanches at volcanoes.    Disseminating Information About Volcanoes --  The results of volcano-hazard studies must be effectively conveyed to the community they are intended to serve.  Accordingly, the Volcano Hazard Program works closely with scientists in other institutions, public-safety officials at the Federal, State, and local levels, government-land managers, business leaders, the media, land developers and planners, educational institutions, and citizens groups.  Information is disseminated through briefings, workshops, maps, scientific publications, videos, digital databases, web sites, newspaper articles and interviews with media.  During volcanic crises, USGS personnel work directly with authorities responsible for public safety, and current program emphasis is on preparation of interagency operational response plans.  Information concerning volcano hazards can be obtained at the Volcano Hazards Program's (VHP) website at  http://volcanoes.usgs.gov.       Recent Accomplishments     Eruption Response in Alaska --  On April 17, 1999, following more than three months of precursory seismic and thermal activity, Shishaldin volcano in the eastern Aleutian Islands began a brief but vigorous episode of explosive eruptions that sent volcanic-ash plumes to over 50,000 feet above sea level intermittently for about one month.  This explosive activity from one of Alaska's most active volcanoes (28 eruptions since 1774) was successfully monitored by the Alaska Volcano Observatory using a newly installed real-time seismic network and improved techniques for rapidly examining meteorological satellite imagery.  Volcanic ash from Shishaldin posed a threat to jet aircraft in the heavily traveled North Pacific air routes, but because of information provided by the USGS to the National Weather Service and the Federal Aviation Administration, aircraft were diverted and rerouted around potentially hazardous ash clouds.  Volcanic ash erupted into the high atmosphere is highly hazardous to modern high-performance jet aircraft because it erodes compressor blades, melts onto critical engine parts, and causes loss of engine power.  Hazardous concentrations of volcanic ash can drift at air-traffic altitudes for hundreds to thousands of miles downwind following a volcanic eruption.  Worldwide, approximately 100 jet aircraft in the last 18 years have accidentally entered volcanic-ash clouds, putting many thousands of passengers at risk.    Sustained Vigilance in the Face of Long-lived Eruptions and Unrest --  The USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory continued to monitor the ongoing (since 1983) eruption of Kilauea volcano on Hawaii Island, helping the National Park Service and County Civil Defense to keep people out of harm's way while still allowing them to enjoy the island's natural beauty.  In addition to scorching lava flows, Kilauea's hazards include sulfurous vog (volcanic smog) that has debilitating respiratory effects on people, explosive eruptions caused by mixing of magma and groundwater, sudden collapses into the ocean of oversteepened new lava benches, damaging earthquakes, and local tsunamis, all of which HVO helps to assess.  At Long Valley caldera, adjacent to a popular recreational area in California and in the path of heavily traveled West Coast air-traffic routes, USGS scientists continued to monitor the latest signs of the area's two decades of recurring volcanic unrest.  By providing objective interpretation of the significance of the unrest and by openly communicating with affected communities and agencies, the USGS is reducing uncertainties about potential volcanic activity there and contributing to informed decision-making by private individuals, businesses, and public officials.  At Mount St. Helens in Washington, the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory and its partner the University of Washington kept a vigilant eye on the volcano, monitoring the intermittent seismic swarms and small mudflows that still persist there long after the catastrophic eruption of 1980.  With a heavily visited U.S. Forest Service visitor center now situated a few miles north of the summit crater excavated in the explosive 1980 eruption, continuing watchfulness is well warranted.    Volcano Monitoring Improvements --  In Hawaii, seismic monitoring was initiated for the Island of Maui, in response to recent geologic studies that identified Haleakala volcano as having had more frequent eruptions than previously recognized.  On the Island of Hawaii, a network of borehole tiltmeters was established on Mauna Loa and Kilauea, providing the first reliable real-time deformation monitoring of the two volcanoes.  In Alaska, the Alaska Volcano Observatory established a real-time seismic monitoring node on Adak Island, proving that it is possible to work in the remote western Aleutians and paving the way for eventual monitoring of all of Alaska's potentially active volcanoes.  Concurrent geologic field studies established that volcanoes on Adak have produced larger, more explosive eruptions that previously realized.  At Long Valley, enhancements of the network to monitor ground deformation continued, and improvements in on-site computer processing and telemetry were initiated to improve availability to scientists of data from different types of sensors.  In Yellowstone National Park, monitoring of the very large Yellowstone caldera was improved with additional continuously recording ground-deformation sensors used in combination with an innovative satellite radar technique.     International Volcanic Hazard Mitigation --  Through the joint USGS/USAID Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, during the past year USGS scientists responded to official requests to help interpret precursory unrest and eruptions at two volcanoes in Ecuador:  Guagua Pichincha, adjacent to the capital city of Quito, and Tungurahua, near the popular tourist destination of Banos.  Over a period of several months and working with host-country scientists, USGS volcanologists aided with monitoring-network upgrades, data interpretation, assessment of potential hazards, and development of a public-notification scheme.  To minimize disruption of operations at Quito International Airport, USGS personnel provided information about the effects of ash falls to airport officials and American air carriers, and arranged for staff of Anchorage International Airport experienced with ash impacts to visit and advise Quito's airport managers.  At the time of this writing, both Pinchincha and Tungurahua simultaneously were in eruptive phases, with ~25,000 people displaced from areas at greatest risk.    Emergency Preparedness --  Progress was made on interagency efforts to lay groundwork in advance of emergency operations during potential volcanic activity:  An interagency plan to respond to volcanic hazards at Mount Rainier, Washington, was finalized among USGS, municipal, county, state, and other Federal agencies.  The plan lays out responsibilities of the various entities during a volcanic crisis, including aspects of public education and information dissemination.  For the Long Valley area in California, the USGS participated in an exercise that used a hypothetical eruption to test the emergency communication systems between about two dozen government agencies and private industry.  Results from the communication exercise are being used by other agencies to improve the delivery of information during diverse future emergencies, not just volcanic ones. The Interagency Volcanic Ash Warning Plan for Alaska was updated and signed by the USGS, Federal Aviation Administration, National Weather Service, U.S. Air Force, and Alaska Department of Emergency Services.  The plan establishes integrated and timely communications for air-traffic safety during volcanic eruptions in the North Pacific region.

From: Simkin and Siebert, 1994, Volcanoes of the World: Smithsonian Institution and Geoscience Press, Inc., Tucson, Arizona, 349p.         Indonesia  consists of more than 13,000 islands, spread over an area approximating that of the conterminous United States.  ...   Although Chinese records show a  Krakatau  eruption in the 3rd century AD, and some 17 additional historical eruptions are reported from  Kelut  as well as  Krakatau  through the 15th century, uncertainty surrounds many of them.  Europeans first began to document eruptions in 1512 ( Sangeang Api  and  Gunungapi Wetar ), about the time Portugal gained control of the Mollucan clove trade.  ... The    disastrous Krakatau eruption of 1883   was followed by several devastating eruptions on other islands and in 1920 a Volcano Survey was established by the government, leading to much improved volcano monitoring and reporting.  ... The  Volcanological Survey of Indonesia (VSI)  now operates a network of 64 volcano observatories continuously monitoring 59 volcanoes.      The great sweep of the  Sunda Arc , over 3,000 kilometers from NW Sumatra to the Banda Sea, results from the     subduction of Indian Ocean crust beneath the Asian Plate.     This arc includes 76% of the region's volcanoes, but those on either end are tectonically more complex. To the NNW, the basaltic volcanism of the Andaman Islands results from short spreading centers, and to the east the  Banda Arc  reflects Pacific Ocean crust subducted westward.  North of this arc, tectonic complexity increases, with converging plate fragments forming multiple subduction zones, mainly oriented N-S, that in turn produce the  Sulawesi-Sangihe volcanoes  on the west and  Haimahera  on the east of the collision zone.      Indonesia leads the world in many volcano statistics.  It has the largest number of historically active volcanoes (76), its total of 1,171 dated eruptions is only narrowly exceeded by Japan's 1,274, and these two regions have combined to produce 1/3 of the known explosive eruptions.  Indonesia has suffered the highest numbers of eruptions producing fatalities, damage to arable land, mudflows, tsunamis, domes, and pyroclastic flows. ...   Four-fifths of Indonesian volcanoes with dated eruptions have erupted in this century ...                Agung            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000         The symmetrical  Agung stratovolcano , Bali's highest and most sacred mountain, towers over the   eastern end of the island. The NE and SW flanks of Agung extend to the coast, and the volcano rises   above the caldera rim of Batur volcano on the NW. The summit of Agung contains a steep-walled,   500-meter-wide, 200-meter-deep crater. The flank cone Pawon is located low on the SE side of Gunung   Agung. Only a few eruptions have been recorded in historical time.           From: NASA's Earth Observing Project Science Webpage: Volcanoes and Global Climate Change, May 2000        Volcanic eruptions are thought to be responsible for the global cooling that has been observed for a few years after a major eruption.  The amount and global extent of the cooling depend on the force of the eruption and, possibly, its latitude.  When large masses of gases from the eruption reach the stratosphere, they can produce a large, widespread cooling effect.  As a prime example, the effects of     Mount Pinatubo ,  which erupted in June 1991, may have lasted a few years, serving to offset temporarily the predicted greenhouse effect.      Global cooling often has been linked with major volcanic eruptions.   The year 1816 often has been referred to as ""the year without a summer"".  It was a time of significant weather-related disruptions in New England and in Western Europe with killing summer frosts in the United States and Canada.  These strange phenomena were attributed to a major eruption of the     Tambora volcano in 1815 in Indonesia .    The volcano threw sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, and the aerosol layer that formed led to brilliant sunsets seen around the world for several years.      However, there is some confusion about the historical evidence that  global cooling may be caused by volcanic emissions.   Two recent volcanic eruptions have provided contradictory evidence on this point.      Mount Agung in 1963  (Indonesia)    apparently caused a considerable decrease in temperatures around much of the world, whereas    El Chichon in 1982  (Mexico) ,   seemed to have little effect, perhaps because of its different location or because of the  El Nino that occurred the same year.  El Nino is a Pacific Ocean phenomenon,  but it causes worldwide weather variations that may have acted to cancel out the effect of the El Chichon eruption.         From: Self, et.al., 1996, The Atmospheric Impact of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo Eruption: IN: Newhall and Punongbayan, (eds.), 1996, Fire and Mud: Eruptions and Lahars of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines: University of Washington Press        As observed after several eruptions, including    Agung in 1963  (Indonesia)  and     El Chichon in 1982  (Mexico) ,   stratospheric warming and lower tropospheric and surface cooling have been documented after the    Pinatubo eruption .    Labitzke and McCormick (1992) show that warming in the lower stratosphere (16 to 24 kilometers or 30 to 100 mbar) of up to 2 to 3 degrees C occurred within 4 to 5 months of the eruption between the equator and 20degreesNorth latitude, and it was also later noticed in middle northern latitudes (Angell, 1993).  The warming distribution closely mirrored the dispersal pattern of the aerosol cloud; this mirroring strongly suggests that the warming was due to absorption of radiation by the aerosols.  The warming was more intense in southern temperate-polar latitudes, perhaps due to the presence of aerosols from the      Mount Hudson  (Chile)    eruption.  Such temperature changes can influence stratospheric dynamics (Pitari, 1992).  Since the peak of stratospheric warming in late 1991, temperatures in the 18- to 24-kilometer region have cooled considerably, passing the average in early 1993; temperatures in 1993 were the coldest ever recorded (Christy and Drouilhet, 1994; Monastersky, 1994) and may be related to ozone destruction in the lower stratosphere.  Stratospheric temperatures also plummeted and stayed cooler than average for 7 years after the   El Chichon  eruption.                Batur            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000        The historically active Batur volcano is located at the center of two concentric calderas NW of   Agung volcano. The SE side of the larger 10 x 13 km caldera contains a caldera lake. The inner   7.5-kilometer-wide caldera, which was formed during emplacement of the Bali (or Ubud) ignimbrite, has   been dated at about 23,670 and 28,500 years ago (Wheller 1986, Sutawidjaja et al. 1992). The SE   wall of the inner caldera lies beneath Lake Batur; Batur cone has been constructed within the inner   caldera to a height above the outer caldera rim. The Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over   much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along   the summit ridge. Historical eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity   sometimes accompanied by lava emission. Basaltic lava flows from both summit and flank vents have   reached the caldera floor and the shores of Lake Batur in historical time.         The caldera contains an active, 700-meter-tall stratovolcano rising above the  surface of Lake Batur.   The first historically documented eruption of Batur was in 1804, and it has been frequently active since   then.                 Galunggung            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000          The forested slopes of Galunggung volcano in western Java are cut by a horseshoe-shaped   caldera breached to the ESE that has served to channel the products of recent eruptions to the SE.   The ""Ten Thousand Hills of Tasikmalaya"" dotting the plain below the volcano are debris-avalanche   hummocks from the collapse that formed the breached caldera about 4,200 years ago. Although   historical eruptions, restricted to the central vent near the caldera headwall, have been infrequent, they   have caused much devastation.         From: Brantley and Glicken, 1986,  Volcanic Debris Avalanches: Earthquakes & Volcanoes, v.18, n.6, p.195-206.      On the southeast slope of  Galunggung Volcano   on the densely populated island of Java, a hummocky deposit called the   ""Ten Thousand Hills of Tasik Malaja""  drew the attention of European geologists in the early  part of the 20th century.  Dutch geologist B.G. Escher hypothesized that a breakout of a crater lake resulted in a watery landslide that formed the deposit.  The hummocks were likely material left behind as the more watery parts of the slide flowed away.  Austrian geologist F.X. Schaffer suggested that the hummocks might be manmade; as the local people cleared the land to make ricefields, they made dumps of the boulders and cobbles that they found.  The dumps became hummocks, and were used as sites for homes and fruit trees, as they offered protections from hostile people as well as from the mosquitoes and rats of the rice fields.  Schaffer noted that the volume of material might seem large for ""occidentals but it is not beyond the powers of the numerous and industrious Malays.""      The horseshoe shape of Galunggung's crater and the nature of the hummocks, however, suggest a different cause for the formation of the Ten Thousand Hills.  Since 1980, geologists from the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia and the U.S. Geological Survey have reinterpreted the deposit as a debris-avalanche deposit.  Quarry exposures show pieces of the old volcano -- the block facies -- shattered but intact, that are similar to the deposits at Mount St. Helens and Mount Shasta.  Radiocarbon dates of a lava flow within the deposit show that the debris avalanche is less than 23,000 years old.               Ijen            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2001          The Ijen volcano complex consists of a group of small  stratovolcanoes constructed within the large 20-kilometer-wide Ijen (Kendeng) caldera. The north caldera wall  forms a prominent arcuate ridge, but elsewhere the caldera rim is buried by post-caldera volcanoes, including  Gunung Merapi stratovolcano, which forms the 2799 meter high point of the Ijen complex. Immediately west of Gunung Merapi is the renowned  historically active Kawah Ijen volcano, which contains a nearly one-kilometer-wide, turquoise-colored, acid crater lake.  The picturesque lake is the site of a labor-intensive sulfur mining operation, in which sulfur-laden baskets are  hand-carried from the crater floor. Many other post-caldera cones and craters are located within the caldera or along its rim.  The largest concentration of post-caldera cones forms an E-W-trending zone across the southern side of the caldera.   The active crater at Kawah Ijen has an equivalent radius of 361 meters,  a surface of 41 x 106 square meters, it is 200 meters deep and has a volume of 36 x 106 cubic meters (Pasternack and Varekamp, 1997).                Kaba            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000         Kaba, a twin volcano with Mount Hitam, has an elongated summit crater complex dominated by   three large historically active craters trending ENE from the summit to the upper NE flank. The   SW-most crater of Gunung Kaba, Kawah Lama, is the largest. Most historical eruptions have affected   only the summit region of the volcano. They mostly originated from the central summit craters, although   the upper-NE flank crater Kawah Vogelsang also produced explosions during the 19th and 20th   centuries. In 1833 an eruption ejected water from the crater lake, forming lahars that produced   damage and fatalities at Talang, Klingi, and Bliti villages.               Karangetang (Api Siau)            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000         Karangetang (Api Siau) volcano at the northern end of the island of Siau, north of Sulawesi, contains five summit craters along a N-S line. Karangetang is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, with more than 40 eruptions recorded since 1675 and many additional small  eruptions that were not documented in the historical record (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World). Twentieth-century eruptions have included frequent explosive activity sometimes accompanied by pyroclastic flows and lahars. Lava dome growth has occurred in the summit craters; collapse  of lava flow fronts has also produced pyroclastic flows.               Kelut            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000         The relatively small Kelut stratovolcano contains a summit crater lake that has been the source of   some of Indonesia's most deadly eruptions. A cluster of summit lava domes cut by numerous craters   has given the summit a very irregular profile. Satellitic cones and lava domes are also located low on   the eastern, western, and SSW flanks. Eruptive activity has in general migrated in a clockwise   direction around the summit vent complex. More than 30 eruptions have been recorded from Gunung   Kelut since 1000 AD. The ejection of water from the crater lake during Kelut's typically short, but violent   eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and   destruction. The construction of drainage tunnels beginning in 1926 to lower the lake level has greatly   reduced the human impact of recent eruptions.                Krakatau            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000        The renowned Krakatau volcano lies in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra. Caldera   collapse, perhaps in 416 AD, destroyed the ancestral Krakatau edifice, forming a 7-km-wide caldera.   Remnants of this volcano formed Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and   Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera   collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left   only a remnant of Rakata volcano. The post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau),   constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan,   has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.                       Krakatau 1883 Eruption                  Lokon-Empung            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2001        The twin volcanoes Lokon and Empung, rising about 800 meters above the plain of Tondano, are among   the most active volcanoes of Sulawesi. Lokon, the higher of the two peaks, whose summits are only 2.2   kilometers apart, has a flat, craterless top. The morphologically younger Empung volcano has a 400-meter-wide,   150-meter-deep crater that erupted last in the 18th century, but all subsequent eruptions have originated from   Tompaluan, a 150 x 250 meter-wide double crater situated in the saddle between the two peaks.                 Merapi            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000         Merapi, one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, dominates the landscape immediately north of   the city of Yogyakarta in one of the world's most densely populated areas. Merapi is the youngest and   southernmost of a volcanic chain extending NNW to Ungaran volcano. The steep-sided modern   Merapi edifice, its upper part unvegetated due to frequent eruptive activity, was constructed to the SW   of an arcuate scarp cutting the eroded older Batulawang volcano. Pyroclastic flows and lahars   accompanying growth and collapse of the steep-sided active summit lava dome have devastated   cultivated lands on the volcano's western-to-southern flanks and caused many fatalities during   historical time.    Since 1953, activity has been characterized by extrusion of lava into the summit crater, with   periodic lava dome collapse and nuée ardente formation. Summit lava dome growth has continued   since the 1969 gas explosion. It is monitored from the Merapi Volcano Observatory (MVO) in   Yogyakarta.                      Merapi Volcano Menu                  Peuet Sague            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2001         The name Peuet Sague (summit elevation - 2,780 meters), which has numerous spelling variants  (e.g. Peut Sagoe, Peuet Sagu, Puet Sagu, Peuet Sagoee), means ""square."" Accordingly,  Peuet Sague, a stratovolcano, contains four summit peaks. It is located in Sigli Regency, Aceh Province near Seulawah Agam and  Burni Telong volcanoes.   The crater believed to be active resides SE of one of the peaks of the lava dome  (Mount Tutung). This   narrow crater has a diameter of about 70 meters and a depth of 80 meters.                   Semeru            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000         Semeru, the highest volcano on Java, and one of its most active, lies at the southern end of a   volcanic massif extending north to the Tengger caldera. The steep-sided volcano, also referred to as   Mahameru (Great Mountain), rises abruptly to 3,676 m above coastal plains to the south. Gunung   Semeru was constructed south of the overlapping Ajek-ajek and Jambangan calderas. A line of   lake-filled maars was constructed along a N-S line cutting through the summit, and cinder cones and   lava domes occupy the eastern and NE flanks. Summit topography is complicated by the shifting of   craters from NW to SE.                   Soputan            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000         The small conical volcano of Soputan on the southern rim of the Quaternary Tondano caldera is   one of Sulawesi's most active volcanoes. The youthful, largely unvegetated Soputan volcano is located   SW of Sempu volcano and was constructed at the southern end of a SSW-NNE trending line of vents.   During historical time the locus of eruptions has included both the summit crater and Aeseput, a   prominent NE flank vent that formed in 1906 and was the source of intermittent major lava flows until   1924.                 Tambora            From: NASA's Earth Observing Project Science Webpage: Volcanoes and Global Climate Change, May 2000           Global cooling  often has been linked with major volcanic eruptions.   The year 1816 often has been referred to as ""the year without a summer"" .  It was a time of significant weather-related disruptions in New England and in Western Europe with killing summer frosts in the United States and Canada.  These strange phenomena were attributed to a major eruption of the    Tambora volcano in 1815 in Indonesia .    The volcano threw sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, and the aerosol layer that formed led to brilliant sunsets seen around the world for several years.        From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Website, 2002        The massive  Tambora      stratovolcano    forms the entire 60-kilometer-wide  Sanggar Peninsula on northern Sumbawa Island.   Tambora  grew to about 4000 meters elevation before forming a     caldera    more than 43,000 years ago.  Late-Pleistocene lava flows largely filled the early caldera, after which activity changed to dominantly explosive eruptions  during the early Holocene.  Tambora  was the source of   history's largest explosive eruption, in April 1815 .      Pyroclastic flows    reached the  sea on all sides of the peninsula and heavy     tephra fall    devastated croplands, causing an estimated 60,000 fatalities. The eruption of more  than 150 cubic kilometers of tephra formed a 6-kilometer-wide, 1250-meter-deep caldera and produced global climatic effects. Minor     lava domes    and flows  have been extruded on the caldera floor during the 19th and 20th centuries.                   Tambora 1815 Eruption                Tengger Caldera, Sandsea Caldera, Bromo Cone            From: Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program Website, 2000         The 16-kilometer-wide Tengger caldera is located at the northern end of a volcanic massif extending from Semeru Volcano.  The massive Tengger volcanic complex dates back to the early Pleistocene and consists of five overlapping stratovolcanoes, each truncated by a caldera. Lava domes, pyroclastic cones, and a maar occupy the flanks of the massif.  The most recent of the Tengger calderas is the 9 x 10 kilometer-wide Sandsea caldera, which formed incrementally during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene.  An overlapping cluster of post-caldera cones was constructed on the floor of the Sandsea caldera within the past several thousand years.  The youngest of these is Bromo, on of Java's most active and most frequently visited volcanoes.  Bromo is a centrally located cone, with a 700-meter-diameter crater.

GX037-05-13723567	[ TEXT & GRAPHICS ]    U.S. Geological Survey  -  Hawaiian Volcano Observatory    Other Volcanoes  -  Haleakala  -  Lo`ihi           Hualalai   Hualalai is the third youngest and third-most historically active volcano on the Island of Hawai`i. Six different vents erupted lava between the late 1700s and 1801, two of which generated lava flows that poured into the sea on the west coast of the island. The Keahole Airport, located only 11 km north of Kailua-Kona, is built atop the larger flow.   Though Hualalai is not nearly as active as Mauna Loa or Kilauea, our recent geologic mapping of the volcano shows that 80 percent of Hualalai's surface has been covered by lava flows in the past 5,000 years. In the past few decades, when most of the resorts, homes, and commercial buildings were built on the flanks of Hualalai, earthquake activity beneath the volcano has been low. In 1929, however, an intense swarm of earthquakes lasting more than a month was most likely caused by magma rising to near the surface. For these reasons, Hualalai is considered a potentially dangerous volcano that is likely to erupt again in the next 100 years.    Hualalai Facts    Location  19.69 N 155.87 W    Elev.

Well-documented examples of recent volcanic activity are extremely  helpful in interpreting current volcano unrest and in improving our  understanding of pre-historic eruptions. Since 1971, scientists of the  Smithsonian Institution have aggressively sought descriptions of  ongoing volcanism around the world. Such descriptions of volcanic  activity have become part of an enormous volcano data base maintained  by the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Project. This book presents the  world's most complete volcano data base in a single condensed volume  and includes descriptions of the data elements included in the data  tables, guidelines followed in building the data base, interesting  examples of volcanism from the historic record, and a brief explanation  of age-dating techniques that were used to estimate when eruptions have  occurred.

Alaska hosts within its borders over 80 major volcanic centers that  have erupted during the past 10,000 years. At least 29 of these volcanic centers  had historical eruptions and 12 additional volcanic centers may have had  historical eruptions. Historical in Alaska generally means the period  since 1760 when explorers, travelers, and inhabitants kept written records.  These 41 volcanic centers have been the source for more than 256 eruptions  reported from Alaska volcanoes. For each of these 41 volcano centers, the  report provides a wealth of summary information, including location and  elevation, volcano type, descriptions of volcanic structures and historical  activity, and compostion of erupted products. Also included are small  maps of each volcano center, a reference to the USGS 1:250,000 scale  quadrangle map on which a center can be found, and the  volcano number listed in the Catalogue of Active Volcanoes of the World.

Online version of Fire and Mud    Fire and Mud is a comprehensive document of the awakening of Mount  Pinatubo after a 500-year period of quiet. Its 62 technical reports  tell of the scientific and human story of the 1991 eruption of Mount  Pinatubo and the events surrounding it. In this volume, volcanologists  from 10 countries explore the precursors, processes, and products of  the eruption, as well as record- setting erosion and lahars that  followed. Nearly half of what the eruption deposited on the slopes of  Pinatubo's slopes has now been eroded and dumped, in repeated rounds of  terror, on villages at the foot of the volcano. In the twentieth  century, this eruption was second in size only to a eruption at  Novarupta, Alaska, in 1912. Ten times larger than the eruption of Mount  St. Helens in 1980, Pinatubo's eruption threatened the lives of  millions of people Volcanologists and civil defense officials will  consult this book for years to come as they seek to understand large  eruptions and to protect communities at risk from long-dormant  volcanoes. Scholars and students will find here an interdisciplinary  view of a fascinating, incredibly dynamic geologic system.

This collection of 62 technical reports summarizes the early results of  the wide-ranging studies of the volcanic activity and the eruptive  products at Mount St. Helens in 1980 and describes the response of the  USGS to monitor and assess hazards at the volcano. The reawakening of  Mount St. Helens in March 1980 and its catastrophic eruption will  surely rank among the most significant geologic events in the United  States in the 20th century. The enormous landslide, explosive eruption,  pyroclastic flows, ashfall, and lahars that occurred on May 18 were a  vivid reminder of the hazardous eruptive activity that can occur from  volcanoes in the US. The reports collected here were mostly written in  late 1980, with some revisions and updating as late as January 1981.  They accordingly constitute initial, in part preliminary, reports and  interpretations of the 1980 activity.

GX019-94-6310715	"1992 Eruption of Mount Spurr, Alaska  June 27 Episode Preceded by Heightened Earthquake Activity                      This graph shows the number of earthquakes that occurred beneath Mount  Spurr every day between February 1 and June 30, 1992. The red line  indicates the time of the June 27 eruption. Though the earthquake  activity showed the volcano was indeed restless, there was no  significant change in the activity in the days before the eruption.  Scientists issued general warnings about the potential for an eruption  at the volcano in the Alaska Volcano Updates on June 8 and 26 (see  below), but on the basis of the earthquake activity, they were not able  to issue a specific short- term warning that an eruption was likely in  a few days.     Alaskan Volcano Updates Issued by the Alaska Volcano Observatory     The Alaska Volcano Observatory provides information about Alaskan  volcanoes through written updates (weekly and as needed), a level of  concern color code, emergency notification by telephone, and direct  personal communication with the public and individuals working in  private industry, Federal, State, and local government agencies, and  the news media. The written updates that provided key information about  Mount Spurr during this activity.          Before the Eruption Episode on June 27, 1992      August 30, 1991    5:00 p.m. ADT     ""Forty small, shallow (approx. 3 km beneath crater) earthquakes  have been detected beneath Mt. Spurr in the last 2 weeks. Mt Spurr is  located approx. 130 km (80 miles) west of Anchorage. Most of the events  were located under Crater Peak, a basaltic-andesite cone of the Spurr  Volcanic Complex. The largest event was a MI = 1.4 on August 26th. The  largest number of events within one day occurred on August 22nd with 11  volcano-tectonic events. Since August 22nd, activity has slowed to 0-4  events per day.""     ""A small SO 2  signal was detected at Crater peak on  August 29th, whether this is significant or coincidental is not known.  Another flight is planned for Tuesday.""         February 7, 1992       ""Since late August AVO has recorded intermittent swarms of shallow  earthquakes beneath Crater Peak, a small basaltic-andesite cone located  on the south slope of Mt. Spurr. The most recent of these swarms began  on February 5. Earthquake magnitudes are generally less than 1.0, and  hypocenters range in depth from 0 to 3 km. This swarm activity is  slightly higher than normal, but is interpreted as simply a fluctuation  in background level. AVO will continue to monitor this seismic activity  closely.""      On March 13, 1992, AVO began to provide information about the seismic  activity at Mount Spurr in the weekly updates, which are issued every  Friday.             June 5, 1992    10:00 a.m. ADT     ""The level of seismic activity at Mt. Spurr has remained well  above normal. Since late August of 1991, AVO has detected an above  average number of small earthquakes beneath Mt. Spurr, the hypocenters  of which are generally between 0 and 5 km depth. Magnitudes of most of  the events are between 0 and 1.0, too small to be felt. Most of the  earthquakes form clusters beneath the summit and beneath Crater Peak,  on the south flank of the volcano. Earthquake swarms were recorded at  Mt. Spurr in 1982 and 1989. This abnormal seismic activity may  represent some form of magmatic activity at depth, possibly an  intrusion. Similar seismic activity has preceded eruptions at some  volcanoes yet, at others, seismicity has died off without an eruption.  No seismic activity thought to be typical of imminent eruption, such as  long-period events or tremor, have been recognized. AVO is in the  process of reviewing the nature and character of the activity beneath  Spurr. The most recent eruption of Mt. Spurr occurred in 1953.""             June 8, 1992     ""Over the past several months, the level of micro-earthquake  activity at Mt. Spurr volcano has increased significantly (i.e., an  order of magnitude) above that of the past 10 years. This increased  seismicity could represent early forerunner activity to an eruption.  However, it is at least as likely that the seismicity could remain at  this level indefinitely, or even decrease, without an eruption. An  overflight today suggested some changes in the thermal area at Crater  Peak, the site of the 1953 eruption. Our concern over the state of the  volcano is sufficiently high, therefore, that through this Update we  are sharing our interpretation of these recent changes at Spurr with  interested parties and reviewing AVO response plans.""     ""Mount Spurr volcano is the nearest active volcano to Anchorage  located 80 miles west of the city. The snow- and ice-mantled volcano  was most recently active in July 1953 when its only historic eruption  resulted in a day of explosive activity which deposited about 0.25  inches of ash on Anchorage. The actual site of the 1953 eruption was  not at the 10,000-foot-high summit of Spurr itself but rather at a  subsidiary cone, Crater Peak, located on the south flank of the volcano  at about 7,000 feet. This cone has been the site of about  15-ash-producing eruptions in the past 1,000 years. Crater Peak  contains a small turquoise colored hot-water lake with water  temperatures of about 130 o  F (55 o  C) and a small  fumarole (steam vent) field.""     ""Most of the earthquakes being recorded are considered to be  volcano-tectonic in origin ÷ that is, caused by fracture of  brittle rock. Much of the elevated seismicity since last August has  been beneath the main summit of Spurr and, more recently, Crater Peak.  None of the earthquakes has exceeded magnitude 1.7. We have seen no  evidence to suggest that the increase in seismicity is related to  regional earthquake activity rather than a localized volcanic  process.""     ""The recent increase of seismicity beneath Spurr may be the result  of some form of magmatic activity in the volcano's plumbing system,  possibly an ongoing episode of magma intrusion at depth. To date no  long-period events or volcanic tremor (two types of seismic activity  that usually mean an eruption is imminent) have been recognized.  However, over the past 72 hours, an increase in very localized seismic  activity has occurred immediately beneath Crater Peak; this may be  related to a change in the near-surface thermal activity. Our principal  concern at Spurr at the present time is monitor the activity in case it  develops into a short term (such as a 24-72 hour) pre-eruption  crisis.""     ""The seismicity level at Spurr can no longer be considered normal  in that it differs markedly from previous seismicity at Spurr, and also  differs from the character of normal background earthquake activity  observed at other Cook Inlet volcanoes. Increased seismic activity of  the type seen at Spurr has on occasion preceded eruptions from  volcanoes elsewhere by about two months; on the other hand, similar  earthquake swarms have been recorded beneath volcanoes that were not  followed by eruptions.""     ""An increase in the amount of sulfur dioxide being emitted from  volcanoes is another sign of possible eruptive activity. An airborne  gas sampling flight today indicated no increase over that measured in  October, 1991; however, a change in the color of the hot lake inside  the crater from turquoise-blue to black was noted. This type of change  has been noted in other volcano lakes owing to an increase in iron  sulfide and may reflect temperature changes in the near-surface thermal  areas.""     ""To reiterate, we have no reason to believe an eruption at Spurr  is imminent in the next few days. Because of the anomalous seismic  activity and change in the appearance of the lake, however, we are  responding as follows:     1. By copy of this Update, we are notifying interested parties to the  ongoing situation at Spurr.     2. Although we consider the volcano to be adequately instrumented with  the eight seismographs now in place, we are increasing the sensitivity  of the 24-hour alarm at the AVO Seismological Lab in Fairbanks to  respond to the seismicity at Spurr. The seismic records are also being  analyzed more frequently.     3. Routine airborne gas sampling and observation overflights will be  increased if significant premonitory changes in the seismicity occur.  Sampling of the fumaroles gases inside Crater Peak will be done in late  June, weather permitting.     4. Given the present lack of immediate precursor seismic activity at  Spurr, we believe it premature to implement a hazard color code similar  to that used the during the Redoubt crisis.     5. We will continue to issue Updates on Spurr activity as the situation  warrants.""            June 26, 1992    10:30 a.m. ADT     ""The level of seismic activity at Mt. Spurr has remained well  above normal this week and has increased slightly. The rate of  volcano-tectonic earthquakes--those caused by the fracture of brittle  rock--has fluctuated somewhat, and remains at elevated levels that have  persisted since August 1991. These events occur at depths of 0 to 5 km  beneath the summit region, and have magnitudes between 0 and 1.0, too  small to be felt. In addition, very localized seismic activity  continues to occur immediately beneath Crater Peak. This activity is  generally characterized by bursts of 1 to 10 minutes duration that show  up most strongly at the seismic stations closest to Crater Peak. Based  on comparison with similar events at other volcanoes, we are calling  these events tremor bursts. The sizes of the tremor bursts are small,  comparable to those that generally accompany hydrothermal activity.  Their rate of occurrence has fluctuated somewhat, and remains at  elevated levels. Two longer tremor bursts, each about 2 hours long,  occurred on June 24-25.""     ""The abnormal seismic activity may represent some form of magmatic  activity at depth, possibly an intrusion related to the increase in  geothermal activity. Similar seismic activity has preceded eruptions at  some volcanoes yet, at others, seismicity has died off without an  eruption. No seismic activity though to be typical of imminent  eruption, such as swarms of long-period events, has been recognized.  AVO is continually reviewing the nature and character of the activity  beneath Mt. Spurr. The most recent eruption of Mt. Spurr occurred in  1953.""            June 26, 1992    4:30 p.m. ADT     ""Since today's earlier Update, AVO scientists have observed an  increase level of seismic activity at Mt. Spurr located 75 miles west  of Anchorage. The character of seismic activity indicates that the  state of unrest in increasing, however, it does not suggest that an  eruption is imminent within the next few days. Long-period seismic  events, which are common in the days and hours before large volcanic  eruptions, have not yet been recognized.""     ""The largest episode of continuous seismic tremor seen to date  began at 12:04 p.m. ADT and is continuing at the time of this release.  The amplitude of the tremor is twice as large as that for any of the  previous episodes recorded at Mt. Spurr since bursts of tremor began on  June 6. The duration of this episode greatly exceeds that of all  previous episodes, including the two 2.5 hour- long bursts on June 24  and 25 that were reported in today's previous Update.""     ""An AVO geologist flew past Mt. Spurr at about 11:00 a.m. this  morning, and reported a decreased level in the lake compared to June 11  observations. The lowering of the lake may indicate increased heating  at the volcano.""     ""Explosive ejection of the crater lake or melting of fresh snow by  hot eruption products could likely cause localized debris flows. These  flows could become larger as they move downstream into the valley of  Chakachatna River and could present a hazard to persons near the stream  channel.""     ""Current wind directions for the next 24 hours indicate  trajectories to the north and northeast. The nearest towns are Skwentna  approximately 60 miles NE and Shirleyville 35 miles to ESE.""     ""A color code specific to Spurr volcano accompanies this update.  As of this update our present condition is yellow. This condition will  persist until Monday afternoon or until an additional update is  issued.""     ""In view of these new observations, AVO scientists are  intensifying their watch of Mt. Spurr commensurate with their increased  level of concern. AVO maintains a 24-hour computerized alarm system  which will alert observatory seismologists should unusual seismic  activity occur at any of the Cook Inlet volcanoes.""           Eruption Begins     On June 27, 1992, at 7:16 a.m. PDT, AVO initiated notification by phone  that an eruption began at 7:04 a.m. and changed the color code to  ORANGE.           June 27, 1992    8:00 a.m. ADT     ""A moderate explosive eruption occurred at Mt. Spurr at 7:04 a.m.  today. Pilots reported an ash plume which reached an altitude of 26,000  feet. Accordingly, AVO has raised the level of concern color code to  ORANGE. The explosion was preceded by volcanic tremor which began at  12:04 p.m. on June 26, and a swarm of volcano-tectonic  earthquakes--those caused by the brittle fracture of rock--which began  at roughly 3:00 a.m. These changes in seismicity suggest the movement  of magma at shallow depth.""     ""Based on the rapid and continuing changes in seismic activity  beneath Crater Peak there is an increased likelihood of continued  eruptive activity.

GX021-51-7553968	"Geology of Haleakala National Park           Haleakala     National Park    Hawaii                                                                           Haleakala Crater is now a cool, cone-studded reminder of a once-active volcano. Streaks of red, yellow, gray, and black trace the courses of recent and ancient lava, ash, and cinder flows. The volcanic rocks slowly break down as natural forces reduce them to minute particles which are swept away by wind, heavy rain, and intermittent streams.        A fiery birth beneath the sea  Modern geology indicates that the Hawaiian Islands are situated near the middle of the  Pacific Plate , one of a dozen thin, rigid structures covering our planet like the cracked shell of an egg. Though adjoining each other, these plates are in constant slow motion, the Pacific Plate moving northwestward several centimeters per year. Scattered around the world are many weak areas in the earth's crust where magma slowly wells upward to the surface as a ""plume"". Here volcanoes and volcanic islands, such as  Maui , are born.   This constant northwestward movement of the Pacific Plate over a local volcanic  ""hot spot"" , or plume, has produced a series of islands one after another in assembly line fashion. The result is a chain of volcanic islands stretching from the island of Hawaii along a southeast/northwest line for 4,050 kilometers (2,500 miles) toward Japan.    Mountains Above the Sea  Maui, one of the younger islands in this chain, began as two separate volcanoes on the ocean floor; time and again, eon after eon, they erupted and thin new sheets of lava spread upon the old, building and building until the volcano heads emerged from the sea.  Lava, wind-blown ash, and alluvium eventually joined the two by an  isthmus  or valley, forming Maui,  ""The Valley Isle"" .  Finally, Haleakala, the larger eastern volcano, reached its greatest height, 3,600 meters (12,000 feet) above the ocean - some 9,100 meters (30,000 feet) from its base on the ocean floor.     Waters Upon the Mountain  For a time, volcanic activity ceased, and erosion dominated.  The great mountain was high enough to trap the moisture-laden northeast tradewinds.  Rain fell and streams began to cut channels down its slopes.  Two such streams eroding their way headward created large amphitheater-like depressions near the summit.      Ultimately these two valleys met, creating a long erosional  ""crater"" .  At the same time a series of ice age submergences and emergences of the shoreline occurred; the final submergence formed the four islands of  Lanai ,  Molokai ,  Kahoolawe , and  Maui .    Lava Down the Valleys  When volcanic activity resumed near the summit, lava poured down the stream valleys, nearly filling them.  More recently, cinders, ash, volcanic bombs, and spatter were blown from the numerous young vents in the ""crater"" forming multi-colored symmetrical cones as high as 180 meters (600 feet).   Thus this water-carved basin became partially filled with lava and cinder cones, and it came to resemble a true volcanic crater.    Stillness Within the Volcano  Several hundred years have passed since the last volcanic activity occurred within the crater.  This stillness in Maui is attributed by modern geology to the constant northwestward movement of the pacific Plate.  As the oldest islands on the northwest end of the chain have moved farther away from the plume - the source of new lava -they have ceased to grow; the ravages of wind and rain and time have thus been able to reduce them to sandbars and atolls.   Maui has shifted a few kilometers from the plume's influence, and Haleakala, too, is destined to become extinct.  Though dormant now, about  1790 , which is quite recent in geologic time, two minor flows at lower elevations along the southwest rift zone of Haleakala reached the sea and altered the southwest coastline of Maui.  Today, earthquake records indicate the internal adjustments are still taking place in the earth's crust, but at present, no volcanic activity of any form is visible in the crater nor at any other place on the island of Maui.  Perhaps Haleakala could erupt again; we just don't know.   Though Maui is no longer growing, the youngest island in the chain, Hawaii, is enlarging.  And as plate drift continues, it is even probable that in the distant future, a new volcanic island will appear to the southeast of Hawaii, the Big Island.            top of page            Haleakala National Park home page Alaska Volcano Observatory   Association of American State Geologists home page       Glossary of Terms, and Geologic        Time Scale   Home Page of VolcanoWorld   19 May 1915 Eruption of Lassen Peak                  Publications                     Earthquakes    Eruptions of Hawaiian Volcanoes: Past, Present, and Future    Eruptions of Mount Saint Helens: Past, Present, and Future    Geologic Time (online edition)    Monitoring Active Volcanoes    The Severity of an Earthquake    Volcanic and Seismic Hazards on the Island of Hawaii (online edition)    Volcanoes    Volcanoes of the United States          WebSites     Cascades Volcano Observatory home page    Volcanoes in the Learning Web       top      of page                           If you have comments or would like more information, please contact  parkgeology@den.nps.gov    National Park Service, Geologic Resources Division   Last Updated December 16, 1997 by  Tim_Connors@nps.gov    grd/parks/hale/index.htm      You are visitor number  since December 16, 1997"

The volcano consists of a dramatic, 10-kilometer-diameter, 0.5 to 1.0-kilometer-deep  caldera  that formed during a catastrophic eruption 3,500 years ago. Since then, at least a dozen separate  vents  within the caldera have erupted, often explosively, to produce  lava  flows and widespread  tephra  ( ash ) deposits. The most recent eruption at Aniakchak occurred in 1931 and was one of the largest  explosive eruptions  in Alaska in the last 100 years. Although Aniakchak volcano presently shows no signs of unrest, explosive and nonexplosive eruptions will occur in the future. Awareness of the hazards posed by future eruptions is a key factor in minimizing impact.

GX034-47-3361273	"Hot Heads    Volcanoes are close cousins of earthquakes, arising as they do from the same powerful motions of the planet's tectonic plates. Despite their fiery reputation for chaos and destruction, however, only about sixty volcanoes erupt each year. What's more,   most volcanoes are on the ocean floor where plate boundaries are converging or spreading over ""hot spots""—large subterranean pools of magma.   This is not to say that volcanoes pose no peril. Over the last 300 years more than 260,000 people have died from volcanic activity. The 1991 eruption of the Philippines' Mount Pinatubo killed more than 300 people and devastated the area's economy. When Mount St. Helen's blew its stack in the State of Washington in 1980, 57 people died, nearly 7,000 big game animals were killed, more than 12 million salmon perished, forests were devastated, and the economy took a nearly $1 billion hit.   All of this reinforces the need for better ways to model and predict volcanic activity. One way to both study and monitor a volcano is to place a gas sensing device called COSPEC along the volcano's flanks. COSPEC (for ""correlation spectrometer"") measures how much sulfur dioxide gas is escaping from the volcano's interior. A jump in the amount of sulfur dioxide suggests an imminent eruption. Still, a few hours' or, at most, a few days' warning is the best that scientists can manage with current knowledge and technology. And sometimes, of course, there is no discernible warning at all.   In 1993, nine members of a scientific expedition who were taking gas samples died when a sudden spasm of molten rock and ash erupted from the crater of a volcano called Galeras in Colombia. The tragedy prompted one of the survivors, Stanley Williams of Arizona State University, to organize a conference that would enable scientists to standardize their methods and make data consistent from one volcano observatory to another. The 1997  NSF-funded  conference brought together virtually every scientist then working with COSPEC—some 25 volcanologists from 14 countries. Williams has also developed a remote-access instrument called GASPEC that measures another early-warning gas, carbon dioxide.   Other volcano-monitoring efforts funded in part by NSF include a network of seismometers (instruments that measure ground vibrations caused by earthquakes) and an array of Earth-orbiting satellites called the Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS can alert scientists to volcano-related ground deformations at the millimeter scale—deformations that might signal an imminent eruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                            Search    |    Site map    |    NSF Home    |    OLPA Home     |    Questions  |"
GX009-78-4464042	"USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington                  Volcanic Gas        Kenneth A. McGee and Terrence M. Gerlach, 1995,  Volcanic Gas:  USGS Open-File Report 95-85             In Roman mythology, Vulcan, the god of fire, was said to have made tools and weapons for the other gods in his workshop at Olympus. Throughout history, volcanoes have frequently been identified with Vulcan and other mythological figures. Scientists now know that the ""smoke"" from volcanoes, once attributed by poets to be from Vulcan's forge, is actually volcanic gas naturally released from both active and many inactive volcanoes.        The molten rock, or magma, that lies beneath volcanoes and fuels eruptions, contains abundant gases that are released to the surface before, during, and after eruptions. These gases range from relatively benign low-temperature steam to thick hot clouds of choking sulfurous fume jetting from the earth.        Water vapor is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Other volcanic gases are hydrogen sulfide, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrofluoric acid, and other trace gases and volatile metals. The concentrations of these gas species can vary considerably from one volcano to the next.              [Graphic,108K,JPG]     Figure 1.      Large volcanic eruptions inject water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and pumice) into the stratosphere. CO2 is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming. HCl and HF can dissolve in water and fall to the earth as acid rain. Most of the SO2 is slowly converted to sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which condenses into a mist of fine particles. These sulfate aerosols reflect radiation from the Sun, cooling the troposphere; they also absorb the Earth's heat, warming the stratosphere. The aerosols also promote ozone destruction by altering chlorine and nitrogen chemical species in the stratosphere. As the aerosols settle down into the upper troposphere, they can serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds, further affecting the Earth's radiation balance. (figure modified from Richard Turco in American Geophysical Union Special Report: Volcanism and Climate Change, May 1992)              WHY STUDY VOLCANIC GAS?      A famous Japanese geochemist, Sadao Matsuo, once said that ""Volcanic gas is a telegram from the earth's interior."" By studying volcanic gases, volcanologists hope to recognize changes in abundance or composition that might signal reawakening of a dormant volcano or portend an imminent eruption at an already restless volcano.       Another significant component of volcanic gas research involves measuring the quantities of gas that volcanoes release to the atmosphere. Huge amounts of volcanic gas, aerosol droplets, and ash are injected into the stratosphere during major explosive eruptions. Some gases, such as carbon dioxide, contribute to global warming, while others, like sulfur dioxide, can cause global cooling and ozone destruction. Studies of volcanic emissions will allow scientists to compare volcanic gas output to emissions from man-made sources and to assess the effects of both past and future eruptions on Earth's climate.      IS VOLCANIC GAS HAZARDOUS?      Yes, volcanic gas can be harmful to humans, animals, plants, agricultural crops, and property. Usually, the hazards from volcanic gases are restricted to the areas immediately surrounding volcanic vents and fumaroles and to low spots on the flanks of volcanoes. But these hazards can sometimes persist for long distances downwind from a volcano.       Health hazards can range from minor to life threatening. Exposure to acid gases such as sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrochloric acid can damage eyes and mucous membranes along with the respiratory system and, under extreme conditions, can lead to death. The toxicity of carbon monoxide is well known, although it is rarely abundant enough to cause serious problems. One of the most serious hazards occurs when volcanoes emit large quantities of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and collects in low spots, displacing air in these locations. Hundreds of people have died of carbon dioxide asphyxiation near volcanoes in the past two decades, most of them in Cameroon, Africa, and in Indonesia.       Volcanic gases can also severely damage vegetation. Direct exposure to concentrated volcanic gas or long-term exposure to dilute volcanic gas has a lethal effect on most types of foliage.      Fume clouds from volcanoes also contain water droplets in which acid gases have dissolved. These droplets eventually fall to earth as acid rain. Utility lines, farm equipment, cars, and other metal objects corrode when exposed to volcanic gases or acid rain. Persistent acid rain causes galvanized nails or lead solder in water catchment systems to deteriorate and release heavy metals into drinking water. Hydrofluoric acid gas emitted from a volcano can attach itself to ash particles. When these particles fall to earth, there can be serious consequences if ingested by grazing animals.    HOW ARE VOLCANIC GASES STUDIED?      Customarily, gases are collected directly from volcanic fumaroles (vents), then transported to an analytical laboratory for detailed chemical analysis.       A new approach involves installing chemical sensors in or near volcanic vents and linking them to radio telemetry devices to provide a continuous readout on one or more gases. This method can detect significant short-term releases of gas that will usually be missed by occasional sampling.        Finally, emissions of certain gases can be measured in the plume discharging from a volcano. Scientists use an optical spectrometer mounted in an airplane and flown through or beneath a volcanic plume or in a satellite measuring the plume from space. This equipment provides a measure of the total output of one or more gases and is useful in understanding how much volcanic gas is released into the atmosphere.              [Image,71K,JPG]      U.S. Geological Survey geochemists sampling gases from the dome at Mount St. Helens.                WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?      Studies by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have revealed the compositions and amounts of gases released from several active volcanoes in the U.S. (Alaska, Cascades, Hawaii). As an example, USGS scientists studying the gases of Mount St. Helens have determined that about 2 million tons of sulfur dioxide were emitted between 1980 and 1988. Sensors aboard a satellite detected about 1 million tons of sulfur dioxide injected into the stratosphere during the main eruption on May 18, 1980. Another half-million tons of sulfur dioxide was dissolved in water droplets attached to ash particles that eventually fell to earth. The remaining half-million tons was emitted from the volcano during the eight years following the initial eruption. These measurements allow important comparisons with sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants and other man-made sources.       Careful study of Mount St. Helens' gases using chemical sensors installed on the dome along with airborne measurements of sulfur dioxide revealed periods of increased gas emission prior to four dome-building eruptions during 1984-86. This observation is an important first step in developing the ability to predict eruptions by monitoring gases.        In summary, the study of volcanic gases contributes important new information related to global climate change and may lead to the development of an effective tool for predicting volcanic eruptions.

GX032-90-3358312	Earth Sciences 10   Lecture 10   Igneous Rocks II   Volcanism   Greg Anderson            This lecture continues from the discussion of igneous rocks in  Lecture 9 , concentrating on volcanoes and related issues.    Volcano World  is a fantastic online resource on volcanoes of all kinds.  Two others are the web pages of the  Cascade Volcanoes Observatory (CVO)  and the general  USGS volcanoes page .   Please note there are lots of outside links in this set of notes; primarily they point to the pictures I used in lecture, but others are to give additional information.  Read through the notes, but follow only those links which deal with subjects you want to know more about.      What is a volcano?      A volcano is a hill, mountain, or plateau which is formed from accumulated igneous materials which erupt at the surface from a vent or vents.   Your ``typical'' volcano is a steep-sided cone of alternating layers of lava and pyroclastics (see below), with a crater at the top.  Below the surface, there is a chamber containing magma from which a ``chimney'' leads toward the crater.  This chimney is the duct through which magma reaches the surface and erupts.   Figures 5.1, 5.10, 5.12, and 5.14 from  Understanding Earth  show generalized diagrams of the internal structure of various types of volcanoes.    Here  is an online version from   Volcano World .      Volcanic Deposits      As volcanoes erupt, they generate two major kinds of deposits: lavas and  pyroclastics.       Lavas         As you will recall from Lecture 7, lava is molten or partially molten         rock which has erupted at the surface, and there are a few major        different kinds.                  Basaltic lavas  are very hot (1000-1200 °C; 1800-2200 °F)        and fluid.  They can flow up to 60 km/hr and travel many km from their        sources.  Basaltic lava takes on characteristic forms as it cools and        hardens:                               Pahoehoe         Smooth, ropy flows that often look something like a small rug         which has been wrinkled.                                'A'a         Flows made of individual small, rough chunks called clinkers.                                Pillow lava         When basalt erupts underwater, its outer surface cools almost        instantly.  The hot pressurized interior still wants to flow, so        it breaks out (and the surface cools again, and breakouts happen        again...).  The process looks something like squeezing toothpaste        out of a tube, pausing, then squeezing again, and builds up         lobes of frozen lava called pillow lavas.                        Flood Basalts         Very hot and fluid basalt which erupts from a long set of cracks        in the Earth's surface makes thin flows which can travel long        distances.  With lots of repeated flows, basaltic lava plateaus        like those in eastern Washington and Oregon are formed.                           Felsic lavas  are cooler than basalts when they erupt (500-800        °C or 900-1500 °F), and are not as fluid, so they don't tend        to flow.  Often they build                 lava domes  in the craters of the volcanoes from which they erupt.          Pyroclastics         The name means ``fire-broken'', and pyroclastics are fragments of         volcanic material ejected during an eruption (also called         tephra ).  They can range in size from very small to         house-sized, and are classified by size:                                Ash                 Individual pieces less than 2 mm in diameter.                      Lapilli          Pea- to gravel-sized fragments (2-64 mm in diameter).                            Bombs          Chunks greater than 64 mm in diameter which were liquid when         erupted.  Bombs often look like footballs.                            Blocks          Chunks greater than 64 mm in diameter which were solid when         erupted (usually old lavas blown away).                   Some volcanoes gurgle and others go KABOOM!      The type of lava a volcano erupts controls how the volcano erupts.         Mafic/basaltic lavas: lots of olivine and pyroxene, which (remember         Bowen's reaction series from chapter 4) melt at very high temperatures.        Also, the minerals in basalt lavas give those lavas a relatively low        silica content.  Finally, olivine and pyroxene have fairly simple        crystal structures.                 High melting temp + low silica + simple crystal structures => low        viscosity          Rhyolitic/felsic lavas: lots of quartz and feldspars which melt at         fairly low temperatures (Bowen again) and are high in silica.  Also,        these minerals are framework silicates which have fairly complex        crystal structures.                 High silica + low melting temp + complex crystal structures=> high         viscosity     With low viscosity, dissolved gas can escape from basalt relatively easily, and volcanoes which erupt basalts tend to gurgle relatively calmly.   With high viscosity, dissolved gas can't escape very easily and can build extreme pressures.  Those volcanoes which erupt felsic lavas, particularly rhyolite, tend to go  KABOOM!       Eruption Types and Volcanic Landforms      There are many ways of classifying volcanic eruptions;  I've chosen to use the following.  This list is in order of increasing eruptive violence.         Icelandic/Fissure         Highly fluid basaltic lava erupts from long cracks called fissures         Usually not explosive         These eruptions build very low, broad volcanoes and         lava plateaus                  Examples:                       Hekla  and                Laki  in Iceland               Columbia River Flood Basalt Province  in Oregon and Washington        (maybe)   Deccan Traps  in India (maybe)                   Hawaiian         Fluid basaltic lava erupts (primarily, but not only) from a central        vent.  There often can be fissure eruptions as well.         Usually not explosive         These eruptions build          shield volcanoes                  Example:              Kilauea and Mauna Loa  on     the island of Hawaii (and, in fact, all the Hawaiian Islands).                   Strombolian         More viscous lava (can be basaltic or felsic) erupts from a        central vent and cools into cinders         Usually only mildly/moderately explosive         These eruptions build                  cinder cones  (see Figure 5.12 in the textbook).                  Examples:              Amboy Crater  in the Mojave Desert             Stromboli  in Italy.  Stromboli has been erupting nearly        continuously for 2000 years and is known as the ``Lighthouse of        the Mediterranean'' for that reason.                   Vulcanian         Moderately violent eruptions of pyroclastic materials and lavas from a         central vent.        Vulcanian eruptions build          stratovolcanoes , which are more or less the average person's image        of a volcano.  Stratovolcanoes often are made of multiple overlapping         volcanic cones and have more than one crater, and internally are         composed of alternating (more or less) layers of lavas and pyroclastic         deposits.  Stratovolcanoes are the most common kind of volcano and are         usually found around subduction zones; they usually erupt felsic         material, but many erupt more mafic-to-intermediate materials.                 Examples:                             Sakura-jima  in Japan            Mayon  in the Philippines                   Pelean         Very violent eruptions, which usually eject material laterally in                 pyroclastic flows .  Pyroclastic flows are extremely fast-moving         (up to 200 km/hr) and very hot (up to 1500 °F) clouds of dust, ash,         and gas which flow downhill.  These happen at stratovolcanoes, mostly.                 Example:                      Mount Pelee  on Martinique.  Pelean eruptions are named for        the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelee which killed about 29000 people        in the city of St. Pierre.  The people were killed by a        pyroclastic flow which overwhelmed the city.  Plenty of other        volcanoes erupt this way on occasion.                     Plinian         The most violent kind of eruption, extremely explosive.  These        happen at stratovolcanoes and can destroy them, creating calderas         (calderas are craters > 1 km in diameter).        The primary feature which distinguishes Plinian from Pelean eruptions        is that Plinian eruptions feature columns of pyroclastics rising 10s        of km above the volcano, and that  enormous  volumes of         pyroclastics are erupted (up to 1000s of cubic km).        Some Plinian eruptions are so powerful they can change the climate        for years at a time.                 Examples:                      The 18 May 1980 eruption at Mt St. Helens                     700,000 years ago near Mammoth Lakes                     Yellowstone Caldera                     The 79 A.D. eruption of Mt. Vesuvius .  This eruption was        observed and described by Pliny the Younger (hence the name        Plinian).            A Plinian eruption of the Greek volcano          Santorini  in 1650 B.C. resulted in much of the island being        blown away and sinking into the sea, probably ended the Minoan         civilization, and may be the source of the Atlantis myth.              Note that most volcanoes erupt similar kinds of material over time, but may erupt in different manners during different eruptions, and may, in fact, display different types of behavior during different stages of a single eruptive sequence.  Basically, as with all classification schemes, there are always exceptions.      Volcanoes and Plate Tectonics      Volcanoes tend to form in three major environments: divergent and convergent plate boundaries and hot spots.  Certain types of volcanism are common in certain of these three environments:       Divergent Boundaries         Basalt volcanism forms dikes and pillows         These make new oceanic crust         Example:  Mid-Atlantic Ridge          Convergent Boundaries         Mafic-to-felsic volcanism         (note that felsic igneous rocks are made primarily at ocean-  continent subduction zones)         Intrusives and explosive volcanoes, often stratovolcanoes         Review last lecture and the book to see how the felsic material        forms from subducting oceanic plates and sediments.         Examples:  Cascades, Andes, Aleutian Islands, Japan          Hot spots         A plume of very hot material from the base of the mantle rises        through the mantle to the surface, ``burns'' through lithosphere,        erupts at surface.         Usually basaltic lavas         Typically form shield volcanoes, perhaps flood basalts                  Hot spots are believed to be relatively fixed in the mantle.  As a        plate moves over a fixed hot spot, a chain of volcanoes may result         through eruptions of material from the hot spot.  The Hawaiian         Islands/Emperor Seamount chain is a perfect example.   See figures 5.28, 5.29, and 5.30 in the book for relevant diagrams.

GX032-74-0864389	"Recent developments in aviation and volcanic ash   Excerpt from:  Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety: Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety , U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 2047. For sale by U.S. Geological Survey, Map Distribution, Box 25286, MS 306, Denver, CO   80225      by Thomas J. Casadevall, Ph.D. U.S. Geological Survey, Box 25046, MS 903/Denver Federal Center/Denver, CO 80225     For a history of how aviation has coped with volcanic ash hazards, see  Aviation and the Effects of Volcanic Ash .    This information does not necessarily represent the position of the U.S. government, the Department of Transportation or the Federal Aviation Administration    Introduction    Volcanic ash from the 1989-90 eruptions of Redoubt Volcano disrupted aviation operations in south-central Alaska and damaged five jet passenger aircraft, including a new Boeing 747-400, which cost in excess of $80 million to repair (Steenblik, 1990).  The Redoubt eruptions served to increase interest by the aviation community in volcanic hazards and made it clear that mitigating the hazards of volcanic ash to aviation safety would require the cooperation and efforts of volcanologists, meteorologists, air traffic managers, engine and airframe manufacturers, and pilots.   Soon after the December 1989 eruptions of Redoubt, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska requested that Federal agencies form an interdepartmental task force to develop and coordinate both an immediate and a long-term response to the Redoubt eruptions.  In March 1990, in response to this request, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), formed an intermediary task group and began planning for an international technical symposium to review the available information about volcanic ash clouds and to assess what was being done to address the ash hazard both domestically and internationally.  This interagency group received strong support from the aviation community, and the Federal agencies were soon joined by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), the Air Transport Association (ATA), the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF), and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).  An important early result from this cooperation was the ""First International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety,"" to address the effects of volcanic activity on aviation safety in a multidisciplinary way and at a global scale.  The aims of the symposium were: to bring together individuals who were interested in the volcanic ash problem but who may have been unaware of other scientists, engineers, pilots, and aviation authorities with similar interests; to encourage and define needed improvements in the detection, tracking, and warning of volcanic ash hazard so that aircraft may avoid ash clouds; and to review the effects of volcanic ash on aircraft so that pilots who encounter ash can respond appropriately.  The symposium was held in Seattle, Wash., from July 8-12, 1991.   The symposium was attended by more than 200 participants from 28 countries, representing the major air carriers, airplane and engine manufacturers, pilots and aviation safety organizations, air traffic managers, meteorologists, and volcanologists.  More than 100 technical presentations were made during the symposium, including a special session on the effects on aviation operations of the June 15, 1991, eruption of Mt.  Pinatubo in the Philippines (Casadevall, 1991).  Field trips to the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control facility in Auburn, Wash., to the Boeing 737 assembly plant in Renton, Wash., and to the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument gave participants the opportunity to view the volcanic hazard aviation problem from several perspectives.  Such broad participation demonstrated a clear need and wide support for a meeting of this type.   In the past 15 years, more than 80 jet airplanes have been damaged owing to unplanned encounters with drifting clouds of volcanic ash in air routes and at airports.  Seven of these encounters caused in-flight loss of jet engine power, which nearly resulted in the crash of the airplane.  The repair and replacement costs associated with airplane ash cloud encounters are high and, to date (May 1994), have exceeded $200 million.  In addition to the high economic costs of these encounters, more than 1,500 passengers aboard the seven airliners that temporarily lost engine power were put at severe risk.   The hazard is compounded by the fact that volcanic ash clouds are not detectable by the present generation of radar instrumentation carried aboard aircraft and are not likely to be detectable in the foreseeable future.  Complete avoidance of volcanic ash clouds is the only procedure that guarantees flight safety, and this avoidance requires communication between the pilot and observers outside the aircraft.   Since the Seattle meeting, eruptions at Pinatabo, Sakurajima Volcano (Japan), Pacaya Volcano (Guatemala), Galeras Volcano (Colombia), Hudson and Lascar Volcanoes (Chile), Mt.  Spurr (Alaska), Nyamuragira Volcano (Zaire), Sheveluch Volcano (Russia), and Manam Volcano (Papua New Guinea) have further disrupted air traffic, damaged aircraft in flight, and delayed flights and curtailed operations at a number of airports.  The issue of volcanic hazards and aviation safety continues to be timely and in need of more effort if we are going to improve the margin of flight safety in the presence of volcanic ash.    Issues and needs   During the symposium, discussions focused on the following technical areas: the 1989-90 Redoubt eruptions and their impacts on aviation operations, the nature of volcanoes and their ash clouds, the effects of volcanic ash on aircraft, methods and procedures of communicating the ash-cloud hazard to pilots, the role of meteorology and the use of atmospheric models to forecast cloud movement, and detection and tracking of ash clouds, This volume contains reports for 60 of the 108 technical presentations made during the symposium.  The papers presented about the Redoubt eruptions have been published elsewhere (Miller and Chouet, 1994).   In addition to the technical presentations, symposium discussions identified a number of key issues and needs that participants felt must be addressed in order to mitigate the volcanic threat to aviation safety.  These included:    1. Improved communications among volcano observers. meteorologists, air traffic controllers, flight dispatchers, and pilots about drifting ash clouds, including immediate notification of volcanic eruptions to pilots.    2. Improved education of pilots, flight managers, and manufacturers about the ash-cloud hazard, including specific recommendations for avoiding ash clouds.    3. Improved detection and tracking of ash-cloud movement using remote-sensing techniques and atmospheric-transport models.    4. Improved monitoring of the Earth's active volcanoes, especially in the remote Aleutian-Kamchatka-Kurile volcanic region.    5. New methods for eruption identification and ashcloud detection.    6. Development of instruments that will enable pilots to detect ash clouds while in flight, especially useful when flying over remote, unmonitored regions of the Earth.    7. Development of better methods to remove and clean ash from airplanes and airports.    8. Determination of minimum levels of ash concentration that are capable of damaging aircraft and engines.    9. Development of a worldwide notification system and clearinghouse for information about active volcanoes, including planning charts to show the location of volcanoes relative to air routes.    Developments since the Symposium   A number of ad hoc working groups were formed following the symposium to examine these topics and have produced significant progress on many of these technical issues.  Accomplishments include:    1. A training video for pilots entitled ""Volcanic Ash Avoidance,"" produced by the Boeing Company in cooperation with the Air Line Pilots Association and the U.S. Geological Survey (Boeing Company, 1992).    2. An international workshop on communications among volcanologists, meteorologists, air traffic managers, and pilots was held in Washington, D.C., in September 1992.    3. An FAA review on aviation safety as affected by volcanic ash (FAA, 1993a).    4. A workshop on the dynamics and characteristics of the ash clouds from the 1992 eruptions of Mt.  Spurr was held in Washington, D.C., in April 1993 (FAA, 1993b).    5. An international workshop on volcanic ash and airports was held in Seattle, Wash. (Casadevall, 1993).     6. New communications links with Russia for warnings and information about Kamchatkan volcanoes, which underlie the increasingly busy air routes of the north Pacific region, were established in 1993 (NEller and Kirianov, 1993).    7. An interagency plan for volcanic ash episodes in Alaska was put into effect by the FAA, NWS, USGS, Department of Defense, and the State of Alaska in 1993 (Alaska Interagency Operating Plan, 1993).    8. A global planning chart showing the position of active volcanoes relative to air routes and air navigation aids was published (Casadevall and Thompson, 1994).    International efforts   Since 1982, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has worked to address the volcanic threat to aviation safety worldwide (Fox, 1988, this volume).  This threat came to wide public attention in 1982 when two 747 passenger jets encountered ash at night from separate eruptions of Galunggung Volcano in Indonesia.  In these incidents, volcanic ash extensively damaged exterior surfaces, instruments, and engines, resulting in the loss of thrust and powerless descents of nearly 25,000 feet before the pilots of both aircraft restarted their engines and landed safely at Jakarta (Smith, 1983).  The Galunggung encounters occurred for two main reasons.  First the pilots were unable to see the ash or to otherwise detect it using on-board instruments, and second, no warnings about the activity of the volcano were contained in the aeronautical information generally available to pilots, such as notices of significant meteorological events-SIGMET's    or in notices to airmen    NOTAMs.  These incidents led in 1982 to the formation of a volcanic ash warning group under leadership of the ICAO.   Eruptions and aircraft encounters with ash clouds during the past 15 years have prompted several other important international efforts to mitigate the volcanic hazard to aviation safety.  Because volcanic ash clouds are carried by upper-level winds and often cross national boundaries as well as boundaries separating flight-information regions, efficient and prompt communications between regions are essential to avoiding encounters.  The May 1985 encounter between a jumbo jet and an ash cloud from an eruption of Soputan Volcano in Indonesia prompted the Indonesian and Australian governments to form a bilateral volcanological/airspace liaison committee to improve communications about volcanic eruptions in the Indonesian region (Johnson and Casadevall, this volume).  In North America, drifting ash clouds from the 1989-90 eruptions of Redoubt Volcano, and the 1992 eruptions of Mt. Spurr, sent ash clouds over Canada and disrupted operations in Canadian airspace.  These incidents prompted establishment of close bilateral communications between Canadian and U.S. agencies including volcanologists, meteorologists, and air traffic controllers (Hickson, this volume).   In 1988, ICAO member states adopted regulations to provide alerts to pilots about eruptive activity worldwide.  These efforts included a special volcanic activity report form (VAR), which requires that pilots make a number of critical observations about the location on, timing, and nature of an ash cloud.  This information is communicated directly to the nearest area control center and is introduced into the communication network so that other aircraft may avoid airspace contaminated by volcanic ash (Fox, 1988, this volume).   Also in 1988, the World Organization of Volcano Observatories (WOVO), in cooperation with ICAO and with the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI), requested WOVO member institutions to establish contacts with civil aviation authorities to improve communications between ground-based observatories and air traffic in order to minimize the volcanic hazards to aircraft.  Currently, WOVO is examining ways to improve the exchange of information between observatories and agencies concerned with aviation operations, including the use of electronic mail (Richle and Fink, 1993).   Following the 1991 Seattle symposium, ICAO addressed the volcanic threat to aviation safety at regional meetings in Bangkok (September 1992) and Mexico City (October 1992).  In November 1992, changes to the international standards and recommended practices for meteorological services (ICAO, 1992) went into effect.  The changes relate to the types of information about volcanic clouds that are entered into aeronautical communications networks using the SIGMET mechanism.  The new regulations require that a volcanic advisory forecast be issued every 4 hours regarding the status of a volcanic cloud, with a 12-hour forecast of ash-cloud behavior.   Information for these advisories could come from many sources, but would most likely come from analysis of satellite images and from analysis of ash-cloud movement using atmospheric-transport models (Stunder and Heffter, this volume; Tanaka, this volume).  For example, an important source of information for these volcanic advisories for the Southwest Asia region is the Darwin Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre, established in 1993 by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.  The Darwin center utilizes satellite imagery to provide outlook advisory information about the occurrence and movement of ash clouds from eruptions in the Indonesian region.  The center also serves as a venue for training meteorologists from the Asian region about detection and tracking of volcanic ash clouds so other countries in the region might carry out similar analysis at the local level.   To further assist ICAO member states in meeting the requirements for more detailed advisories, ICAO established a special implementation project to member states with active volcanoes as well as to those states responsible for flight information in regions adjacent to areas with active volcanoes.  Through this project, an ICAO team consisting of a volcanologist and an aeronautical meteorologist visited countries in the Asia-Pacific region in 1992-93 (Casadevall and Oliveira, 1993) and the South American region in 1993-94 to advise on methods for meeting the new ICAO regulations.  The new regulations should result in more rapid and clearer communications about volcanic ash clouds to the aviation community.   In addition to these bilateral efforts to improve the speed and quality of information, several countries have addressed specific volcanic threats to aviation operations by applying existing technology and by seeking to develop new methods and equipment for ash detection.  For example, in 1991, scientists and aviation authorities in Japan installed specialized seismic and infrasonic detectors at Sakurajima Volcano to detect ash-producing eruptions.  Results from these sensors are continuously transmitted to nearby Kagoshima Airport to provide real-time notification of explosive eruptions that threaten airport operations (Kamo and others, this volume; Onodera and Kamo, this volume).  In another example, scientists in Australia are seeking ways to supplement information that is available to the pilot by developing an ash-detection sensor that can be carried onboard the aircraft to detect the presence of ash in the flight path (Barton and Prata, this volume; Prata and Barton, this volume).  Such a sensor would be especially valuable for international flights over regions where volcanoes are poorly monitored and where ground-based communications are poorly established.    Efforts in the United States   The United States has approximately 56 volcanoes with historical eruptive activity; 44 are located in Alaska.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the principal Federal agency with responsibility for assessing volcanic hazards and monitoring active volcanoes in the United States (Wright and Pierson, 1992).  This work is carried out primarily from volcano observatories in Hawaii, Alaska, California, and Washington.  For example, the Alaska Volcano Observatory monitors the activity of volcanoes in the Cook Inlet area, including Redoubt and Spurr.  Continuous seismic and other monitoring of these volcanoes, day and night, in all seasons and weather conditions, enables volcanologists to detect eruption precursors as well as eruptions themselves.  Early detection of eruptions and prompt communication of this information to the FAA and to the National Weather Service offices in Anchorage are an essential part of the role played by USGS scientists in mitigating the ash hazard to aircraft.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also have responsibilities for dealing with the hazard of volcanic ash clouds that affect aviation operations in the United States.  Cooperation between these two agencies was formalized shortly before the December 1989 eruption of Redoubt, when a memorandum of understanding between the agencies created a volcanic hazard alert team and established procedures to respond to volcanic eruptions affecting air operations in the United States.  Since 1989, these procedures have been activated for eight volcanoes in the United States (J.  Lynch, NOAA-SAB, written common., March 1993).  In 1993, a letter of agreement between the USGS and NOAA attempted to speed the exchange of information that notifies the aviation community of ash-cloud hazards and formalized the de facto collaboration between these agencies that has existed since the Redoubt eruptions.   The principal tools used by NOAA for assessing volcanic activity are analysis of data from satellites (Krueger and others, this volume; Matson and others, this volume) and wind-field data, which enables the forecast of drifting ash clouds (Murray and others, this volume; Stunder and Heffter, this volume).  Since 1990, the National Weather Service office in Anchorage has implemented several new techniques for detecting and tracking volcanic ash clouds from volcanoes in the Cook Inlet and Aleutian regions (Hufford, this volume).  These efforts are integrated with the monitoring efforts of the Alaska Volcano Observatory and with the air-traffic-control efforts of the FAA.  The FAA, through its area control centers, has the primary responsibility for communicating with pilots and for providing NOTAMs.   Following the 1989-90 eruptions of Redoubt, the 1992 eruptions of Mt.  Spurr also had an important impact on aviation, affecting operations in Alaska, Canada, and the conterminous United States (Alaska Volcano Observatory, 1993).  Ashfall from the August 18, 1992, eruption of Mt.  Spurr deposited from 1 to 3 mm of ash in Anchorage and caused Anchorage airports to curtail operations for several days (Casadevall, 1993).  The cost of airport cleanup alone in Anchorage from the August 18 ashfall was more than $650,000.  The ash cloud from the September 17 eruption disrupted air traffic routing around the volcano.  Two days later it disrupted air routes over western Canada and in the congested air corridors of the northeastern United States.  Fortunately, there were no encounters between aircraft and the drifting Spurr ash clouds.  The lack of damage encounters following the Spurr eruptions reflects increased awareness about the hazards of ash clouds and improvements made since 1990 in the warning, detection, and tracking of volcanic clouds.  These improvements are largely a direct result of the previously mentioned initiatives by Federal and international agencies to reduce the hazards from volcanic ash.   From an operational perspective, experience in the Australia-Indonesia region and in Alaska has indicated that the threat of volcanic ash can be effectively addressed at the regional or local level.  For example. the 1989-90 Redoubt eruptions and the 1992 Spurr eruptions prompted Federal and State agencies in Alaska to establish a regional plan for aviation-related volcanic hazards (Alaska Interagency Operation Plan. 1993).  The plan outlines the responsibilities of the agencies involved in eruption responses to meet the publics need for information to protect against volcanic ash hazards.  The Redoubt and Spurr eruptions also prompted U.S. and Canadian agencies to refine bilateral operational plans for communicating about volcanic hazards (Hickson, this volume).   In addition to the efforts by international and Federal agencies, the major airplane and jet engine manufacturers have also studied the damage to aircraft from ash encounters to efforts to develop mitigation strategies, including practical steps for pilots to minimize damage should an ash cloud be entered accidentally.  The manufacturer's principal trade association, the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), formed a volcanic ash study committee in 1991 to evaluate the volcanic threat to aviation safety (AIA Propulsion Committee, this volume).  The findings of this committee are reflected in a number of the reports presented in Seattle (Campbell, this volume; Dum and Wade, this volume; Przedpelski and Casadevall, this volume).   The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the Air Transport Association (ATA) and the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) as well as the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and the American Industries Association (AIA) have all taken active roles to communicate about the ash problem with their members and constituents, both nationally and internationally.  ALPA and ATW were sponsors of the Seattle Symposium, along with the FAA, NOAA, and the USGS.  AIA, AIAA, FSF, IAVCEI, and the National Transportation Safety Board were co-sponsors of the symposium.    Future directions   As we gain understanding about the nature of ash clouds and the hazard of volcanic ash to aviation operations, we constantly improve our abilities to deal with the threat (Casadevall, 1992).  Multidisciplinary cooperation and communications were major factors in the success of the Seattle meeting.  This cooperation created an excitement among the participants that has been kept alive at later workshops and in cooperative efforts such as the production of the Boeing training video (Boeing Company, 1992).  Even though the ash-aviation safety problem is global in scope, the solutions that have worked best have often been on a local or regional scale.  The optimal solutions require understanding the location and character of the nearby active volcanoes, the structure of the air routes that cross or pass by these volcanoes, and an understanding and use of all available resources to detect, track, and forecast the movement of ash clouds.  At the same time, as new pilots are introduced to new routes efforts to educate pilots must continue.   The Seattle symposium and the efforts following the symposium indicate that we have much to do to satisfactorily address concerns about the threat of volcanic ash to aviation safety.  This requires application of existing technologies, such as methods that enable scientists to detect eruptions from remote, unmonitored volcanoes; early detection of ash clouds; tracking of ash clouds in real time; and development of better and faster ways to get information into the cockpit.  Also, despite the recent advances in testing jet engines for their tolerances to volcanic ash (Dunn and Wade, this volume) and advances in using remote-sensing technologies to detect and track ash clouds (Schneider and Rose, this volume; Wen and Rose, 1994), it is essential that ash clouds be sampled directly as they drift from their source volcanoes (Riehle and others, 1994).  Only direct sampling will allow us to obtain information with which to corroborate and validate laboratory tests and computational models.  The results of the Seattle symposium should be viewed as a start of efforts to address the threat that ash clouds present to aviation safety . Volcanoes will certainly continue to erupt, and air traffic and aircraft sophistication will continue to grow.  To successfully coexist with the threat of volcanic ash, we must continue to address the volcanic hazard in a responsible fashion.  Open communications about these efforts are essential to successfully dealing with the volcanic hazard to aviation safety.

Rainier    Glaciers on Mt. Rainier    NPS Geology Fieldnotes on Mt. Rainier    USGS Mt. Rainier (Comprehensive!)                      HISTORY AND HAZARDS OF MOUNT RAINIER, WASHINGTON    Mount Rainier is an active volcano that first erupted about half a million years ago. Because of Rainier's great height (14,410 feet above sea level) and northerly location, glaciers have cut deeply into its lavas, making it appear deceptively older than it actually is. Mount Rainier is known to have erupted as recently as in the 1840's, and large eruptions took place as recently as about 1,000 and 2,300 years ago.    Mount Rainier and other similar volcanoes in the Cascade Range, such as Mount Adams and Mount Baker, erupt much less frequently than the more familiar Hawaiian volcanoes, but their eruptions are vastly more destructive. Hot lava and rock debris from Rainier's eruptions have melted snow and glacier ice and triggered debris flows (mudflows) - with a consistency of churning wet concrete - that have swept down all of the river valleys that head on the volcano. Debris flows have also formed by collapse of unstable parts of the volcano without accompanying eruptions. Some debris flows have traveled as far as the present margin of Puget Sound, and much of the lowland to the east of Tacoma and the south of Seattle is formed of prehistoric debris from Mount Rainier (Figure 1).    The northeast part of Mount Rainier slid away about 5,600 years ago as part of a catastrophic collapse similar to, but much larger than, that of May 18, 1980 at Mount St. Helens. Debris from this collapse created the Osceola and Paradise mudflows that traveled down the White and Nisqually Rivers, reaching Puget Sound and pushing out the shoreline by as much as several miles. The scar from this collapse was a horseshoe shaped crater, about 1.25 miles wide, open to the northeast. Since the collapse, lava flows and avalanches of hot lava fragments have erupted from the crater and largely filled it, forming the present summit cone of Mount Rainier.    Figure 1. Map showing areas inundated by mudflows (black)from Mount Rainier in the last 5,600 years.    Very little of this young lava can actually be seen, because it is almost completely concealed by snow and ice. The summit lava cone is most clearly recognized from the northeast (Sunrise), where it floors the large Emmons and Winthrop Glaciers that slope smoothly up to Rainier's summit (Figure 2). Broad lobes on the glaciers' surfaces show the locations of the youngest lavas from Rainier's summit, now buried under hundreds of feet of ice. The summit itself is formed of two small overlapping craters, each about a quarter mile in diameter; the younger of these forms a nearly perfect circle of radially outward-sloping lavas. The shallow floors of these craters are filled with snow and ice, but the raised rims are snow-free year-round because of high winds and because much of the ground is still hot. Steam or warm mist, at or just below boiling temperature, rises from the crater rims in many areas and has melted an intricate system of caves into the base of the crater-filling ice. On calm days, a faint odor of sulfur can also be smelled. The hot ground, steam, and sulfur smell, as well as the little eroded shape of the summit craters attest to Rainier's recent activity.    Volcanic rocks older than the summit cone form all but the highest slopes visible from other directions and can be recognized by their craggy appearance, caused by deep glacial erosion. The stair-step or banded look of these older rocks is caused by ice and landslides having cut into the lavas and exposed their dense interiors, that form cliffs, and their rubbly tops that form the intervening ledges, often covered with snow. Many of the lavas that make up upper Mount Rainier overlie, and are thus younger than, a lava that erupted 40,000 years ago (as measured by radiometric techniques), but are older than the 5,600-year-old collapse event. Many of these lavas were erupted during the last great ice age.    Lavas on Rainier's lower slopes formed flows to several hundred feet thick that now hold up most of the ridges radiating from Mount Rainier. Many of the measured eruption ages cluster in the interval l30,000 to 90,000 years ago, perhaps indicating a period of particularly voluminous volcanic activity.    There is nothing to suggest that volcanic activity has ended at Mount Rainier. Mount Rainier will surely erupt again, and this will affect people who live in the surrounding areas or who visit Mount Rainier National Park. Experience at other volcanoes indicates that renewed eruptions will likely be preceded by weeks or months of small earthquakes centered beneath the volcano. These earthquakes can be accompanied by swelling or other changes in the shape of the volcano, as well as changes in ground temperatures and the amount and type of gas released from the volcano. Earthquakes at Mount Rainier and other Cascade volcanoes are monitored by the University of Washington and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the volcanoes shapes are measured regularly the staff of the USGS's Cascades Volcano Observatory, located in Vancouver., Washington.    An eruption would probably begin with small steam blasts located at the summit, but could escalate in size and intensity, perhaps leading to a release of magma (hot, molten rock). Depending on the amount of magma released, the eruptions could have a relatively minor effect on the surrounding area or could produce large, destructive floods and debris flows, affecting areas far from the volcano. The shaking by earthquakes or explosions will also dislodge masses of unstable rock; the resulting rockslides could damage park facilities, particularly large landslides could also create destructive, far traveling debris, flows.    There is no immediate indication of renewed activity at Mount Rainier. However, the rapidly increasing population in the southern Puget Sound region, and the expansion of communities near Mount Rainier, has led to an increased overall risk to people and property once activity resumes. Scientists from universities and the government have responded by increasing the level of monitoring at Mount Rainier. New studies have been started aimed at learning the style and size of Rainier's past eruptions to predict better the nature of future activity, mapping the locations of particularly weak hydrothermally-altered rocks that would be more prone to collapse, and determining the structure of the rocks below the volcano so that any new swarms can be interpreted quickly and accurately.    The potential hazards posed by Mount Rainier led to its inclusions as one of sixteen volcanoes worldwide to be designated Decade Volcanoes. The Decade Volcano initiative is part of a United Nations program aimed at better utilizing science and emergency management to reduce the severity of natural disasters. The Decade Volcanoes are the focus of coordinated earth-science studies and land-use planning to learn the best ways to reduce the risks to life and property from volcano-related hazards. Products from Decade Volcano Studies at Mount Rainier will include updated maps showing the areas and levels of hazards, maps showing the locations and ages of Rainier's lavas and debris flow deposits, and report, on the style and size of selected eruptions and on the structure and makeup of the rocks forming Mount Rainier and its underpinnings.

GX031-00-5194287	"About the Lessons  |  Glossary  |  Bibliography    Volcanoes is an interdisciplinary set of materials for grades 4-8. Through the story of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, students will answer fundamental questions about  volcanoes : ""What is a volcano?"" ""Where do volcanoes occur and why?"" ""What are the effects of volcanoes on the Earth system?"" ""What are the risks and the benefits of living near volcanoes?"" ""Can scientists forecast volcanic eruptions?""     This teaching packet reflects the goals of the National Science Education Standards developed by the National Research Council. These standards recommend that middle school students be able to understand the Earth as a system. By learning about volcanoes, students will understand that the Earth comprises interacting components, or subsystems: the  geosphere  and the  biosphere . In turn the geosphere comprises the lithosphere, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the cryosphere. (fig. 1) These lessons show how the eruption of Mount St. Helens affected all of the Earth's subsystems.     Although volcanoes is an earth science subject, the activities in this packet incorporate a number of related subjects, including other sciences, social studies, language arts, and mathematics.    Contents of the online version of the VOLCANOES! teaching packet  include:        Information from the two-sided color poster      Teaching guide (with glossary and bibliography)       Six lesson plans with timed activities (activity sheets in PDF format)      Evaluation sheet      About the poster    The attractive VOLCANOES! poster is now for sale, call 1-888-ASK-USGS for more information. The poster is a key visual aid for many of the activities. Side 1 is a dramatic photograph of Mount St. Helens erupting on May 18, 1980. Side 2 is a series of photographs and illustrations annotated with text written for student readers. The section titled ""Volcanoes"" is a basic introduction to volcanoes and volcanic eruptions. The section titled ""Mount St. Helens"" tells the story of the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens and the effect the eruption had on each of the components of the Earth system. All poster information is available, where appropriate, on this online edition of VOLCANOES!.     Each photograph and diagram has a number. When lessons refer to specific photographs and illustrations, they are referenced as "" poster fig. "" followed by the number of the photograph or diagram.    |  Top  |  Teaching Guide table of contents  |   Back to VOLCANOES! home        About the lessons    Each lesson includes:         Illustrated background information      Two step-by-step, timed activities       Reproducible Master Sheets for making overhead transparencies or photocopies (in PDF format)      Reproducible Activity Sheets for your students      There are six lessons. Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 should be taught in sequence. Lesson 6 is probably best suited as a wrap-up. Many of the activities are demonstrations that will help students, particularly elementary-level students, visualize the physical, chemical, geologic, and biologic processes being presented.     The Master Sheets and some Activity Sheets are in PDF format. PDF format reproduces the look of the printed publication and will be better for creating overlay and overhead transparencies. To view and print the PDF version, you must obtain and install the   Acrobat® Reader,  available at no charge from Adobe Systems.    Lesson 1: Windows into the Earth    The  lithosphere  is the Earth's hard, outermost shell that is divided into a mosaic of 16 major slabs, or plates.      The first lesson introduces the nature of volcanoes and volcanic eruptions. In addressing how and where volcanoes occur, students learn that volcanic eruptions are geologic events that take place within the upper part and on the surface of the Earth's lithosphere.    Volcanic eruptions, however, can impact all of the Earth's systems, including the lithosphere itself: Volcanic eruptions create volcanic mountains. A key point is that understanding how and where volcanoes occur helps students understand the dynamic nature of the Earth's geologic processes.     Lesson 2: Creators and Destroyers    This lesson continues to explain how volcanoes are related to the Earth's  lithosphere . With a basic understanding of how volcanoes erupt, students focus on the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens. They see how changes to the volcano's shape in the month prior to the eruption reflected changes that were taking place inside of the volcano. They also learn that volcanic eruptions can destroy the landforms they help create. The May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens is a dramatic example of both creation and destruction.    Lesson 3: Up in the Air    The  atmosphere  is the mixture of gases that envelops the Earth.    This lesson explains how volcanoes can affect the atmosphere. Students learn that volcanic eruptions affect places ten to thousands of miles from an eruption site because of the ejection of volcanic rock fragments, gases, and  aerosols  into the atmosphere. They also discover that volcanoes do not have to erupt to have an effect on the atmosphere. The presence of volcanic mountains, such as the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest, continually affect atmospheric conditions, and hence the climate, of the region.    Lesson 4: Fire, Water, and Ice    The  hydrosphere  and  cryosphere  are the subsystems that contain the Earth's water. The hydrosphere is the water on the Earth's surface contained in oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams, as well as ground water that circulates within the upper part of the lithosphere. The cryosphere is water on the Earth's surface in its frozen state, such as  glaciers ; snow; sea, lake, and river ice; and  permafrost  (permanently frozen ground).     This lesson explains how water from the hydrosphere and cryosphere can combine with volcanic materials from the lithosphere to produce catastrophic  mudflows  and floods. Students see the relationship between where mudflows and floods are likely to occur and a volcano's topography. They also discover why snow and ice cap many volcanic mountains and that the potential melting of ice and snow adds to the volcanic hazards on these mountains.   Lesson 5: Death and Recovery    The  biosphere  is the realm of all living things, including humans.      This lesson addresses the effect volcanic eruptions can have on the biosphere—the realm of all living things. Students learn that while the eruption of Mount St. Helens claimed about 60 human lives, the toll on wildlife and plants was incalculable. By interpreting a set of  tree rings , students discover that a volcanic eruption can have positive as well as negative effects on plant growth. Finally, students examine the role that eyewitness accounts played in helping scientists reconstruct the events of the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens, reinforcing the importance of first-hand observation as a scientific tool of investigation.    Lesson 6: Living with Volcanoes     The final lesson addresses the fact that volcanic eruptions can occur in populated areas. Students discover that people who have lived with volcanoes have attempted to understand the volcano's presence and behavior—using legends and folklore for most of human history. Students see how, today, scientists reconstruct the history of a volcano's eruptions to understand the potential hazards of future eruptions. Students conclude the lesson by creating materials that they could use to explain volcanoes and their hazards to a community living near an active volcano.   A word about map skills    Many of the activities included in these lessons require basic map skills. Students should know how to read simple maps, such as road maps. They also need to understand the following concepts:         Basic compass directions (north, south, east, and west)      Using a map scale to determine distance between two points      Using a map legend, or key, to interpret basic map symbols      Locating places on the basis of longitude and latitude      The U.S. Geological Survey's teaching packet    What Do Maps Show?  is an excellent introduction to map reading for upper elementary and junior high school students. You may want to review it before teaching the topographic map skills used in Lessons 2, 4, and 6.

Aerosol : Fine liquid or solid particles suspended in the atmosphere. Aerosols resulting from volcanic eruptions are tiny droplets of sulfuric acid—sulfur dioxide that has picked up oxygen and water.     Ash : Fragments less than 2 millimeters (about 1/8 inch) in diameter of lava or rock blasted into the air by volcanic explosions.    Atmosphere : The mixture of gases, aerosols, solid particles, and water vapor that envelops the Earth.    Biosphere : The realm of all living things.     Crater : The circular depression containing a volcanic vent.    Cinder cone : A steep-sided volcano formed by the explosive eruption of cinders that form around a vent. Cinders are lava fragments about 1 centimeter (about  inch) in diameter.    Crust : The Earth's outermost layer.    Contour lines : Parallel lines used on topographic maps to show the shape and elevation of the land. They connect points of equal elevation.    Cryosphere : The ice and snow on the Earth's surface, such as glaciers; sea, lake, and river ice; snow; and permafrost.     Dome : A steep-sided mound that forms when very viscous lava is extruded from a volcanic vent.     Dormant volcano : An active volcano that is in repose (quiescence) but is expected to erupt in the future.    Extinct volcano : A volcano that is not expected to erupt again.     Geosphere : The nonliving parts of the Earth: the lithosphere, the atmosphere, the cryosphere, and the hydrosphere.    Glacier : A thick mass of ice resulting from compacted snow that forms when more snow accumulates than melts annually.     Harmonic tremor : Continuous rhythmic earthquakes in the Earth's upper lithosphere that can be detected by seismographs. Harmonic tremors often precede or accompany volcanic eruptions.    Hot spot : An area in the middle of a lithospheric plate where magma rises from the mantle and erupts at the Earth's surface. Volcanoes sometimes occur above a hot spot.    Hydrosphere : The water that covers 71 percent of the Earth's surface as oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams. The hydrosphere also includes ground water, water that circulates below the Earth's surface in the upper part of the lithosphere.     Lateral blast : A sideways-directed explosion from the side or summit of a volcano.    Lava : The term used for magma once it has erupted onto the Earth's surface.    Leeward : The side of a land mass sheltered from the wind—the opposite of windward.     Lithosphere : The Earth's hard, outermost shell. It comprises the crust and the upper part of the mantle and is divided into a mosaic of 16 major slabs, or plates.     Lithospheric plates : A series of rigid slabs (16 major ones at present) that make up the Earth's outer shell. These plates float on top of a softer, more plastic layer in the Earth's mantle. (Also called tectonic plates.)    Magma : Molten rock containing liquids, crystals, and dissolved gases that forms within the upper part of the Earth's mantle and crust. When erupted onto the Earth's surface, it is called lava.     Mantle : A zone in the Earth's interior between the crust and the core that is 2,900 kilometers (1,740 miles) thick. (The lithosphere is composed of the topmost 65-70 kilometers (39-42 miles) of the mantle and the crust.)     Mudflow : A flowing mixture of water and debris (intermediate between a volcanic avalanche and a water flood) that forms on the slopes of a volcano. Sometimes called a debris flow or lahar, a term from Indonesia where volcanic mudflows are a major hazard.    Permafrost : Permanently frozen ground at high latitude and high elevation.    Prevailing winds : The direction from which winds most frequently blow at a specific geographic location.    Seismograph : A scientific instrument that detects and records vibrations (seismic waves) produced by earthquakes.     Shield volcano : A volcano that resembles an inverted warrior's shield. It has long gentle slopes produced by multiple eruptions of fluid lava flows.    Snowline : The lowest elevation at which snow remains from year to year and does not melt during the summer.     Spreading ridges : Places on the ocean floor where lithospheric plates separate and magma erupts. About 80 percent of the Earth's volcanic activity occurs on the ocean floor.     Stratovolcano : A steep-sided volcano built by lava flows and tephra deposits. (Also called composite volcano.)    Subduction zone : The place where two lithospheric plates come together, one riding over the other. Most volcanoes on land occur parallel to and inland from the boundary between the two plates.    Tephra : Solid material of all sizes explosively ejected from a volcano into the atmosphere.     Topographic map : A map that uses contour lines to represent the three-dimensional features of a landscape on a two-dimensional surface.    Tree rings : Concentric rings formed annually as a tree grows.     Vent : The opening at the Earth's surface through which volcanic materials (lava, tephra, and gases) erupt. Vents can be at a volcano's summit or on its slopes; they can be circular (craters) or linear (fissures).    Viscosity : Measure of the fluidity of a substance. Taffy and molasses are very viscous; water has low viscosity.    Volcano : A vent (opening) in the Earth's surface through which magma erupts; it is also the landform that is constructed by the eruptive material.    Volcanic avalanche : A large, chaotic mass of soil, rock, and volcanic debris moving swiftly down the slopes of a volcano. Volcanic avalanches can also occur without an eruption as a result of an earthquake; heavy rainfall; or unstable soil, rock, and volcanic debris. (Also called debris avalanche.)    Windward : The side of a land mass facing the direction from which the wind is blowing—the opposite of leeward.    |  Top  |  Teaching Guide table of contents  |  Back to VOLCANOES! home        Bibliography   Print Publications    *indicates juvenile books    Brantley, S.R.

GX030-98-3633650	"United States Has Many Active Volcanoes  |  Forecasting Future Eruptions Benefits Often Overlooked  |   Activity 1  |  Activity 2       Relative to other types of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and tornados, volcanic eruptions occur infrequently. Of the 1,500 active volcanoes on land, approximately 50-60 erupt each year. Approximately 1 million people have been killed by volcanic eruptions during the past 2,000 year.    United States Has Many Active Volcanoes     Because many of the most hazardous volcanoes have not erupted during recent historic times, people erroneously consider them extinct. For Mount St. Helens, more than a century had elapsed since a major eruption; most people were not aware of its dangers. Mount St. Helens is one of more than 65 active or potentially active volcanoes in the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. Only Indonesia and Japan have more!    Scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey continue to monitor Mount St. Helens and other volcanoes in the Cascade Range. They know from its past eruptive history that many of Mount St. Helens' eruptions have occurred in concentrated periods of time lasting decades or even centuries. For example, one eruptive phase began in 1480 and lasted for about 300 years. Based on that history, scientists anticipate that Mount St. Helens will continue to erupt episodically for decades to come before it returns to a dormant stage.     The eruption of Mount St. Helens served as a reminder that other dormant volcanoes can come to life again. Mount Shasta in Northern California, for example, probably last erupted in 1786. On a geological time scale, this very recent volcanic activity suggests that magma is still present beneath the volcano. On average, it has erupted once every 300 years over the past 3,500 years. The chance is 1 in 25 to 30 that it will erupt in any one decade and 1 in 3 or 4 within a person's lifetime.        Forecasting Future Eruptions   Scientists have improved their ability to predict the time of a volcanic eruption, but estimating the size and style of an eruption remains a difficult challenge. Despite this challenge, scientists try to assess the potential consequences of a future eruption by reconstructing a volcano's history, which includes the pattern, magnitude, and frequency of its past eruptions. The principal means of developing this history is by mapping and dating the different types of volcanic materials that have been deposited by previous eruptions. Assembled into volcanic hazards maps, this information is vital for communities in volcanically active areas to use for land use and emergency preparedness planning. Knowing a volcano's past is crucial to forecasting its future behavior.    Benefits Often Overlooked    Because of the destructive nature of a volcanic eruption, we tend to overlook a volcano's benefits. Magma circulates and deposits many valuable elements, such as gold, silver, zinc, sulfur, and copper. Magma heats ground water systems that can be tapped to produce geothermal power. This heated ground water can also result in geysers and hot springs. Volcanoes are also responsible for some of the world's most fertile soils. And volcanoes continuously bring materials from inside the Earth to the surface—recycling on a grand scale.    |  Top  |  Lesson 6 table of contents  |   Back to VOLCANOES! home  |         Activity 1  Creating a Legend     45 minutes   Students create a legend that explains the existence of Mount St. Helens.    Key teaching points         Mount St. Helens has been a fact of life for people living in its shadow ever since humans began populating the Pacific Northwest more than 10,000 years ago. There have been dozens of eruptions during the past 4,500 years.       Before there were scientific explanations for why volcanoes erupted, people developed stories to explain the presence and behavior of volcanoes.      The Yakima Indians called the volcano ""Tah-one-lat-clah"" (Fire Mountain). The  Cowlitzpeople called it ""Lawetlatla"" (Person from Whom Smoke Comes). Its modern name,  Mount St. Helens, was given to the volcano in 1792 by Captain George Vancouver of the British Royal Navy.      Materials   None required.    Procedures         Tell the legend below that was created by the Yakima people. (Before European settlement in the 19th century, the Yakima people had considerable territory on the Yakima and Columbia Rivers in Eastern Washington. Today, descendants of these people live on the Yakima Indian Reservation in south-central Washington.)    Two tribes lived across the river from one another. Because they were friendly and peaceful tribes, the Great Spirit built a bridge across the river for them. Eventually, however, the tribes began to quarrel. The Great Spirit became angry. To punish the tribes he took away fire. The tribes prayed to the Great Spirit to return fire to them. Finally, the Great Spirit agreed. To restore fire, the Great Spirit had to go to an old woman named Loo-Wit who, because of her goodness, still had fire. Loo-Wit promised the Great Spirit that she would share her fire with the two tribes if the Great Spirit would make her eternally young and beautiful. Fire was restored, and the tribes were peaceful for a short time. The chiefs of both of the tribes, however, fell in love with the beautiful Loo-Wit. The chiefs began to quarrel and went to war. Once again, the Great Spirit became angry and in retaliation he turned the two chiefs into mountains. One became Mount Hood and one became Mount Adams. Because Loo-Wit was so beautiful, the Great Spirit made her into Mount St. Helen—that way she could remain beautiful forever.       Students discuss how the legend differs from the way we now explain how volcanoes form. Are there similarities between the legend and scientific explanations?       Ask students to imagine that they live in a time and place where there are no scientific explanations for why there is an active volcano near their community. Students create and present orally a short legend to explain why the volcano exists or erupts.      Extension    Do research from the journals of George Vancouver, John Fremont, and other explorers to thePacific Northwest to learn their descriptions of Mount St. Helens and other volcanoes in the Cascade Range. Using these accounts as a basis, students create their own diary entries.    |  Top  |  Lesson 6 table of contents  |   Back to VOLCANOES! home  |          Activity 2  There's a Volcano in my Backyard!     45-minute work session one followup project    Using a volcanic hazard map of Mount Rainier, students reach conclusions about the potential hazards of future eruptions. They then create educational materials about these hazards.     Key teaching points         Mount Rainier is located 35 kilometers (21 miles) southeast of the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area—an area that has a population of 2.5 million.       Mount Rainier is an active volcano whose last major eruption was approximately 150 years ago.        Mount Rainier has five times as much snow and glacier ice as all the other Cascades volcanoes combined. Mudflows are the most dangerous hazard.       Throughout the volcano's history, there have been numerous mudflows. Today, parts of Tacoma, Wash., and many other smaller communities have been built on top of these old flows—evidence that they lie within the reach of future mudflows that could originate from an eruption of Mount Rainier.       An eruption of Mount Rainier could kill hundreds of thousands of people and cripple the region's economy.      Materials    Activity Sheet  6.2  (in PDF)    Procedures   Work Session         Review with students  that Mount St. Helens is one of a number of active volcanoes in the Cascade Range. Some others include: Mount Baker, Mount Rainier, and Mount Adams in Washington; Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and Crater Lake in Oregon; and Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak in California.       On a large map,  locate Mount Rainier and locate cities within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of  it.       As a class,  list the major eruptive events (include avalanches, mudflows, and tephra falls) that occurred during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.       Using an overhead projector,  show students the eruptive history map of Mount Rainier (see Activity Sheet 6.2). Explain that scientists study past eruptions to help them forecast future eruptions. Looking at this map, what type of eruptive events have occurred in the past .       Distribute Activity Sheet 6.2.  Tell students they will look at Mount Rainier's history of volcanic mudflows and forecast if there are any cities that would be at risk during a future eruption.       Discuss:  What cities, if any, would be at risk if there were a future eruption? Is it possible, or practical, to eliminate all risks to these cities? What things can be done to reduce risks to life and property? Conclude that public education is a major activity.    Followup Project    Students work individually or in teams to develop a range of educational materials and programs for the general public, especially school children. These might include posters; displays for schools, public libraries, and community centers; brochures; public service announcements on TV and radio; and information on the Internet.

GX030-94-2329842	"Day Becomes Night  |  Volcanic Ash's Deadly Effects     Impact on Climate  |  How Much Ash Fell?      Activity 1  |  Activity 2        The volume of ash ejected during an eruption is one factor in measuring the size of an eruption. Note that the May 18 volume was  less than several earlier eruptions of Mount St. Helens and considerably less than eruptions of other volcanoes.    In less than 10 minutes after the onset of the cataclysmic eruption of Mount St. Helens, a column of  tephra , steam,  aerosols , and gases reached an altitude of 19 kilometers (12 miles). Although the largest fragments of tephra fell back to the ground close to the volcano, the smallest fragments, ash and dust, were carried eastward by the  prevailing winds . Five days after the eruption, monitoring instruments in New England detected ash from Mount St. Helens. Some of the ash eventually circled the globe and the smallest fragments and aerosols remained suspended for years in the  stratosphere .     Day Becomes Night    Moving at an average speed of 95 kilometers per hour (60 miles per hour), the ash cloud reached Yakima, Wash., by 9:45 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time and Spokane, Wash., about 2 hours later. In Yakima, a city of 51,000, day became night. Automobile and street lights remained on for the rest of the day as the eruption continued for more than 9 hours. Ash as fine as talcum powder clogged engine air filters and choked people - face masks or handkerchiefs were a necessity for those who ventured out of doors.     Ash blanketed the ground like snow, but snow that would not melt. Residents shoveled and bulldozed ash from streets, sidewalks, and roofs; an estimated 600,000 tons of ash were removed from the city. It took 10 weeks to haul it away!    Volcanic Ash's Deadly Effects      Ash fall, however, is more than an inconvenience. It can be lethal to plants, wildlife, and humans. Swirling particles of ash in the atmosphere generated lightning, which in turn ignited hundreds of forest fires near the volcano. Autopsies revealed that most of the human deaths in the blast area resulted from asphyxiation, from inhaling hot volcanic ash during the first few minutes of the eruption.     As the ash settled to the ground, it also took its toll. Eastern Washington became known as the ""ash belt"" where many farm crops were destroyed in areas of thick accumulation. Volcanic ash can also affect aircraft operations. Jet engines are susceptible to damage: the volcanic ash coats and melts turbine blades, often causing the engines to stall.    |  Top  |  Lesson 3 table of contents  |  Back to VOLCANOES! home |     Impact on Climate      Volcanic eruptions can also affect climate and weather patterns. Mount St. Helens' 1980 eruptions did not have a significant effect on global climate, but the 1982 eruption of El Chichòn in Mexico, for example, had measurable effects. El Chichòn's magma was much richer in sulfur than Mount St. Helens'. As a result, the Mexican volcano produced sulfuric acid aerosols (a fine mist of particles) that formed a layer of haze in the stratosphere. This haze, which can remain in the atmosphere for years, reflects the sun's radiation and reduces surface temperatures. For example, more than a year after the April 1815 eruption of Indonesia's Tambora volcano, its effects were felt. In the northeastern United States, 1816 was so cold that snow fell in some New England States in June and July. It was known in New England as the ""year without a summer.""    How Much Ash Fell?    In comparison to other historic eruptions, the volume of ash fall from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was relatively small (fig. 1). The eruption of Tambora ejected 150 times more ash than Mount St. Helens in 1980. And ash ejected by Mount Mazama (now Crater Lake), located about 125 kilometers (200 miles) south of Mount St. Helens, was even greater than Tambora. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was only an inkling of the destructive potential of a volcanic eruption.     |  Top  |  Lesson 3 table of contents  |  Back to VOLCANOES! home |            Activity 1  Tracking an Ash Cloud    15-minute demonstration   45-minute work session  Students observe a  demonstration  of a ""dust box"" to help them understand that some volcanic ash (tephra) may be difficult to see. In a  work session,  they will then use the equation, D = RxT (distance is equal to the rate of speed times the time of travel) to calculate the time it took volcanic ash erupted into the atmosphere to travel to different parts of the United States following the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens.     Key teaching points         Explosive volcanoes can erupt large quantities of tephra, gases, and aerosols into the atmosphere.        The smallest of these particles are suspended in the atmosphere and are sometimes carried by wind great distances from the immediate site of an eruption. Some of these particles are too small to see.

Line the interior of the box with black construction paper or a dark sheet, or spray paint it black.    On one side, cut a hole the same size as the lamp end of the flashlight.        Introduction    Use  the photograph on the  VOLCANOES! teacher packet table of contents  (side 1 of the poster)  and point out the column of  ash  rising above Mount St. Helens. Remind students that in Lesson 1 they learned that explosive volcanoes like Mount St. Helens erupt rock and lava fragments, gases, and aerosols into the atmosphere. The rock fragments, which are called tephra, can range in size from car-sized boulders to ash or dust that is so small it is invisible to the naked eye.    Demonstration          With the lights on, beat two erasers together inside of the ""dust box.""        Ask students to raise their hands when they can no longer see any ""dust"" in the air. When the last student has raised his or her hand, turn on the flashlight. Ask students to put their hands down if they now see dust.       Work Session          Discuss the photographs and captions in the atmosphere section of the poster  ( poster figs.12—14 .) . Remind students of the ""dust box"" demonstration. Like chalk dust, the smallest volcanic particles stay suspended in the atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, they can be carried by wind great distances from the volcano. ( fig. 2 )         Some of these particles are so small that they form invisible clouds, which are particularly dangerous to airplanes that unknowingly encounter volcanic ash clouds. Volcanic ash sucked into jet engines can cause the engines to stall, as the following story illustrates:          Following the 1989 eruption of Mount Redoubt in Alaska, a Boeing 747 aircraft lost power in all four of its engines after flying into a volcanic ash cloud. Finally after losing 4,267 meters (14,000 feet) in altitude the pilot was able to restart the engines. The airliner landed safely, but the damage to the aircraft has been estimated to exceed $80 million. Because of the potential hazard posed by ash clouds to aircraft, air traffic controllers need to issue warnings to aircraft flying in the air space they monitor.         Tell the students that they are air traffic controllers. They have just received word that Mount St. Helens has had a major eruption. They should stand by to receive critical data so that they can calculate when airborne ash will reach the air space they monitor. Discuss with the class the type of data they will need to gather, such as        the time of the eruption,      the wind direction,      the rate of speed the airborne tephra is traveling, and      how far their city is located from the eruption.        Divide the class into teams of air traffic controllers for each of the following locations:        Great Falls, Mont.     Rapid City, S. Dak.      Madison, Wis.      Minneapolis, Minn.     Chicago, Ill.     Detroit, Mich.     Pittsburgh, Pa.     Boston, Mass.        On their activity sheet, each team will use the data to calculate the time the ash is expected to arrive in the air space they monitor. (The ash cloud is moving at a rate of 96 kilometers per hour.)      Distribute the Activity Sheets.     Before students begin, review with the class the formula (D=RxT). Demonstrate how to use the formula to calculate both rate and time.         As a homework assignment, ask each student to calculate the time it took the ash cloud to circle the Earth. The Earth is 40,000 kilometers (20,500 miles) at the Equator.

Key Teaching Points          The Cascade Range comprises a 1,130-kilometers (about 700 miles) long chain of volcanoes lying about 160 to 240 kilometers (100 to 150 miles) inland from the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Their location affects the climate of the Pacific Northwest region.       Because the Cascades act as a geographic barrier to moisture-laden masses of air arriving from the Pacific Ocean, cities on the west side of the mountain receive more precipitation annually than those on the east side. The cities on the east side are in the ""rain shadow"" created by the mountains.       Materials         Activity Sheets 3.2  a — b      Wall map of the United States      Glass of ice water         Procedures        Using a large wall map, locate the Cascade Range. Remind students that Mount St. Helens is one of the volcanic mountains that make up the Cascade Range.        Tell students that in the Pacific Northwest region, the  prevailing winds  blow from west to east. That means that most of the weather that affects the region forms over the Pacific Ocean where it picks up a great deal of moisture. Given this fact, ask students if they think annual precipitation is greater or lesser on the west or east side of the mountains.       Distribute Activity Sheets 3.2 a-b.        After the students have completed their activity sheets, discuss with them the reasons why cities on the west side of the Cascade Range have a greater precipitation than those on the east side of the mountains.          The mountains act as a barrier: Air must rise to get over the mountains. As the air rises, the temperature of the air falls and moisture in the air condenses. As the moisture condenses, it falls as rain or snow. By the time the air reaches the top of the mountain, most of the moisture has been lost as rain or snow.     As the air descends on the other side of the mountain, most of the moisture that remains is lost through evaporation instead of falling as precipitation.     That is why cities on the western, or  windward , side of the Cascades receive a higher annual precipitation than those on the eastern, or   leeward , side of the Cascades. The mountains have produced a ""rain shadow"" on the leeward side (fig. 4).         Extension    Have students prepare reports discussing how the differences in precipitation in the Pacific Northwest affect the natural resources and economy of the region.

GX028-51-7031655	"M ount St. Helens towers above the chaotic landslide deposit that fills a former valley to a depth of as much as 195 meters. Note many small hills atop the landslide, called""hummocks"" by geologists. (Photograph by Lyn Topinka.)   The well-documented landslide at Mount St. Helens has helped geologists to recognize more than 200 similar deposits at other volcanoes in the world, including several other Cascade peaks. Geologists now realize that large landslides from volcanoes are far more common than previously thought--seventeen such volcanic landslides have occurred worldwide in the past 400 years. Consequently, when scientists evaluate the types of volcanic activity that may endanger people, giant landslides are now included, in addition to other types of volcanic activity such as lava flows, pyroclastic flows, lahars, and falling ash.    Following the 1980 explosive eruption, more than a dozen extrusions of thick, pasty lava built a mound-shaped lava dome in the new crater. The dome is about 1,100 meters in diameter and 250 meters tall.     <http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volcus/page22.html>  Maintained by  John Watson  Updated 06.24.97"
GX018-65-15316834	"U.S. Geological Survey       Public Affairs Office Pat Jorgenson   (415) 329-4000 For Release: UPON RECEIPT (Faxed Feb. 1, 1997) Hazards From Erupting Volcanoes Can Be Reduced, According to U.S. Geological Survey Scientists    Keeping ""volcano mania"" in perspective -- Science Feature        Movie buffs, who will be bombarded by a series of big-screen and ""made for TV"" movies about volcanoes during the next few months, may wonder what is being done to reduce the risk of a real-world disaster the next time an eruption threatens local communities or the skies above.     ""Plenty,"" say USGS volcanologists who have worked at some of the world's most dangerous volcanoes.  ""Volcanic eruptions have tremendous potential for destruction, but we are learning how to reduce the risk through research, planning, and public education,"" said Robert Tilling, chief of the USGS Volcano Hazards Team in Menlo Park, Calif.  Starting at Mount St. Helens in 1980 and continuing to the present day, USGS scientists have responded to dozens of volcano crises in the United States and elsewhere. By assessing hazards from future eruptions based on a volcano's past behavior, carefully monitoring for signs of restlessness, and keeping public officials informed of the dangers, scientists have helped to save thousands of lives and millions of dollars worth of property throughout the world.     ""Enjoy the movies,"" Tilling said, ""but remember that natural processes like volcanic eruptions only turn into natural disasters when humans get in the way.  We can live in harmony with our active volcanoes, but only if we respect their power and plan accordingly.""     ""Not all hazards from eruptions are limited to the immediate vicinity of the volcano,"" said Dan Dzurisin, scientist-in-charge at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in Vancouver, Wash.  ""Huge debris avalanches and associated volcanic mudflows, such as those at Mount St. Helens in 1980, can travel tens of miles down valleys surrounding a volcano.  In some cases, it may be safer to be closer to an erupting volcano and on high ground than it is to be farther away and on the floor of a valley.""     Even more far-reaching than avalanches and mudflows are plumes of volcanic ash, shot high into the atmosphere, that could damage or even bring down an airliner hundreds of miles from an erupting volcano.  This has become a serious problem in recent years as air traffic through some of the world's worst ""volcano shooting galleries"" has increased dramatically.  ""A prime example is our own Aleutian volcanic chain in Alaska,"" said Terry Keith, scientist-in-charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), a facility jointly operated by the USGS, Fairbanks Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska, and Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys.  Every day, dozens of planes fly over or near some of the Aleutian's most active volcanoes.  In 1989, a Boeing 747-400 aircraft descended into what appeared to be a thin haze layer while on approach to Anchorage International Airport.  In fact, the ""haze"" was volcanic ash from a small eruption of nearby Redoubt volcano.  The jumbo jet lost power from all four engines for several agonizing minutes before the crew was able to restart them and land safely.  Although no one was injured, damage to the plane was approximately $80 million.  To avoid such costly and potentially deadly encounters in the future, the USGS, Federal Aviation Administration, and National Weather Service are working with similar agencies around the world to provide timely warnings of dangerous ash plumes.  ""Last year, we installed monitoring equipment on four additional volcanoes in the Aleutians, and this year we'll start monitoring four more,"" said Keith.     Hazards from an erupting volcano can take many forms, including blasts, debris avalanches and debris flows, pyroclastic flows, lava flows, ashfall and poisonous gases.  ""By studying a volcano's eruptive history, we can get a pretty good idea of which hazards pose the greatest risks,"" according to USGS researcher Kevin Scott.  ""At Mount Rainier, for example, we know that debris flows have repeatedly buried all of the valleys surrounding the volcano during the past few thousand years, and they will continue to do so in the future.""  In recent years, USGS scientists have focused their attention on the volcano's history of debris flows and on mapping its ice-covered cone.  Scott noted that an important difference between the last giant debris flow that swept down Mount Rainier's western slopes about 500 years ago and the one that could happen in the near future is the large number of people who now would be at risk.     Some of the most dramatic scenes of volcanic eruptions and those that most often come to the minds of Americans are the spurting lava fountains  and red-hot lava streams of Hawaii.  Although they are spectacular and destroy everything in their path,  few lives are lost to these types of eruptions, because there is usually time for people to safely evacuate when threatened by an advancing flow.  On the Island of Hawaii, in fact, where Kilauea volcano has been erupting almost continuously since 1983, the eruption has destroyed more than 185 residences and other structures for a loss of $ 61 million, yet only one person has lost his life.  ""Deadly explosive eruptions can occur in Hawaii, but they are infrequent, said Don Swanson, scientist-in-charge at the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO).  ""We take advantage of the volcano's frequent but usually safe eruptions to learn as much as we can about how volcanoes work, so we can apply what we learn to other, less friendly and less-cooperative volcanoes.  But we also have some unique volcano-related health hazards to deal with here.  Lava flowing into the ocean triggers a chemical reaction that produces a noxious brew known as ""vog"" or volcanic smog.  Medical researchers have documented deleterious human health effects of exposure to vog and other volcanic gas, and we volcanologists have recognized the need to work with chemists and meteorologists to better understand the phenomenon.""     USGS volcanologists also are keeping a close eye on other potentially active volcanic systems, including Yellowstone caldera in Wyoming and the Long Valley-Inyo-Mono volcanic chain at the base of the Sierra Nevada of eastern California.  Just one week after the devastating eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, the Long Valley area was rocked by four magnitude-6 earthquakes within 48 hours and thousands of smaller ones over the next several weeks.  Since then, Long Valley has been one of the more restless volcanic systems in the world.  David Hill, USGS scientist-in-charge for Long Valley, explained,  ""Since 1980, an area near the town of Mammoth Lakes has experienced thousands of small earthquakes, uplift of the ground by as much as two feet, and increased fumarolic activity.""  A swarm of earthquakes beneath Mammoth Mountain in 1989 accompanied an intrusion of magma beneath the volcano that failed to make it to the surface, but got close enough for carbon dioxide gas released from the magma to kill trees in the area.     So, with all the media hype focused on erupting volcanoes, what are the odds that an eruption will occur anytime soon?  In Hawaii, there's no clear end in sight to the eruption that started in 1983-it might continue for years or even decades.     The remote volcanoes of the Aleutian chain in Alaska typically produce two or more eruptions every year, posing a significant threat to aviation safety.     The Cascade volcanoes of Washington, Oregon, and northern California produce an average of one to two eruptions per century, but here the risk is larger owing to the greater population density.     For most of the volcanoes in the conterminous western United States, we've identified the areas likely to be threatened by future eruptions on hazard-zonation maps, which provide a basis for long-range planning.  The best way to minimize the effects of an eruption, after all, is to incorporate hazards information in land-use planning to avoid high-density development in hazardous volcanic areas.     The USGS volcanologists' best advice is to enjoy the season's volcano movies for their entertainment value, but keep in mind that real eruptions are serious business.  By staying informed, you can significantly reduce your risk from future eruptions.  If you think your community could be threatened by a volcanic eruption, contact the USGS to determine if you are within a volcano hazard zone, learn more about volcano hazards from some of the sources listed below, find out what emergency plans have been made by your community, and develop a contingency plan for you and your family.     * * * USGS * * *      (Editors:  Interviews with volcanologists can be arranged by calling the USGS Public Affairs Office at 415-329-4000, or by calling the following volcanologists directly:     USGS Volcano Hazards Program:     Robert I.
