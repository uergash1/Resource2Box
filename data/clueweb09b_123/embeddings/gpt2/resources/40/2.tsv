Thomas and James are both upset; Philip appears to want an explanation. On the far right of the painting is the final group of three: Matthew, Jude Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot. They are engaged in conversation amongst themselves, as if Matthew and Jude are hoping to get some sort of explanation from Simon.   As our eyes move across the painting, shifting from one apostle's reaction to the next, one thing which may become evident is how human the depiction of each figure is. There are no halos or any other marker of holiness - not even any symbols of divinity around Jesus himself. Every person is a human being, reacting in a human way. It is thus the human aspect of the moment which Leonardo Da Vinci was trying to capture and express, not the sacred or divine aspects usually focused on in Christian liturgy.

Thus the reactions of all the disciples are the reactions to hearing that one of them is a traitor to Jesus who would cause the death of their teacher. Each reacts in a different way.   On the far left of the painting are grouped Bartholomew, James the Lesser and Andrew, with Andrew throwing up his hand as if to say ""stop!"" The fact that he is to be betrayed by someone who is eating with him at that time heightens the enormity of the act - in the ancient world, people who break bread together were assumed to have established a bond with each other, one not lightly broken.   The vindictiveness with which Jesus describes the betrayer is, however, very strange. Jesus makes it clear that he knows that the events he is experiencing are predetermined by God: he, the Son of man, goes where it is ""written"" that he must. Isn't the same true of Judas? Doesn't he ""goeth, as it is written of him""? If so, then it's unreasonable for him to be punished so harshly that he would wish that he ""had never been born."" Only an evil deity would punish a person for acting in exactly the way that the deity desired.   Also curious are the reactions of Jesus' disciples: instead of asking who the betrayer would be, each asks in turn if he will be the betrayer. Most normal people wouldn't wonder if they will end up betraying their teacher. Asking this question indicates that they, too, recognize that they are playing roles in some grand drama where the beginning, middle, and end of the script have already been written by God.

For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, ""This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."" In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, ""This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."" For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of the ceremony directly from the Lord, that is to say, by  revelation .

Location       Main article:  Cenacle       According to tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).

Many separate, but related religious groups of that era shared similar mystic, eschatological, messianic, and ascetic beliefs. ...     Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room that the Last Supper was held in and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.       Bread and wine              The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       In the course of the Last Supper, according to  Paul  and the  Synoptic Gospels  (but not the  Gospel of John ), Jesus divides up some bread, says a prayer (see also  grace ), and hands the pieces to his disciples, saying  this is my body . He then takes a cup of  wine , (known as the  Holy Grail ), offers another prayer, and hands it around, saying  this is my blood of the everlasting 'covenant', which is poured for many  . Finally, according to Paul and Luke, he tells the disciples  do this in memory of me . These words signify the whole point in the final meal. Jesus wants the disciples to remember him, and his ways even in death, because he knows that they will again be reunited in the kingdom of God.

During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official Passover dinner, and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626), although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.

This institute has been regarded by Christians of different denominations as the first  Eucharist  or  Holy Communion . Jesus' behaviour may be derived from a passage in the  Book of Isaiah , where  Isaiah 53:12  refers to a blood sacrifice that  Moses  is described in  Exodus  as having made in order to seal a covenant with God  Exodus 24:8 . Scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' behaviour as him asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).

According to the Canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be Judas. Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man !

It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where  Judas Iscariot  is specifically singled out. This is the very moment poignantly portrayed in  Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper .   The Gospel of Matthew (literally, according to Matthew; Greek, ÎšÎ±Ï„Î¬ ÎœÎ±Î¸Î¸Î±Î¯Î¿Î½ or ÎšÎ±Ï„Î¬ ÎœÎ±Ï„Î¸Î±Î¯Î¿Î½, Kata Maththaion or Kata Matthaion) is a synoptic gospel in the New Testament, one of four canonical gospels. ...

Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.

Sermon   After the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the Canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapter is written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.

God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must 'abide' in him if they are to 'bear fruit'. The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to  love one another  in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the  greatest love  as being the willingness to  lay down  life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.

Paraclete  means ""comforter"", ""counsellor"", or ""advocate"", and is traditionally understood as referring to the  Holy Spirit . When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  filioque clause  which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the  paraclete  was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this  paraclete  that had been promised.

The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Par-take of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.

Last Supper, Detail from the Middle - Painting by Leonardo Da Vinci, 1498 From  Austin Cline , About.com    See More About: leonardo da vinci da vinci code jesus holy grail last supper            Dan Brown's book The Da Vinci Code is about finding the Holy Grail, but Brown's religious ideas are as bad as the orthodoxy he contradicts. Prev Next Gallery Index Image  5  of  7 Last Supper, painting by Leonardo Da Vinci, 1498, Detail from the Middle To Jesus' immediate right are Judas, Peter, and John in another group of three. Judas is in shadow, clutching the bag of silver he was paid for betraying Jesus. He is also reaching for a piece of bread just as Jesus is saying to Thomas and James (seated to Jesus' left) that the betrayer would take a piece of bread from Jesus.   Peter appears very angry here and is holding a knife, both of which may be allusions to how he will react in Gethsemane when Jesus is betrayed and arrested. John, the youngest of the twelve apostles, appears to be swooning at the news.   With the stage set, let's consider the claim made by Dan Brown and followers of his ideas is that there is no cup in Leonardo Da Vinci's  Last Supper . They use this as evidence for the idea that the ""real"" Holy Gail wasn't a cup at all, but Mary Magdalene who was married to Jesus and the mother of his child whose descendants were, among others, the Merovingian Dynasty. This terrible ""secret"" is supposed to be something that Catholic Church officials are willing to kill over.   The problem for this theory is that it's plainly false: Jesus is obviously pointing to a cup with his right hand, even as his left hand is pointing to a piece of bread (the Eucharist). Leonardo Da Vinci worked hard to make his art as realistic as possible so this ' some magnificent, jewel-encrusted chalice used by kings; instead, it's a simple cup that would be used by a simple carpenter (though not of clay, as it probably would have been).    Anyone who has seen  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  will be familiar with what's going on here; Dan Brown, it seems, has chosen poorly.

The Last Supper  ( Convent of Sta. Maria delle Grazie ,  Milan ,  Italy  (1498), by  Leonardo da Vinci ).       In the Christian  Gospels , the  Last Supper  (also called the  Lord's Supper  or  Mystical Supper ) was the last meal  Jesus  shared with his  Twelve Apostles  and  disciples  before  his death . The Last Supper has been the subject of many paintings, perhaps  the most famous  by  Leonardo da Vinci .   According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". Other events and dialogue are recorded in the  Synoptic Gospels  and the  Gospel of John . Many Christians describe this as the ""Institution of the  Eucharist "" (see  Maundy Thursday ).   The vessel which was used to serve the wine is sometimes called the  Holy Chalice , and has been the one of the supposed subjects of  Holy Grail  literature in  Christian mythology .

Paul the Apostle was the first to write of the Last Supper. He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location       Main article:  Cenacle       According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances       Main article:  Maundy Thursday              The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape       Main article:  Agape feast               Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

The book has been widely cited as being in the tradition of  Oswald Chambers ' devotional guide decades earlier. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Criticism   A Lutheran perspective is that Warren fails to present the evangelical Christian gospel accurately--failing to accurately represent the nature of  sin , repentance and hell, as well as the blood sacrifice of God's son  Jesus  as the means to be forgiven by God for sins and which allows man to have a relationship with God. [ 6 ]  Warren has been accused of absolving his readers of moral responsibility by making Satan into an all-pervasive godlike figure contrary to both orthodox theology and psychological soundness. [ 7 ]  It has been suggested that when citing Scripture, Warren jumps from one Bible version to another, cherry-picking whichever paraphrase or translation supports whatever point he attempts to convey, [ 8 ]  although the practice of using translations selectively has been defended. [ 9 ]  Warren's statement that ""Whenever God wanted to prepare someone for his purposes, he took forty days"" [ 10 ]  has been criticized as both overly broad and contradicted by Scripture.

The Last Supper has been the subject of many paintings, perhaps  the most famous  by  Leonardo da Vinci .   According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". Other events and dialogue are recorded in the  Synoptic Gospels  and the  Gospel of John . Many Christians describe this as the ""Institution of the  Eucharist "" (see  Maundy Thursday ).   The vessel which was used to serve the wine is sometimes called the  Holy Chalice , and has been the one of the supposed subjects of  Holy Grail  literature in  Christian mythology .

He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Main article:  Cenacle   According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances   Main article:  Maundy Thursday          The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape   Main article:  Agape feast           Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

Warren, who's at the center of a growing controversy over his inaugural invitation from the president-elect, said Prop. 8 became more about free speech than anything else. Speaking of free speech, as reported here, the  L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center  strongly criticized Obama  on Thursday for his invitation to Warren to pray with the immense crowd at the opening of the inaugural ceremony. The group also demanded that the Democratic president-elect disinvite Warren from participating.    Obama has said  he doesn't agree with some things Warren says  and vice versa, but Warren invited him to speak in August at the Saddleback Forum. And, Obama adds, disagreeing with someone doesn't mean being disagreeable to each other. That's something his campaign has preached about for two years. Listen to Obama explain it himself on the video.     Warren, who heads the mega-church Saddleback in Lake Forest, says he's got no problem with gays having relationships; just don't call it marriage, he says. Marriage is between one man and one woman and has been for 5,000 years in numerous religions.    Warren also points out that his congregation has donated many millions of dollars to help gays with AIDS, which couldn't possibly be labeled homophobic.

You have to be very, *very* out of touch to be unaware of what a sore spot that is.  People in the LGBT community often hear from far-right religious conservatives that AIDS was a punishment from god for their ""sinful lifestyle.""  I find it rather interesting that Warren keeps statistics on how many of his charity recipients are homosexual.    There is a lot of effort to downplay this issue right now, and to the LGBT community it is a deep frustration.  We view Warren's position as homophobic, and homophobia itself to be another form of racism.  To us, allowing Warren to give this speech would be identical to allowing a Klansman to swear in a president in the 1950s.  Disagree with this position if you choose, but to suggest that there's little symbolic importance to Warren's speech is to completely fail to grasp the way that LGBT activists view the issue.             Posted by:    Schmidty |     December 19, 2008 at 08:56 AM                       It's the height of hypocrisy on both their parts.  This invitation should have been politely declined by Pastor Warren on the grounds that he and Obama have values that are diametrically opposed to one another and would cause dissent rather than goodwill on both sides of the fence.  This mutual decision diminishes the credibility of both men and puts a damper on what would otherwise be a momentous occasion.             Posted by:    DSciulla |     December 19, 2008 at 08:57 AM                       Rick Warren focuses on AIDS in Africa, where the preponderance of cases are among straight people. He ignores AIDS in California and AIDS within the gay community. Jesus healed everybody, Rick.     Further, any pastor who fuses politics with religion in the way Warren does (even though he claims not to, lying is a sin, Rick) is not civil. Warren compared homosexuality to pedophilia. That's civil? He compared abortion to the holocaust? That's civil? Hypocrisy is a sin, Rick. He questioned the faith of progressive Christians and accused us of being Marxists (Godless) tools of the Democratic Party. Questioning my faith is civil? Bearing false witness against a fellow believer is a sin Rick.     What Rick Warren is really about is $elling his books and acquiring fame. And just like his minions on the far-right, he has a gigantic ego. And he knowingly and willingly fuels the flames of the culture war to get what he wants. Beneath the fuzzy beard, is Jerry Falwell in a Hawaiian shirt. It probably won't be long until Rick accuses Elmo of being gay propaganda.

Color this pastor ""love!""  What should we color Rev. Wright?

Posted by:    steve rodriguez |     December 19, 2008 at 10:49 AM                       Obama has no reason to help gays & lesbians. Democrats will always have the bulk of the gay vote, & they don't need to do anything to get it, as gays & lesbians know that Republican treatment would be worse.  So, Democrats give lip service to gays & lesbians just to make sure that they go out & vote. After that, Democrats have no incentive to help gays; it would just upset the bulk of Americans.  Obama is a typical Democrat.  Then again, Lincoln was hated in his time, & the Emancipation Proclamation was condemned by most everyone when it was introduced.  Maybe people should think on that sometime--it is a fantasy, no politician will ever help gays & lesbians--but sometimes it's something to think about.

Marriage is between one man and one woman and has been for 5,000 years in numerous religions.""    So what?    How many thousands of years in numerous lands did slavery exist?  Seems there were quite a few slaves and concubines and multiple wives approvingly mentioned in the Bible.  We'd probably still be slaves now if it were up to the Bible.  Yet the Bible [or its self-appointed interpreters and enforcers] is supposed to define marriage for us, too.    Are we living in a theocracy?  Who just got elected President, Barack Obama or Rick Warren?  Does Rick Warren think he has the right to dictate what constitutes civil marriage?             Posted by:    tomk |     December 19, 2008 at 12:03 PM                       Pastor Warren sets a good example of true charity.It's  one thing to deplore aids and insist on government funding  but it is the mark of a true Christian to put up his own  money in a significant way.Equal rights does not equate  to granting homosexual mariage.Pope John Paul showed  us the light when he said to love your homosexual neighbor but condemn homosexual acts.Homosexual  exhibitionism such as so called gay pride parades serve  only to scandalize and poison the minds of vulnerable  and curious young minds.What responsable parent wants his or her teenagers to watch such turpitude?             Posted by:     Praise the Lord  |     December 19, 2008 at 12:22 PM                       Ok, so according to Rick Warren, Gay Marriage is the same as Incest, Polygomy and Pedophilia.   I guess he would also allow rights for all of those unless it is called Marriage.  Religious people should stay out of politics, makes them look stupid.             Posted by:    Taylor |     December 19, 2008 at 01:46 PM                       If Rick Warren had been anti-Black, anti-Hispanic, anti-Asian, anti-Jew, anti-any other minority other than gay, then he would not have been given a place at Obama's inaugural table because it would have been wrong to give such a person a platform in which to give validity to their bigotry.  But since Warren is anti-gay, Obama tries to defend his choice by saying he wants to listen to differing viewpoints.  Bigotry is bigotry, no matter what rhetoric you wrap it in.  If we are to use Obama's failed logic on this issue, then white supremacists should have a chair at Obama's inaugural table (but they won't because we know their positions on social issues are wrong, just as Rick Warren is wrong).  Obama blew it with this one.  It is painfully obvious to anyone with a brain that this is simply pandering to the radical religious whack jobs who have held this country hostage, via the Bush regime, for the last 8 years.  With this most egregious of decisions, Obama has flushed his credibility down the toilet.  This is not change we can believe in.  This is just more of the same garbage that gay people have had to deal with the last 8 years.  And it stinks.  Obama benefitted greatly from gay people's, their friends', and their families' financial donations and their votes (including financial donations and vote from this gay person).  And how are we repaid?  We are thrown under the bus.  The hearts and minds of a huge segment of the U.S. population are lost by such a purely political maneuver, and we cannot be one people/one country because of it.  Here's hoping Obama wises up.  If he wants to fix this country, he's going to need everyone's involvement, and right now, gays, their families, and friends are feeling like their involvement in cleaning up this country is neither wanted nor desired.  Not a good message.  Not a good way to begin Obama's presidency.  Not good at all.  And there's no excuse for it.                 Posted by:    Russ |     December 19, 2008 at 02:31 PM                       Rick Warren will get his in hell with the others who use God as a means for power and profit.    Obama is a fool to invite this demon in.             Posted by:    Sally |     December 19, 2008 at 03:19 PM                       I am disgusted that Obama chose this right wing extreamist to give the invocation. It makes me sick to think that this man and not a mainstream or moderate religous leader is give this honor. I am starting to think Hillary WAS the better choice.             Posted by:    Carlin |     December 19, 2008 at 03:21 PM                       Warren says that   'Marriage is between one man and one woman and has been for 5,000 years in numerous religions.'  And in numerous religions,marriage has not been between one man and one woman.  His weasel words befit a politician rather than a minister.    Marriage is not merely a religious term.  It is a state institution or construct and carries with it many legal benefits.    Marriage, as a matter of law, is not merely a ""privilege"" as I heard Huckabee recently claim.  As a matter of constitutional law, marriage is a right.  Moreover, it is a fundamental right, and any law impinging on that right is subject to strict scrutiny.    That is why prop 8 will ultimately fail.  While there may be a sufficient state interest to define marriage as a union between 2 adult unrelated people, there is no  (non-religious) interest that could possibly be compelling enough to deny 2 gay adults the right to marry.  Conversely, there are compelling reasons to allow them to marry.    There is a reason why in this country we have the rule of law.  The rule of law protects the rights of minorities from majority discrimination and worse.     As  constitutional law scholar, Obama knows this.               Posted by:    Jan |     December 19, 2008 at 09:47 PM                       I, like so many of my gay friends, gave a lot of money to Obama's campaign. We worked tirelessly to get him elected. Now Obama decides to invite Rick Warren, who equates gays to rapists and child molesters; and who excludes gays from being members of his church to do the invocation?  How many of Warren's followers do you think gave as much to the campaign as gays did?  How many of Warren's followers worked as hard to get Obama elected as gays did?  Warren is to gays what a Grand Wizard of the KKK is to African Americans.  Obama has made it perfectly clear with this invitation how he feels about the gay community.      Do you think Obama would have had as much of a landslide if it wasn't for the gay community?  I don't think so.  I hope for his sake that all the evangelicals he is pandering to move over to his camp come reelection time; gays will be voting for a third party candidate from now on. It's been made perfectly clear that the Democrats don't want us. Good luck to Obama with his presidency.  I don't support him any longer. I, like so many fell utterly betrayed.

God Bless you and your ministry.             Posted by:    Patricia Weisz |     December 20, 2008 at 07:32 AM                       It seems strange that a preacher who holds to the bible would be approve of homosexuality in any form or label. I doubt that Rick Warren actually is ""okay"" with it. I think what he really implied is that he is okay with it being legal (just like it's legal to smoke cigarettes). Whether Obama believes that gays should have the same rights as married people, he is trying to distance himself from far left-wing preachers. This does not mean he endorses Warren's beliefs or political opinions. Also, why does who prays at the inauguration have to be a political statement? I generally dislike Obama's politics, but criticizing the man for honoring a religious leader who was respectful towards him seems ridiculous and petty. Of course, in recent years, the gay community has always been known to be loud and obnoxious about EVERY perceived slight. Free publicity, eh? I believe the constant push for attention from gays is backfiring ala prop 8. If you guys actually want to sway people, don't whine about the small stuff. It only serves to energize your opposition.             Posted by:    Brian |     December 20, 2008 at 08:02 AM                       The last place I thought I'd be posting a comment is the LA Times.  However, I'm getting tired of this...    Yes, Warren's views are contrary to certain groups of individuals - and he has certainly vocalized his strong opinions.    But strong opinions are not unique to Warren.      Those that disagree with him have very strong opinions too - and these are also well vocalized.    To me, tolerance is a two way street.  Those that demand tolerance should walk the walk.      In my mind, there is going to be controversy regarding same sex marriage for many years to come.      However, to demand censorship of an individual - because of a single aspect of one's beliefs - seems to me at least - just as intolerant.    Obama has not claimed agreement with all - including his own cabinet members (a marked change from his predecessor who installed ""yes man"" at every corner).      To that end, this innocuous pick should be seen for what it is - a political calculation designed to dampen suspicion and even instill goodwill among his most vocal opponents: the evangelical right.    And make no mistake, the goodwill thus created could - and by all statistics WOULD - outstrip any displeasure and acrimony that the vocal minority in the LGBT community could generate.    In fact, such displeasure would - and will - only prompt a longer and more reflective pause for the right to re-examine their attitudes regarding Obama.  This is part of his calculation and it WILL work - to a greater or lesser degree.      The LGBT constituency is a lock.  Most of this said base exist in States that are very light blue - and are of no real threat.  Their non-support in future would mean little.      The right - on the other hand - could ensure an overwhelming victory in 2012 - only if he plays his cards ""right""...    Obama believes it's a gamble worth taking...(regardless of the noisy outrage that it will prompt - and which will again - promote and project an image that the far more numerous right can live with and possibly support)...    The editorials contained herein and the loud complaints aired over the networks only advance his position amongst those that he is trying to connect with at this time...

Wright preach hate in Jesus' name.  All those liberals out there who voted for Obama should not be surprised then that Obama asked Rick Warren, another preacher of hate in Jesus' name, to pray that Jesus damn all American gays and Jews to hell. Obama is and will always be a divisionist revisionist, just look at his cabinet choices.  Get ready for a bumpy ride.

Posted by:    walter |     December 21, 2008 at 12:45 PM                       Dear Mr President-Elect & his Transition Team,    Considering the promises & circumstances of your campaign, this Inauguration belongs to ALL people. To have Pastor Warren to deliver the Invocation is a fundamental antithesis to what we hope your presidency will be. His advocacy to categorically strip civil rights from a group of citizens will forever mar this historical event. There will be other occasions for dialogue & reconciliation for the contending issues, but this invitation to Pastor Warren is definitely inappropriate for the symbolic re-birth of the great nation, and is clearly disrespectful to your millions of supporters who yearn for a fair & just society.    Sincerely yours,    Pak TAM    Help our voice to be heard!

Rick Warren publicly compares rape of a minor by an adult or sex between a brother and sister with two consenting in love adults of the same sex! He was a general in the war to push prop 8 in California which constitutionalized the exclusion of a certain right for a certain segment of the population which is afforded to the greater part of the population. This is not acceptable in a new America moving in a new direction not full of hate and disdain for anyone unlike ourselves which is what this preacher openly stands for. Obama disassociated with pastor Wright who married him and his wife, whose church he attended happily for a considerably long time - just because Wright had obvious difficulty controlling his painbody, built justifiably mostly if not entirely on being a part of a peoples who suffered through slavery Jim crow separate but almost equal etc to the point that it actually touched his lifetime. Yet Obama invites this preacher Rick Warren to give the inaugural invocation - someone who views with the worst disdain a segment of our population who at no time ever caused any harm to him or his family or friends - simply because they do not stand for the same principles as he does and he doesnt approve of what they do in private which is no different than what he or others he DOES relate to do in their private moments. It is just not fair to allow him this celebratory platform which can not help but express his totality of beliefs including his candy-coated hate for the simple fact that he so openly expresses them elsewhere. And this is not the message the world and us need to hear. Not on such an important occasion for sure! Please reconsider letting Rick Warren speak or pray at your event. The passing of prop 8 was one of the few dark clouds that loomed and wrecked havoc on an otherwise phenomenal choosing of Obama as pres elect. Now that same threat threatens to rain on the opening ceremony of what should be one of the brightest days in American history. Rick Warren also openly admits in the past that anyone who does not believe in his god is well on the path of ultimate doom. In the words of Obama, ""While we have come a long way since the Stonewall riots in 1969, we still have a lot of work to do. Too often, the issue of LGBT rights is exploited by those seeking to divide us. But at its core, this issue is about who we are as Americans. It's about whether this nation is going to live up to its founding promise of equality by treating all its citizens with dignity and respect."" -- Barack Obama, June 1, 2007. How can Rick Warren be allowed this honor with such an acting divisive agenda at hand? There are so many god loving evangelical pastors and such who openly and inwardly express openness and compassion to and for all, seeing each and all of us as gods children. Obama should choose someone else other than Rick Warren. The nation is already sensitive about separation between church and state. As a non-follower of any religion myself , my heart and mind are certainly open to religious peoples who have love, kindness and blessings for all. It is not religion that is scary. What is scary is the teaching of intolerance and acting apon it, done in the name of religion or not. I would be open to meeting and acting friendly towards Warren if he were to treat me with the same respect I would expect of myself towards him, regardless of his personal views. But only to work together on building an understanding and respect for each other. Not to listen to him preach as if he were no part of limiting the rights and freedom of loving individuals who only wish to fully express their love for each other in the same way most others legally do. Rick Warren DOES deserve the dignity and respect he wont himself afford the LGBT community  YES. That does not include just handing him a platform to show himself off for the whole world to see - along with all his past, present and future institutionalized hateful actions beside him. No matter how sugar coated his words may be for the inaugural invocation, elsewhere he is actively and successfully working against respect and dignity for all, even through changes in law and constitution (prop 8. Ca.). Rick Warren as mellow a demeanor he may have is an acting divisive evangelical who wants no part of equal respect, dignity and rights for all individuals  period. He not only gives a bad name to evangelicals - He also gives a bad name to all of us if allowed to cast his darkness of  non-respect and disregard of dignity for all behind his words of inaugural invocation. There are so many god loving evangelical pastors and such who openly and inwardly express openness and compassion to and for all, seeing each and all of us as gods children. Obama should choose someone else other than Rick Warren to reflect the aspect of our society he is looking to showcase through Warren  please. It is offensive to all of us if he is allowed to give the inaugural invocation. As a straight person myself, I sense no separation between the suffering of others and myself. And I have seen many peoples lives affected by prop 8 first hand and find no comfort that their lack of full dignity and respect by people and now by STATE CONSTITUTION does not affect me the same. It still saddens my heart and mind and creates an oppressive environment for all of us. Even Jerry Brown AG of Ca. has now decided prop 8 is unconstitutional. Yet Rick Warren does not care about the constitution and only wishes to further his religiously oriented political agenda by maintaining his stance that any overturning of prop 8 would be a violation of the will of the voters  that is not how law and the constitution work. There are safeguards in place to protect majority rule over minority groups in areas such as assuring rights and freedoms are equal to all. Rick Warren does not reflect anything we as a nation or a world should be proud of other than his sugar-coated general appearance, tone and mannerism. When it comes to specific rights and freedom for all along with the dignity and respect they entail, Rick Warren has little to no regard for the dignity and respect of people who do not think like he does to the point of ACTIVELY limiting their freedoms and rights through INSTITUTIONALIZED HATETRED! Which not only brings great pain and sorrow to the LGBT community, but to their families and friends lives as well. Again, There are so many god loving evangelical pastors and such who openly and inwardly express openness and compassion to and for all, seeing each and all of us as gods children. Obama should choose someone else other than Rick Warren to reflect the aspect of our society you were looking to showcase through Warren  please             Posted by:    james |     December 29, 2008 at 08:22 PM                       Once again religion and politics clash like titans.  When will america be like Jesus instead of thinking they are him and he is theirs.  You all spend so much time trying to convince each other of how holy/or not you are that in the process people are left to die on battle fields across the universe. Jesus was LOVE, unconditional, not religion and I see more of the latter than the former. WAKE UP AMERICA and Mr Obama call on the lord if you will not man.

clueweb09-enwp01-53-09719	"                     The Purpose Driven Life          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  PurposeDrivenLife.com )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                  The Purpose Driven Life  book cover       The Purpose Driven Life  (2002) is a  devotional  book written by  Christian  author  Rick Warren  and published by  Zondervan . The book has been on the  New York Times  Best Seller list  for advice books for one of the longest periods in history, while also becoming arguably one of the best-selling  non-fiction  books of all time, topping the  Wall Street Journal  best seller charts as well as  Publishers Weekly  charts with over 30 million copies in print by 2006. [ 1 ]   The book offers readers a 40-day personal spiritual journey, and presents what Warren says are  God 's five purposes for  human  life on  Earth  and describes itself as ""a  blueprint  for Christian living in the 21st Century ... using over 1200  Biblical  verses and quotes to challenge the conventional definitions of  Christian Worship ,  Fellowship ,  Discipleship ,  Christian Ministry  and  Evangelism .""           Contents       1   Content   2   Impact   3   Criticism   4   Ashley Smith   5   See also   6   References   7   External links               [ edit ]   Content   The book is intended to be read as a daily inspiration, with each of the 40 short chapters read on consecutive days. Each chapter contains a personal application section at the end with a ""point to ponder,"" a verse to remember, and a question to consider over the course of that day. Rick Warren described his book as an ""anti-self-help book."" The first sentence of the book reads, ""It's not about you,"" [ 2 ]  and the remainder of the chapter goes on to explain how the quest for personal fulfillment, satisfaction, and meaning can only be found in understanding and doing what God placed you on Earth to do. [ 3 ]  The book's 40 chapters are divided into six major sections, with the following titles: [ 4 ]     What on Earth Am I Here For?   Purpose #1: You Were Planned for God's Pleasure (Worship)   Purpose #2: You Were Formed for God's Family (Fellowship)   Purpose #3: You Were Created to Become Like Christ (Discipleship)   Purpose #4: You Were Shaped for Serving God (Ministry)   Purpose #5: You Were Made for a Mission (Mission)       [ edit ]   Impact   Since September 2002, over 30,000  congregations ,  corporations , and  sports  teams across the  United States  have participated in a ""40 Days of Purpose"" emphasis. [ citation needed ]  A May 2005 survey of American pastors and ministers conducted by  George Barna  asked Christian leaders to identify what books were the most influential on their lives and ministries. The  Purpose Driven Life  was the most frequent response.  The Purpose Driven Church , Warren's previous book, was the second most frequent response. [ 5 ]   Billy Graham  described the book as one that would ""guide you to greatness- through living the Great Commandment and the  Great Commission  of  Jesus ."" The book has been widely cited as being in the tradition of  Oswald Chambers ' devotional guide decades earlier. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Criticism   A Lutheran perspective is that Warren fails to present the evangelical Christian gospel accurately--failing to accurately represent the nature of  sin , repentance and hell, as well as the blood sacrifice of God's son  Jesus  as the means to be forgiven by God for sins and which allows man to have a relationship with God. [ 6 ]  Warren has been accused of absolving his readers of moral responsibility by making Satan into an all-pervasive godlike figure contrary to both orthodox theology and psychological soundness. [ 7 ]  It has been suggested that when citing Scripture, Warren jumps from one Bible version to another, cherry-picking whichever paraphrase or translation supports whatever point he attempts to convey, [ 8 ]  although the practice of using translations selectively has been defended.

I've spent 20 years under his tutelage learning about leadership from him."" RW And  read everything Peter Drucker writes. His book he Effective Executive"" is a favourite I re-read every year. Long before words like mpowermentbecame popular, Peter was telling us that the secret of achieving results is to focus on your strengths, and the strengths of those you work with, rather than focusing on weaknesses. In fact, Peter says, making strengths productive is the unique purpose of organisation.  find out what others do well and help them to be able to do more of it. This is the key to effective businesses, effective churches, and every other effective organisation. Great organisations position people for success rather than trying to eliminate all their weaknesses. It's far easier to manage weaknesses than to eliminate all of them.(BUILDING ON YOUR STRENGTHS - By Rick Warren) The Drucker-Warren relationship may surprise many readers, but it goes back two decades, to when the young minister came to Drucker for advice. Under Drucker's tutelage, Warren's own success as a spiritual entrepreneur has been considerable. Saddleback has grown to 15,000 members and has helped start another 60 churches throughout the world. Warren's 2001 book, The Purpose-Driven Life, is this decade's best seller with 19.5 million copies sold so far and compiling at the rate of 500,000 per month.nbsp; (http://www.forbes.com/home/management/2004/11/19/cz_rk_1119drucker.html) Although Drucker is supposed to be a eligious man he is well known in the business world for Management techniques and business innovation Peter Drucker has written 35 books in all: 15 books deal with management, including the landmark books The Practice of Management and The Effective Executive; 16 cover society, economics, and politics; 2 are novels; and 1 is a collection of autobiographical essays.  His most recent book, Managing in the Next Society, was published in fall 2002.  (http://www.peter-drucker.com/about.html) Drucker advised Warren on the challenges of ministry and church building. This consultation is one Drucker and Warren have engaged in twice yearly for two decades   Drucker says uccessful leaders don't start out asking, ""What do I want to do?""

Mr. Drucker is now recognized as the grandfather of the ega-church' movement .    So Who is Peter Drucker? eter Drucker's parents were part of the Vienna Circle . The members met regularly to discuss philosophy, religion and society. This was a radical group of elite, affluent European intellectuals, who developed a new model of man and society.  Many of their ideas were rooted in German mysticism. Young Peter Drucker grew up with an aptitude for philosophical analysis and he incorporated innovative social theories into his Systems Management ideas so popular today. His social theory is found in an article posted on his official website. The article is  he Age of Social Transformation/I> .  ( www.christianquill.com/ ) Did we miss something here? Why does a Baptist Preacher spend 20 years under the tutelage of a business man.. What happened to years of staying at Jesusfeet?  Wouldn that be all the knowledge and wisdom a pastor would need?   Not in today   Market Driven Church   which focuses is on what the consumer (Unchurched Harry) wants and thinks he needs, rather than on what God wants and what He says Harry needs. In other words, market-driven churches are built upon the foundation of polls, surveys, and the latest marketing techniques, instead of upon the Word of God.    {TOP OF PAGE}   R ick Warren and Rupert Murdoch The picture on the left is a screen shot taken from  The Sun , a UK based tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch News Corporation.  age 3of the paper is little more than oft porn However Rupert Murdoch is supposed to be a born-again Christian and Rick Warren claims to be his pastor: In the Sept 12, 2005 edition of the  New Yorker Rick Warren said:  had dinner with Jack Welch last Sunday night,he said. ""He came to church, and we had dinner. I've been kind of mentoring him on his spiritual journey. And he said to me, 'Rick, you are the biggest thinker I have ever met in my life. The only other person I know who thinks globally like you is Rupert Murdoch.' And I said, 'That's interesting.  I'm Rupert's pastor! Rupert published my book!'""  Then he tilted back his head and gave one of those big Rick Warren laughs. (www.pastors.com/RWMT/article.asp?ArtID=9636.

""I don't have to agree with 100 percent of what another person does in order to work with them on the 20 percent that we do agree on,"" Warren says. That pragmatic attitude has paid off. Murdoch was among the first to support the PEACE plan, donating $2 million. Other business leaders, such as John Kang, a Saddleback member and tech-industry CEO, and Joe Ritchie, a Chicago businessman and former options trader, donated time and expertise. [ Source ] Additionally an article called evealed: Murdoch growing adult television empire by Rupert Steiner in the online magazine  The Business  states RUPERT Murdoch, the born-again Christian who chairs media giant News Corporation, has been secretly building a stable of wholly-owned pornographic channels for his BSkyB subsidiary. The Business has learnt that BSkyB now owns and operates its own pornographic channels the 18+ Movies selection after years of hosting third-party content only.  Historically BSkyB, under its licence agreement, had no choice but to host every channel that won permission from the industry regulator Ofcom. The regulator agrees a fixed fee for the use of the platform by third parties. But BSkyB has been secretly expanding its activities in the growing business of pornographic television with its wholly owned 18+ Movies offering. The company has also been entering into partnerships with companies that broadcast pornographic television channels on BSkyB, such as Sport XXX Babes, XXX Housewives and Playboy.  BSkYB has agreed retail distribution agreements with these companies. With Playboy, for instance, BSkyB now not only hosts the channel but sells its service, and collects and shares in the revenues from Playboy customers.

Warren managed to speak for the entire evening without once mentioning Jesus a testament to his savvy message-tailoring.  But make no mistake, the driving purpose of an evangelical church is to evangelize, and it is Warren devotion to spreading the words of the Christian Bible that drive his ministry .  Good for him and his flock and not so bad for us either.  His teachings apply to 95 percent of all people, regardless of religious belief.  As he put it to a group of rabbis at a conference last year using a metaphor that might be described as a Paulian slip: at the fish and throw away the bones. Warren told Wolfson  his interest is in helping all houses of worship, not in converting Jews .  He said there are more than enough Christian souls to deal with for starters . The success of Warren second book, he Purpose-Driven Life(Zondervan, 2002), demonstrates  his ability to turn a particular gospel into a universal one Finally  imilarly, Warren has leveraged his fame to bring attention to AIDS in Africa and other global problems.

While he was at Sinai Temple, his wife, Kay, was at the White House    Words can not express how tired I am of this man who claims to be a Christian pastor, yet can speak for the entire evening in a Jewish temple and not once mention Jesus.  He wants to help all houses of worship but does not want to convert Jews. How precisely is he helping them then? Is his marketing expertise going to enable them to add to their congregations or perhaps raise more money? Wow!

It is a fact that the ""40 Days of Purpose"" and other church growth and leadership materials produced by Rick Warren are aggressively marketed to Mormons and others outside Christian orthodoxy.

Mormonism...a ""denomination"" and on-essentialssuch as the identity of Jesus Christ, godhood for mankind or the route to eternal salvation???  [See Section on  Mormonism ] Clearly, Warren doesn't KNOW or doesn't WANT to identify Mormonism as non-Christian. Either way, what  USA Today  didn't report is that Rick Warren is helping train Mormon leaders to more effectively present a false religion to the world - a false religion that has led millions of lost souls to an eternal Hell. Now, we find listed alongside a Mitt Romney promo video on the popular YouTube website that one of his favorite books is listed as...you guessed it,  The Purpose Driven Life .

Both Christians and Mormons should scratch their heads in wonder.

There is no entry fee. Essays should be no more than 3,500 words in English, entrants are to be 18 years of age or older. he award-winning essays in this competition will be selected by this distinguished panel of judges, all of whom have exemplified throughout their lives and careers a strong and unmistakable understanding of The Power of Purpose. The Templeton web site says  n day-to-day life, we encounter men and women who seem driven by something outside of themselves, whose commitment to their profession or volunteer activities, their community, or their cause seems to rise above the necessary, above the possible, above even the human. Indeed, we say that in such people we see he divine spark. Many religious traditions, both Eastern and Western, subscribe to the idea that there is something of God presence in each of us. Even for the growing number of people who describe themselves as spiritual, but not necessarily religious, there is a certain attachment to this concept of the divine spark. It is the sense that our lives can be guided from within by something more important than our simple survival, something not merely intellectual either, something in our souls.nbsp;  http://www.templeton.org/powerofpurpose/about.html ew have done as much to promote a sense of unity among the world's religions than John Marks Templeton. Templeton has become world renowned for offering a million dollars as his annual prize from his religious research center that is dedicated to develop progress in religion. The Council for a Parliament of World Religions   promotes inter-religious dialogue and plans for the world's piritual future by having government institutionalize a global ethic.I have heard that Sir John Templeton serves on the Parliament of World Religions board of trustees, and while I have not been able to confirm this, it is known that the Templeton Foundation has been one of the the financial contributors to the Parliament. The Media Transparency Site lists a donation of $47,500 over two years (1999 and 2000). Additionally Templeton was linked to some very important and wealthy people that have been known to be involved in  Globalism , both politically and religiously. Additionally The Templeton Foundation has also made several substantial donations to the  Association of Unity Churches.  The Unity Church  website  has this to say...

A   Yes.

Religious Liberals Wrestle with the Rick Warren Decision                            Friday December 19, 2008                                                           Over at  Progressive Revival , there's some fascinating (and wise) disagreement breaking out over the Rick Warren selection:    Marianne Williamson is sharply critical:    ""The person who leads the nation in prayer on January 20th should be someone asking God to forgive us our sins, not someone who dresses up one of our baser national instincts in pseudo-religious packaging.""    Brian McLaren , a liberal evangelical who'se taken his lumps from his conservative brethren, refers to Warren,  Rich Cizik  and Obama as ""ideologically homeless:""     ""As we near Christmas, let's remember that the one whose birthday we're celebrating was homeless, wandered around, couldn't be tamed or contained by conventional categories, accepted and extended invitations to the wrong people, and had a boatload of critics.""    And, most interestingly,  Diana Butler Bass describes this as a spiritual challenge :    ""I don't really want to pray with Rick Warren.  But being the post-partisan progressive pilgrim that I am, I am willing to accept President-elect Obama's challenge that it may be good for the nation's soul if I--if we--do.  It is a much better option than casting those with whom we disagree into the darkness.  We've had too much of that in the last eight years.""    UDPATE: And this  powerful statement from Renita Weems:    Rick Warren's smiling, right wing, socially conservative, anti-gay, anti-women's rights biblical preaching has been deemed to be not as divisive as the blistering prophetic denunciations of American imperalism by his former pastor Jeremiah Wright. Reaching out to Warren reaps more political capital for Obama than does reaching out to Wright. The pro-gay rights man whose fiery preaching nurtured Obama into becoming the community organizer he is at heart remains a pariah, banished from the inaugural platform and the American public. The man whose anti-gay message is overshadowed by the fact that he represents the face of millions of conservative voters gets to pray for the country.

After all, as much as we may disagree with Warren on this issue, he is still part of the same Kingdom of God that we belong to. There is room in God's kingdom for all the reactions we are having to this issue. And none of this has derailed Christ from his reconciling work here on earth. Let's not let it derail us either.                                                              Your Name           December 20, 2008  1:36 PM        President-Elect Obama is delivering on a promise: inclusion.    Inclusion is not limited to those with whom we agree, it is inclusive of us all. I am not gay and I am not a fundamentalist Christian, but welcome to them both.    And, inclusion accomplishes a most critical societal task of enabling dialogue, discussion and change. Obama can accelerate this natural, cultural and social evolution by focusing attention and creating ""teachable moments.""    A long time ago, I stood up for equal rights for blacks.  And, at the same time, I was not comfortable with interracial dating or marriage (I was just a teenager.) In the dialogue that was opened in the 1960s, I experienced my own ""teachable moments"" and evolved to my present view that the more everyone intermarries, the better for us all. ""... content of character, not color..."" and so forth.    With gay people, I have been experiencing a similar evolution, mostly at the proding of my kids. I presume to say that we all are moving in the right direction, equality, though such cultural and social changes sometimes seem to be glacial in their pace.    Obama's inclusion of Rick Warren and those who follow Warren is a good step in the right direction. Inclusion and focus will bring inevitable progress.                                                              Your Name           December 27, 2008  5:47 PM        I fail to see what all the uproar is about. Christianity, Islam and Judaism says about the same thing about homosexual practice. I understand the point of view of those who do not believe in God; but from those who call themselves Christians, specifically the clergy, how do you interpret the scriptures pertaining to homosexuality and why? I would like to have where you are coming from as it pertains to scripture included with your opinion. This pertains to preachers and teachers. And to Renita Weems, sometimes it is the tone of the speech that detracts from the message.                                                              Whitney           January  1, 2009 10:31 PM        I personally don't see what the big deal is. If I'm not mistaken, it is up to Obama to choose exactly who he wants to perform his inauguration. Frankly, as someone who is both pro-choice and pro-gay marriage, I don't understand why these groups are wasting precious energy worrying about some pastor! Does the pro-choice community not realize that Bush has just made it legal for pro-life health practitioners not to provide information to pregnant women about abortion? Not only that, but they can extend the definition of abortion to include birth control - and refuse to distribute it or even refer a patient to someone who can provide them with birth control! Does the pro-gay marriage community not realize that there are people trying to annull legal gay marriages in California? And we're worried about some pastor we don't agree with? Obama ran on the premise of uniting America. His pick shouldn't shock anyone.    There are bigger things to worry about than who Obama chooses to do his inauguration. Just sayin'.                                                                Your Name           January  5, 2009  4:58 PM        After all the smoke clears you either hold to what scripture says about homosexual behavior or you reject it and take guidance from your own moral compass.    Just remember ""A human heart is more dishonest than anything else. It can't be healed. Who can understand it?   Where is your moral compass?

The book has been widely cited as being in the tradition of  Oswald Chambers ' devotional guide decades earlier. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Criticism   A Lutheran perspective is that Warren fails to present the evangelical Christian gospel accurately--failing to accurately represent the nature of  sin , repentance and hell, as well as the blood sacrifice of God's son  Jesus  as the means to be forgiven by God for sins and which allows man to have a relationship with God. [ 6 ]  Warren has been accused of absolving his readers of moral responsibility by making Satan into an all-pervasive godlike figure contrary to both orthodox theology and psychological soundness. [ 7 ]  It has been suggested that when citing Scripture, Warren jumps from one Bible version to another, cherry-picking whichever paraphrase or translation supports whatever point he attempts to convey, [ 8 ]  although the practice of using translations selectively has been defended. [ 9 ]  Warren's statement that ""Whenever God wanted to prepare someone for his purposes, he took forty days"" [ 10 ]  has been criticized as both overly broad and contradicted by Scripture. [ 11 ]  Warren has also been accused of rejecting rational criticism of religion and asserting that morality derives exclusively from religion.

clueweb09-en0002-51-17428	  /blogs CNN Political Ticker « Back to Blog Main             Rick Warren to give inaugural invocation   Posted: December 17, 2008 1409  GMT       Rick Warren hosted a presidential forum in August.         (CNN)  — President-elect Barack Obama’s swearing-in ceremony will feature big names like minister Rick Warren and legendary singer Aretha Franklin, the Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies announced Wednesday.   Warren, the prominent evangelical and founder of the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, will deliver the ceremony’s invocation. The minister hosted a presidential forum at his church last summer that challenged both Obama and Arizona Sen. John McCain on a host of faith-related issues. Warren did not endorse either presidential candidate.   His public support for California’s Proposition 8 — the measure that successfully passed and called for outlawing gay marriage in the state — sparked the ire of many gay rights proponents, who seized on a comment in an October newsletter to his congregation: “This is not a political issue — it is a moral issue that God has spoken clearly about.”   But Warren has long sought to broaden the focus of the evangelical agenda to include issues like the reduction of global poverty, human rights abuses, and the AIDS epidemic.   Also included in the inaugural program are cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the United States Marine Band, and other performers.   Posted by:  CNN Ticker Producer Alexander Mooney    205 Comments                    Abortion December 17th, 2008 2:12 pm ET      Is he the one who asks Obama questions about life and abortion? And what is Obama’s answer??                         Bob Los Gatos December 17th, 2008 2:14 pm ET      He’s inviting some born-again and the Grateful Dead arent playing? Sheesh . . .                         ConsciousAmerican December 17th, 2008 2:16 pm ET      I’ve stayed pretty neutral about the choices of President Elect Obama but I question the selection of Rick Warren. The guy is erie and I question a number of his motives? I’m not feeling all spiritual and faithful in thinking about this guy….                         John, Brooklyn, New York December 17th, 2008 2:17 pm ET      So….once again, we gay Americans are being the first to be thrown overboard after we get a new president elected.  Clinton betrayed us with “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and by signing the “Defense of Marraige Act”.  BUT AT LEAST CLINTON PUT UP A FIGHT TO TRY TO END MILITARY DISCRIMINATION.   I had been inspired by the election of Obama.  I’m deeply saddened that he is embracing and welcoming such an advocate of division and discrimination as Pastor Warren.   Obama has now lost me….and many others with this action.  He’ll have to win me back.                         kayla December 17th, 2008 2:17 pm ET      WELL DONE GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT. PRESIDENT OBAMA                         Chuck December 17th, 2008 2:17 pm ET      Where will Stevie Wonder fit in with the ceremonies, given the fact that his songs were used extensively by the Obama Campaign                         Mickie December 17th, 2008 2:18 pm ET      That’s disappointing that Rick Warren will speak.  I believe he preaches for money and could care less about a person soul if it is poor.  I’m sure this will net him millions from his followers.                         Anton Williams December 17th, 2008 2:19 pm ET      For Obama to pick Rick Warren is a slap to the gay community.  It is a “moral issue” to take away rights from a minority, and who is next?                         Family First December 17th, 2008 2:19 pm ET      Barack Obama favors special rights for homosexuals.   Obama thinks people with this lifestyle should be allowed to adopt children, teach in schools, and engage in immoral acts.   Obama can’t fool me, he’s an extreme social liberal who is shamelessly using Rev Warren to seem moderate.   Sarah Palin 2012!                         greenfish December 17th, 2008 2:19 pm ET      This is a disappointment.  Fundamentalists of any ilk may me nervous; they’re so certain they have God on their side.   Where exactly does the Bible say homosexuality is wrong?  If we model marraige on practices from thousands of years ago, we should allow bigamy.                         Chuck December 17th, 2008 2:20 pm ET      Where will Stevie Wonder fit into the program given the fact that the Obama Campaign used his songs extensively.                         Yo-Yo yes! December 17th, 2008 2:20 pm ET      Yo-Yo — yay!!!   Rick Warren - yuck, who needs this jerk!                         Jackie in Dallas December 17th, 2008 2:20 pm ET      Get a life, people, he’s just giving the invocation. Too bad Billy Grahme could not…he is still one of the most respected evangilists in the world.                         Virginia December 17th, 2008 2:20 pm ET      Rick, I am surprised….                         Veronica December 17th, 2008 2:23 pm ET      Abortion   December 17th, 2008 2:12 pm ET   Is he the one who asks Obama questions about life and abortion? And what is Obama’s answer??   —-   Use the Googles on the internet tubes; that ought to help.   While far from religious, I am glad to see that at least some evangelicals, in particular, Rick Warren, realize that there are infinitely bigger issues we must contend with than abortion and gay marriage.                         BUSH BEGONE! December 17th, 2008 2:23 pm ET      Obama, your pushing the limits of tolerance by having this backward bible thumper playing such a main role in the inaugration.   How about a more tolerant religious spokesperson, were all the Methodists busy???                         Anne E. December 17th, 2008 2:25 pm ET      Terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad choice.                         CanIcallyouJoe December 17th, 2008 2:26 pm ET      Asking a preacher and established homophobe about his personal political views is like asking a serial killer on morals. Btw, the Catholic Church has either expunged all negative records or has denied comment on a issue that Barack Obama might find a bit interesting - slavery.   A preacher’s words on political matters should hold the weight of a feather.   “Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should “make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.”   -Thomas Jefferson, January 1st 1802, in a letter to the Danbury Baptists                         Barbara December 17th, 2008 2:27 pm ET      This is the first real big dissappointment I have had in Obama.  I have been a “rabid” supporter since the beginning……  Nothing makes me more nervous than the Evangelicals…  Their holier than thou attitude and intrusion in politics is  running rampant.

Obama thinks people with this lifestyle should be allowed to adopt children, teach in schools, and engage in immoral acts.   ****************************************  Oh no, not a loving homosexual couple adopting children.  Not a wonderful, dedicated homosexual teacher teaching our children.  The horror!     Obama doesn’t favor “special” rights, he favors “equal” rights, you know, because homosexuals are human beings too.   Oh and by the way, many heterosexual couples engage in immoral acts on a daily basis.  Get over it.  Doesn’t affect you what people do in their own bedrooms.                         Rob December 17th, 2008 2:27 pm ET      Excellent choice!  I commend both men.  I know that the invocation at the inauguration will not be Rick Warren’s first or last prayer for Obama.  We need more pastors like him, willing to use godly influence to help our leaders make the right decisions.

As far as different groups being thrown under the bus…minorities have always been thrown under the bus in this society…that’s why it’s so hard for “some” americans to accept Barack Hussein Obama as our 44th President…but I welcome him & his family to the White House, which was built with the blood & sweat of my ancestors, who are probably dancing in their graves right about now….

I think Kingdom of Heaven put it best. I’ve seen the word of god in the eye’s of too many murderers. I’ve seen the word of god in the eye’s of too many corupt. God is only in your mind and your heart.  Oh I don’t think Jesus would like the site of price tags on bibles either….or does God plan on making a profit on this whole religion thing.

Daniel December 17th, 2008 2:31 pm ET      I am surprised that Obama would choose an outspoken bigot like Rick Warren to open the inaugural cermeony.  Would a president-elect ever invite a member of the Ku Klux Klan to open a public ceremony?  I think not.  So why choose someone who has extreme views on minorities?  Rick Warren is nothing but a bigot, and Obama has done a great harm to his country  by inviting him to speak at the ceremony.  Very bad judgment on his part.

Scott NYC Independent December 17th, 2008 2:32 pm ET      Barbara - this is only one thing in an event that will take about 15 minutes, yet it will drastically reduce the support the republican base has among evangelicals without attaching policy or politics to the olive branch.

Stacy from Leesburg VA December 17th, 2008 2:36 pm ET      Pastor Warren uses the Bible as a book of hate and that is just wrong.

Culture bearer December 17th, 2008 2:36 pm ET      This Rick Warren has gotten stinking rich from selling his religious beliefs–cleverly packaged as self-help jargon. Christ said rich people should give all their money to the poor. This guy just uses it to build a bigger platform from which to incite hatred against gays. He says he has gay friends, but likens them to people who have sex with their siblings or sex with children. Really? Does he count those people among his friends as well? What a hypocrite. Shame on Obama for courting the gay vote while embracing those who use their riches to hurt gay people. Shame. I just hope Warren reveals his true feelings when he’s on the inauguration stage, so gays will stop expecting anything from this new administration.

Jonathan December 17th, 2008 2:41 pm ET      “Asking a preacher and established homophobe about his personal political views is like asking a serial killer on morals.”   Joe, religious leaders, just like everyone else in our country, have the express right to share their religious views. Be careful about painting too wide a path with saying that a preacher’s views on politics are as twisted and invalid on face as a serial killer’s views on morality. Even if it’s in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness, intolerance is still intolerance.                         Steph December 17th, 2008 2:43 pm ET      It’s about inclusion people. Stop saying that Barack has “lost you” because you don’t like a single decision he has made.    In the big scheme of things how much difference does the person giving the invocation make. I’d much rather have gay and lesbian members of the cabinet (which Obama has) than have a GLBT-friendly person giving the invocation.

A President that continues to display true Christian values as taught by Jesus Christ.  How many times has Barack Obama shown by example.  He has truly “turned the other cheek” on so many occasions.   The Saddleback Presidential Forum was fixed in John McCain’s favor.  John McCain obviously knew the questions in advance of the forum & evaded the “cone of silence” & heard Barack Obama’s responses in advance,  in the car on the way to the forum.   And, yet President-elect invites Rick Warren to do the Invocation.  God Bless the President-elect.

Annie, Atlanta December 17th, 2008 2:50 pm ET      I would have prefered a gay minister from a churce of inclusion, not exclusion.

They repersent the Jewish cultural view of that practice.  What is oft ommited by Evangelicals is what attitude they are to have concerning those engaged in the homosexual lifestyle.  It is considered a sin in the eyes of God as is murder, stealing and the rest of the do nots from the 10 Commandments which is sometimes condoned by these fundamentalists.  I am not an apologist for their lifestyle but they are people, someones son or daughter, or brother or sister, and their right to seek love and happiness should not be abridged.  Many people do not agree with the Evangelical positions on other matter as well.  Please stop trying to shove your religion down my throat, I don’t think you are any more moral than the rest of us.                         Jamaica Nice December 17th, 2008 2:52 pm ET      The Rev.

Mike in Vancouver December 17th, 2008 2:52 pm ET      While I understand that “evangelicals” are not without fault and viewed with suspicion and even contempt from the more liberally influenced, to paint all evangelical, conservative Christians that way is just ignorant and INTOLERANT (yes the word usually reserved for this distinguished group).   As an enthusiastic Obama supporter myself, I am disappointed with most of the posts of this group because you can substitute Rick Warren’s name for just about any evangelical; I was hoping that people would more follow Obama’s example and make an attempt to look beyond labels and into the person themselves, to see both the good and the bad.   For those of you afraid of any evangelical, that’s about as closed minded as conservatives being afraid of Obama because his middle name is Hussein (for example) - let’s go beyond labels!                         cynthia December 17th, 2008 2:53 pm ET      People get a grip!!

Barack Obama’s Change.Gov webpage ‘Civil rights area’ seems to be in total contradiction to this preacher’s viewpoints.  On Obama’s website, it seems clear that all of the LGBT issues (minus marriage) will be resolved to make LGBT citizens equal in this society as never before.  I am dissapointed by this choice since it seems to contradict Obama’s idea of inclusivity.  This preacher represents divisiveness in his viewpoints and represents an individual who wants to take away the rights of others (he voted Yes on Prop 8). This is certainly not what Obama has represented in his speeches in the past.                         John, Brooklyn, New York December 17th, 2008 2:54 pm ET      Specific to “Family First”.   You certainly wouldn’t consider marrying, adopting a child, keeping a job you are qualified for, remaining in an apartment when you’ve paid rent on time, or being approved for a car loan when you have great credit to be “special rights” if you were discussing them for straight people.  WHY, then, would you take a 180-degree turn and consider these - and countless other “basic rights” that apply to everyone in this nation - to be “special” only when they apply to gay people?    The term “homophobia” is too good for people like you.  It implies a neurotic condition that you have little control over.  No…the best term for you is “Bigot”.                         cgsailor December 17th, 2008 2:55 pm ET      This is hilarious…every Obama supporter knew he wasn’t telling the truth about something and every one of them thought it was somebody else’s main issue!  The poor sod hasn’t even taken office yet…I didn’t vote for him but even I have to at give him a chance to do the job since, like it or not, he’s going to be the President of the nation I love.                         Frann Altman in CA December 17th, 2008 2:56 pm ET      I would rather see President-elect Obama have a few religious leaders, not one, participate in the invocation for inauguration. This is really  where it’s important to see community joined together.     I want more people in the aisle that we reach across to connect with.   He needs to rethink this decision.                         Mike, Syracuse NY December 17th, 2008 2:56 pm ET      Anton, you can’t take away a ‘right’ that never existed.

Laverne December 17th, 2008 2:58 pm ET      I can’t beleive some of you guys.  He is not appointing the man to a cabinet position.  It is does not matter which pastor he chooses to perform his swearing in ceremony as long as they are a man or women of God.  Listen up, Obama has all the long said he is a Christian with strong faith.  He should not abandon that to please the far left.  This man is being pulled in so many directions, it is not funny.  He is making the last call on his decisions as he should and if you really support someone then you won’t demand their head off every time they make a decision you don’t agree with and don’t think this will be the only decision President Elect Obama will make that you don’t agree with.  If Pastor Warren had any reservations or got some kind of revelation to not participate in this event, I think he would have declined right away.   I also think it is a dangerous place to go when we start crucifying people who have been ordained to do God’s work including the Rev. Wright.  We were not put here to decide what punishment pastors should get when you disagree with their values.   LIfe is too short to be so petty about every single thing!                         John, Brooklyn, New York December 17th, 2008 2:58 pm ET      Specific to David Goldman…   A president of “all of the people” would not include those who would actively and work to exclude other members of the society from the public forum.  There are reasons that Obama has not invited neo-Nazi’s, the KKK, or the John Birch Society to be part of his inaguration.  These are also representative of “all of America”.  Using your logic, should we lengthen the invitation list to invite these folks too?  Hmmm?   Sounds like you are content as long as the people who might hate YOU aren’t there.

I thought the end of the Bush era would liberate the country from the grips of these Evangelical nutballs, with their thoughtless, emotive mega-churches and mega-herd instincts, and return us to a mainstream of more thoughtful religious practices. President-elect Obama, why are you inviting this kook to speak? I no longer plan to attend inauguration. I’d have preferred even Jeremiah Wright to speak; the Evangelicals are like America’s version of Hamas — fundamentalists with political ambitions that involve first and foremost a confusion of church and state.

Jiles Samson December 17th, 2008 3:00 pm ET      It is obvious from the comments that most people don’t really know who Rick Warren is.  He is evangelical.  He is not a prosperity preacher and doesn’t preach for money.  He is considered a suspect by many on the Evangelical Right and the Evangelical Left.  He is against redefining marriage from the globally-universally-throughout history position of one man and one woman, He is against abortion.  However, he is for the church being more active to help the poor, homeless, orphan, widow, aid, etc. (all of the above being what the Bible teaches).  Some conservative Evangelicals are suspicious of him and think he is too liberal and if he agrees to be a Obama’s invocation, they will be even more suspicious.  He is really kind of center-right in his politics.  Oh, and to greenfish on where the Bible says homosexuality is wrong, here is just ONE references (from the New Testament).   Romans 1:21 - For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened….26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.  Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.  27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.  Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.”   There are plenty more references.  Please, really read the Bible before you start to comment about that which you don’t know.                         fred December 17th, 2008 3:01 pm ET      i dunno Obama, having this guy speak might be above your pay grade hahahaha.   jk, good choice to give the invocation.                              fefe December 17th, 2008 3:01 pm ET      Let me just say this, PRESIDENT OBAMA , is for the people by the people i’m not a homophobic but i think people can do as they please i just strongly believe that stop trying to push your immoral views on others yes i said immoral. What did you think that PRESIDENT OBAMA was just gonna relinquish his views i think he put it as polite as he can lighten up people.                         Dave, Santa Barbara December 17th, 2008 3:02 pm ET      Way to go, Mr. Obama!   Rick Warren gave you the time of day when much of the evangelical world called you the Antichrist.                         Heifer December 17th, 2008 3:02 pm ET      Blowhards need representation, too.                         chuck December 17th, 2008 3:02 pm ET      I AM NOT A RICK WARREN FAN.HE HAD JOHN MCCAIN LISTENING TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE HOTEL WHILE BARACK WAS ANSWERING HIS.THAT WAS GROSS. RICK WARREN MADE THE OLD FELLOW LOOKED GREAT BUT QUICKLY SARAH PALIN BROUGHT HIM DOWN.                         Face of reason December 17th, 2008 3:02 pm ET      Poeple just relax…. Obama told you all in his speeches that things would be a changin….. and so far he hasn’t lied… he has picked some most interesting people to have stand with him and now  he is proving he is Christian….. thats all….                         sonny c. December 17th, 2008 3:02 pm ET      Attention all Christians:  Where in the Words of Jesus in the Four Gospels, does Jesus, the founder of Christianity, say that homosexuality is a sin?                         karen-phoenix December 17th, 2008 3:02 pm ET      Obama has to pick someone for the invocation. All you people that think Warren is wrong, look beyond the gay and abortion issue. Warren is trying to bring religion out of the dark ages(and I’m Lutheran) and at least start with feeding the poor, helping AIDS patients, help the homeless. Warren may even change on his gay and abortion issues if given a chance. DId all want the POPE?!!!                         Brenda C December 17th, 2008 3:03 pm ET      Great choice Obama.  Sure to upset  the gays and abortionists across the country.   haaaaaahaaaaaaaa                         T December 17th, 2008 3:03 pm ET      Obama’s tolerance towards the intolerant is his best known character flaw.  He still doesn’t get that you can’t build an inclusive society with the help of bigots.                         T_Head December 17th, 2008 3:03 pm ET      President Obama is being the Change he wants to see in all of us. We can coexist just fine people.                         Arkansas Undertaker December 17th, 2008 3:03 pm ET      Lord I cant wait until January 20th.                         Disheartening December 17th, 2008 3:03 pm ET      I reluctantley voted for Obama, but now am feeling the first pang of regret.  This choice is very insulting to gay Americans who are still recovering from the sting of Prop 8 in California and the removal of rights in several other states.   There were so many other choices, to pick someone as divisive as this for this important role on inauguration day is very disheartening and is making me re-evaluate my view of President-Elect Obama.                         Edd December 17th, 2008 3:04 pm ET      Rick Warren!! Really!! So much for supporting the LGBT communtiy.                         Douglas, Los Angeles California December 17th, 2008 3:04 pm ET      I don’t agree with this choice, but I can see where President Elect Obama is trying to get this country together as a people, we have been seperate way to long.  Perhaps one day Mr. Warren will see and understand that being gay, or different, is not a bad thing.  We are all children of God and God does not exclude any of us and we shouldn’t exclude one another.                         Rita December 17th, 2008 3:05 pm ET      Honestly, I am taken by surprise and greatly disappointed by the choice of Rick Warren.  With the many good people that our President-elect could have chosen for this most important moment, he choses someone who does not follow the idea of truly loving and accepting one another.                         Francisco Cardenas December 17th, 2008 3:05 pm ET      Warren did not want to get involved with AIDS because he saw it as a “homosexual disease” … and his support for Prop 8 clearly shows he has no problem legislating religious dogma on those who don’t share his views.  Obama is not making a smart move here at all.  I am sadly disappointed in this choice.                         Cathy Agu December 17th, 2008 3:05 pm ET      Where is J Wright?

WOW GET A LIFE PEOPLE HE IS AN AMERICAN TOO                         JT from Missouri December 17th, 2008 3:06 pm ET      This proves that Obama is willing to accept all religions, no matter if they are for him or against him. He is not willing to hold a grudge against any people. Obama believes in the constitution, and that accounts for the freedom of religion. Obama himself is a Christian.      For all people who are impatient about this Blagoveich scandal, the prosecutor said for Obama to withhold information until next week. Obama is just following orders, which proves he is NOT arrogant.      Obama’s choice is not because he wants to divide America, it is because he is willing to give the guy a chance to help all people come together. Furthermore, John, Obama’s choice for this DOES NOT mean that he is for Military discrimination. I hope you win him back because you losing him because of that choice is, no offense to you, but kind of arrogant to do. God bless the USA and the world.                         Matt December 17th, 2008 3:06 pm ET      Indeed.  What better way to show there’s a separation between church and state than to work people regardless of their religious beliefs?  We have to learn to live with each other somehow people.  We can’t just say “haha, we won” and start snubbing everyone who disagrees with you.  That would be more of the same.                         OBAMABOT? MAYBE NOT! December 17th, 2008 3:06 pm ET      If this move is an effort to bring evangeicals into the Democratic party, good luck.   This may win a few bible thumpers, but lose a whole segment of who thought they had been marginalized into the Republican party!                         LIP December 17th, 2008 3:06 pm ET      Still waiting for the multi ethnic administration that I believe many people thought they would see with Obama President.  After all, the Democrats claim to be the party of the people.  So far George W. Bush has Obama beat hands down.

MADEoff is just another in a line of white collar criminals that the elite from both the Democratic and Republicans have either not regulated, looked the other way, or are in cahoots with.  So mostly the rich got taken by this guy, so what…that’s the way the thunder rumbles.  What is terrible is the trusts and endowments that benefit the underpriviledged are affected…meaning families in need will have to look elsewhere.  When will we start making white collar crimes punishable by death too?…”Blue collar” crimes are, right?  Well, they didn’t kill anybody you say.  I say they do…it not through heart attacks it’s a slow death…from health problems, et al.  Bottom Line: There has to be a better deterrent to white collar crime than large sum fines and half way house country club “prisions” (see Michael Keating, Leona Helmsley, and Martha Stewart, et al).  I say put them with other criminals and/ or executive them for heinous crimes like this.

Rick Warren is not in Obama’s cabnet.  He is speaking at the inauguration.  After all, Obama is a Christian and did say that he believes in marriage between a man and woman.  Although he respects everyone’s choice, Obama still has his own beliefs.     Warren does not represent Obama. Are there any religious people on this blog?  I’m starting to get worried here.  It sounds like a bunch of religious bashers are out here on this blog.                         FreeNLovIt December 17th, 2008 3:10 pm ET      It’s cold in IL.

Those rights aren’t special rights…they would make people equal.  That’s what this country’s founding documents guarantee, so you’re going to have to live with it when us crazy leftist liberals beat your dogmatic religious agenda to a shiny pulp.  It’s “OUR” country, not “YOURS” or “MINE” and it was never the intent of the founding fathers that our government be used as a means of enforcing religious tenets and morality choices.

Matt December 17th, 2008 3:16 pm ET      @ John, Brooklyn   Grow up.  It’s just the invocation, not adoption of the guy’s beliefs.  The only way we’re going to make progress is to work with everyone.  Turning the tables and discriminating against those who you view as discriminating against you is childish nonsense and stops us from moving forward.                         John in Ohio December 17th, 2008 3:16 pm ET      This is another instance of Obama reaching out to the right in a way that will tick off the left. Those on the left like myself who dislike Rick Warren and everything he stands for have to realize that Obama is everybody’s president, and those on the right who criticize Obama for absolutely everything have to realize that he is making a conscious effort to unify the government and the country.                         Andy December 17th, 2008 3:17 pm ET      Great Choice..   I like Rick Warren.

Leadership 101 December 17th, 2008 3:23 pm ET      To all the people who are dissapointed by PE Obama’s selection of Rick Warren to give the invocation; it’s called “Leading by example”. He may not agree with some of Rick Warrens philosphy’s, but he still reached out and included him on the basis of something they do agree on, prayer. Sometimes the best people for jobs are overlooked because of their views or beliefs on unrelated issues and you end up with someone who believes what you believe but can’t do the job you needed them to do (prime example G.W. Bush vs John McCain in the 2000 primaries). So instead of bashing his choice, how about taking a page out of his playbook. Everyone doesn’t agree with everyone on everything the key is to find the common ground. Just a thought…                         melanie December 17th, 2008 3:24 pm ET      I’ve been to Rick Warren’s church - Saddleback, and people don’t seem to know how much social/outreach work they do in rec

Tuesday, December 23, 2008         OBAMA HOLDS THE DOOR AS  RICK WARREN POURS THE WINE         After reading the onslaught of email that has been sent to me since Rick Warren was announced as Obama's choice to deliver the invocation, I have to sound another trumpet blast as the other trumpets are blaring. I have observed many heated blog discussions about the Obama's selection of Rick Warren as the invocation speaker. Many ask:  Why is Obama allowing a range of representatives from the American constituency to participate in the inauguration ceremonies? Why isn't Obama shutting off access to  those who express views that he doesn't support?     They think that shutting out everyone who doesn't think like we do is the wisest political strategy to undertake? Is there a Christian minister in this country who is pro-abortion and pro-life, anti-gay rights and pro-gay rights, pro-gay marriage and anti-gay marriage? Is there another minister Obama should have chosen whose views will appease every group in the nation who voted for him? Why Rick? He was  named  one of ""The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America"" by Time Magazine and has an enormous following worldwide. It was not shocking to me that Obama's advisory team placed Rick on the list of possible invitees. It is often assumed that Rick's core following is the white American conservative Christian. For the last twenty years, Rick Warren has been seeking to build a support base among the black, Latino and Asian moderates in the Christian community. He's made substantial progress on all fronts. His Pastors.com web site provides more free resources than any other ministry web site in the entire country. Rick Warren is  the keynote speaker  at Martin Luther King, Jr. Annual Commemorative Service that is scheduled for January 19, 2009 at Ebenezer Baptist Church and is included in the official program of the ten-day King Center’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration which begins on January 10th. He can put a check mark on his target list for scoring that coup: National media coverage and photos with respected black leaders. Political strategists measure the expected level of support and the level of opposition for every decision announced by the President-Elect. How many gays and lesbians will be outraged? How many Christian progressives will be outraged? How many pro-choice radicals will be outraged? How many women will be outraged? They identify the groups that will be outraged, estimate how long the outrage will last and identify the probable actions that will result from the outraged groups. These political strategists knew that the outrage that would result from Rick Warren's participation would not have a lasting impact on Obama's approval rating.    Political and religious commentators would debate each other on t.v., editorialists would write about the reactions of different segments of Obama's support base, while bloggers would have rant sessions. Meanwhile, there is  no collective strategy  that results in any type of punitive action by any of the outraged groups. These political strategists aren't phased at all by the outcry from the black electorate. Everyone knows that Obama received 80% of the black vote while promising black voters absolutely nothing for their loyalty. Obama's team knows that it doesn't matter if black voters lodge complaints because there is a large segment of the black electorate that will  unconditionally  support Obama's re-election.  Everyone knows the black electorate doesn't have a national strategy in place to hold politicians accountable. Over the last few days, I have read blog discussions in which black bloggers were expressing outrage about the implications of Rick Warren's enhanced global credibility, post-inauguration. They are concerned that world leaders will pay close attention to who has received the endorsement of the new president. Whether Obama wants to admit it or not, we all know that an invitation gives  the perception  of endorsement. The political maneuvering of Rick Warren has reached its zenith as he declares ""checkmate!"" and takes the podium. He's hardly surprised that he has seized center stage. He has been building his platform for  three decades .  The Obama who now answers his critics by saying ""everyone's voice should be heard"" is the same Obama who sternly denounced his own pastor when white people decided that his pastor's views about the U.S. government were offensive, and decided to be offended that blacks at his church focused on the problems of the black community by outlining an agenda. The Obama victory was a case study in how white people are willing to bake, glaze and package cosmetic racial progress - as long as everyone follows  their  rules on  their  game board. Obama distanced himself from the esteemed black spiritual leader whose views intimidated white people - but now Obama says he's ""open to dialogue"" with the esteemed white spiritual leader who offends gays and progressives. What happened to the Obama who distanced himself from anyone whose views were  divisive ? The church and the state are odd bed fellows. Over the years, I have watched how power is being bartered among the spiritual leaders who have a national following. Rather unexpectedly, I was quickly brought into a global ministry conglomerate to work as a papal scribe for a well-connected televangelist. I was not impressed with him and had not paid much attention to his ministry, although I knew that his ministry was operating throughout the world. I quickly learned that this bishop had political connections throughout the world. He has had private dinners with several heads of state in order to give ""spiritual counsel"". He can tap into contacts at The World Bank and the United Nations. The general public doesn't realize how often these televangelists are part of the private conversations in corridors of power.   This summer, I was contacted by a televangelist who asked me to write devotional material for a head-of-state. After I sent it to him, he got on a plane and hand-delivered it. All of this took place away from the media. Do you think this head-of-state won't invite him to a ceremony? These strategic inroads are crafted skillfully. It is clear to me that the church has chosen to have many one-night-stands with the state.  At times, the church is the well-paid and pampered mistress who has no intention of demanding marriage. There are many speculations about which spiritual leader will be the spokesperson for American Christianity.  While other members of the clergy are sitting on the sidelines making speculations, the spiritual leaders who are focused on dominance are well into the implementation of their strategy.   There are many t.v. preachers who hire public relations strategists and political experts. No one takes the political spotlight without a strategy. Rick Warren's invitation to participate was not a fluke. His presidential forum was part of his strategy and was not an idea that popped into his head during the campaign. Read his web site and you'll see that Rick Warren is interested in making sure that his ministry's message has  ""the largest participation"" ,  ""the widest distribution"" ,  ""the longest continuation"" ,  ""the fastest expansion""  and  ""the simplest administration""  (substitute ""shrewdest""). Rick Warren told Ann Curry in a Dateline interview that with one mouse click, he can send a message to 250,000 pastors in 163 countries. The marketing strategy of his conglomerate is astounding. The P.E.A.C.E. plan uses this slogan: ""Ordinary people empowered by God making a difference together wherever they are."" Sounds inclusive, doesn't it?  There are several expansive initiatives that Rick Warren has launched that have had a phenomenal impact on those in need. I believe that the  Purpose-Driven  series that Rick Warren (and others) developed is a tremendous resource to churches.  Rick Warren has not kept his political platform a secret.  I see many global ministry leaders adopting a three-fold strategy:  - a  humanitarian focus ,  - an  apostolic focus , and  - a  political focus .  Why is Rick Warren controversial? Rick Warren is against homosexuality/lesbianism in the body of Christ. He's not hunting down gays and lesbians in society but he would prefer that they join someone else's church. Rick Warren is against gay marriage legislation and believes that marriage is defined as a heterosexual covenant. He is against ""redefinition of marriage"". Rick Warren is against abortion. Rick Warren is against stem cell research. Rick Warren is pro AIDS/HIV advocacy. Rick Warren is pro Africa outreach for humanitarian aid. (It's now in vogue for preachers to openly care about Africa while staying silent about wars financed by U.S. corporations.) Many bloggers have insisted that Rick Warren is not supportive of women in ministerial roles and that he is not supportive of women in church leadership. Someone better tell him that his wife is a woman because she helped him start his church and now leads a global ministry  that he financed . She is publishing books and preaching to crowds all over the world. Her husband mentions her ministry work everywhere he goes. Over a year ago, I sat and listened to a t.v. preacher tell the crowd: ""Overnight my message went into 1,000 countries"". I learned that this happened because of a restructuring of a television network merger. Do you think that the politicians have nothing to do with network mergers? The church and the state make odd bed fellows. At times, I am annoyed when I hear black women complaining about the shenanigans of others who are methodically executing successful (and dubious) strategies.  We fail to shut down the opponents' strategies when they are set in motion...but later we scream about their success. When will we decide to hunt down political weapons before they are unleashed?  Must we always show up late? I have lost count of the number of times that I have heard my ministry colleagues railing against the ""show biz"" preachers who are ""fleecing the flock"".  Just when does that outrage translate into  collective action ?    I don't silence the voices of protest but I silence the ranting and raving that yields  no tangible strategy . Where is the blueprint?  I see many blog rant sessions that continue for days...calls to action announced...and no one in the conversation has introduced a blueprint. I want to invite the participants of this think tank to think about the blueprint that is necessary. It seems that there are so many esteemed members of the black clergy who claim to be so politically-astute and so knowledgeable about the maneuvers of the Religious Right.  I must ask: ""Just how has the Religious Right gained so much ground under your watch?""   I know a CEO who regularly has lunch with members of the media. There are high profile celebrity preachers who have alliances with different media outlets. Do you think that certain people just ""happen"" to be invited to give their opinions on t.v. while others are not? Rick Warren has allies in places that you would not expect. These men who have multi-million ministry conglomerates implement a global strategy and have  public  allies and  invisible  allies. I was told explicitly by a well-known spiritual leader that he viewed me as a ""secret weapon"" in his matrix. There is a huge difference between the expansion of power baseis and the identification of proteges within ministry networks. There is a huge difference between the expansion of power bases and the cultivation of supporters of our ministry. There is a huge difference between the expansion of power bases and the initiation of friendship networks in the ministry. The expansion of power bases usually requires that we engage with our detractors in order to disarm them and establish a bartering system with them. Very few leaders will admit that they engage with their opponents with the intention of bartering power chips. Several months ago, I wrote a post about ""Black Women and The Redefinition of Power"" because too many of us are content to gain access to circles of influence.  We don't strategize for dominance.  Take a look at the black church construct that is financed by black women and controlled by black men. There is not one major black denomination that is led by a woman. Look at the conference agenda of women in ministry conferences.  You probably will not find that there are sessions planned that focus on  tactical strategy  to train women in ministry leadership how to construct blueprints that will enable black women to dominate the most crucial spheres of influence. It is disturbing to me to hear black women crying ""foul!"" every time we are out-maneuvered. We need to master the game board. I am not justifying underhanded tactics and back door strategies, but we need to  proactively plan  to address underhanded tactics and back door strategies.  The expansion of the strategy of Rick Warren requires  deep pockets , even if these ministry leaders want to pretend that they accomplish everything that they do on a shoe-string budget and ""Kumbaya"". What's in the war chest, sistas? This case study of Rick Warren and his march into the White House has many valuable lessons that we can't ignore. Pundit Sarah Posner wrote, ""Obama had thousands of clergy to choose from, and the choice of Warren is not only a slap in the face to progressive ministers toiling on the front lines of advocacy and service but a bow to the continuing influence of the religious right in American politics. Warren vocally opposes gay marriage, does not believe in evolution, has compared abortion to the Holocaust and backed the assassination of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad."" Black women have fought long and hard for inclusion. Many of us have made inclusion the highest goal. Over time, we decided that we wanted  inclusion and equality . We accepted a few convoluted distortions and began to embrace  cosmetic equality  as an acceptable  substitute .  This acceptance of cosmetic equality as a measurement of social progress became a decoy that was used by those who wanted to keep our focus off of  dominance. We were invited to the table. We were happy to see a name tag at the table that validated our sense of belonging. We were grinned at and complimented for the ""progress"" we made by sitting at the table. We accepted pats on the back for being ""symbols"" of  cosmetic equality .  By the time we notice what's happening, the feast is over, the dessert has been served and we are sitting before an empty plate.  Dominance  is the dessert that others savor, that we do not partake of. Many lessons must be grasped as we watch Rick Warren capitalize upon his latest political coup. A most important lesson to begin with: Let's stop showing up late for dinner and complaining that we didn't have any dessert.

I know what  I, as an individual,  want for myself & my loved ones. I don't know what any collectives that I am a member of (AA women, AA Muslim women, Black women in general of all ethnicities & faith traditions, etc.) want. Do Christian Black women even  want  dominance of anything? For example, I've concluded that most of the Muslim Black women I've observed  want to be dominated  by what they perceive to be strong men. We need to ask collectively: Dominance of what? For what purpose? Again, I can answer these questions on an individual level. [I want a dominant market share in the industry niche that I'm entering. I want this so that I can provide financial freedom for myself; and additional income stream opportunities for others. I want this so I can do some large-scale public interest projects.] Clearly knowing what I want helps me streamline & focus my strategy & efforts. Peace, blessings and solidarity.

I love how you lay it down talking about our lack of a strategy to deal with people who are organizing for dominance. I agree. We treat Obama, a centrist politician, more like a savior than another politician we need to push to give regular folks what they deserve. We sorely need a strong, independent, progressive movement comprising all geneders and races to counter this. In structure and policies, it should represent equality toward women, blacks and gays. It should not be attached to that sorry democratic party. And it should not be led by college intellectuals who want to do a lot of talk but no action. It should be led by somebody that's not afraid to speak out, to protest in myriads of ways.  We need a strong independent party headed by someone like Cynthia McKinney.No. Centrist politician will always let us down. Remember what Bill Clinton did to Sista Soldier? Remember how he started NAFTA, agreements that's still causing American jobs to go to Mexico and China?  One day, black women, like the rest of us, are going to wake up and begin to think that we should have been organizing an independent movement like yesterday, BEFORE Obama became president.  Luv u, Sis.          December 23, 2008 11:46 AM                      Miriam  said...      Lisa you are just on fire with this post!  I certainly hope we can-and I can contribute to- finding a way to gain dominance on things related to food, health, healthy eating; because I am extremely wary of the FDA, et al. Also dominance in the media. (including historical and science type info that gets said) Dominance in Statistics. There I shamefully admit to dropping the ball as a Statistics major back in college. And finally a ""know your opponent"" type of understanding, but I am not sure how to express that yet. Perhaps a lesson in ""shrewdness""?

My observation was always met with hostility. I believe that African American unconditional support of Obama and by extension to Democrats is why we collectively have no political power. We have let the Republicans and Democrats play good cop/ bad cop for the last 40 years with us and have not done anything to end their game. Your post gives me a little hope to know that there are some other African Americans who are wise to the game being played on us and won't sit quietly.

December 24, 2008 12:29 PM                      PioneerValleyWoman  said...      I am not one who was shocked at Obama choosing Warren.  I have always seen him as a politician whose mantra under all the public rhetoric is ""expedience"". He does what he has to do to get where he wants to go. It seems as though he has been reading a playbook of Clinton's presidency. In office, I think he will be triangulating like crazy...just like Clinton did while in office. He told everybody what they wanted to hear then did what he thought would get him the most support from the people he had to ""woo,"" the folks who were not going anywhere because they would only vote Democratic. As a result, he was able to get elected twice...I hope Obama will be smarter though, and not get caught in any scandals, contrary to Clinton.          December 24, 2008 2:49 PM                      LISA VAZQUEZ  said...      Welcome Khadija! Thank you for starting off this conversation! You asked: ""Do Christian Black women even want dominance of anything?"" My perception has been that my sistas in the black church construct do not even discuss dominance in ANY sphere of society. From what I am hearing, many of them believe that inclusion an acceptable substitute for influence. Over the years, I have learned that white America doesn't have much problem now with allowing access. Access isn't threatening anymore. It's only threatening if their power bases are being dismantled. You posted a great question to the group: ""We need to ask collectively: Dominance of what? For what purpose?"" I am sure that there will be different responses to that question from different commenters. I doubt that white people ask each other: ""what is the purpose of our race dominating spheres of influence?""  They don't ask that question of each other because it is clear to them. They clearly understand what they stand to gain by maintaining white supremacist constructs. I believe that this is why there have been so many bogus attempts to ""sell"" the notion of cosmetic equality to the black masses. I imagine that it must be quite reassuring for those who have a vested interest in reinforcing white supremacist constructs to take note of how the black masses are content to celebrate symbols of cosmetic equality. I appreciate the substance that you continue to bring to this think tank. This discussion is just warming up so please return often! Peace, blessings and DUNAMIS! Lisa ___________________________________ Welcome MacDaddy! Thank you for stopping by!

Lisa ________________________________ Welcome Miriam! Thanks for adding to this conversation! I want all of us to think about the criteria we use to identify our allies and our adversaries.

Lisa _________________________________ Welcome Monie! Thank you so much for finding my blog! Please feel free to return and comment on previous discussions. We never close any discussion on any post. I am not surprised that you noticed hostility from others when pointing out how we have been bamboozled. There is always hostility and suspicion directed at those who start asking questions that put attention on our accountability. There are a few people who came to this think tank with hostility to hurl in my direction. I sent them packing! They were resentful because the discussions at this think tank required introspection and required the identification of specific accountabilities. You mentioned Obama's campaign strategy. Obama ignored the black electorate just as dutifully as any other politician would have. In my opinion, Obama's approach with the black electorate was  a total farce  because he coasted along on the emotionalism of symbolism in order to have the support of black voters. At this point, I do not see an extraordinary leader in Obama. Many have decided that he is and we really have no proof of that. I see that he is purposeful, but that does not make him extraordinary. Peace, blessings and DUNAMIS! Lisa _________________________________ Welcome Pastor! Thank you for sharing your thoughts! I hope that you will share your with insights with the group about: 1 - how Rick Warren has been an ""enemy"" to the black community 2 - how Rick Warren has been an ""enemy"" to the black church 3 - what has substantiated those accusations  I am assuming that you believe he is an ""enemy"", and if this is an erroneous assumption, then  pleeease accept my apologies . I was reading an article this morning in which Rick Warren was being accused by white progressives of being hypocritical because he said he loves gays and lesbians. They decided that it is hypocritical for him to say he loves gays and lesbians while teaching that God condemns homosexuality and lesbianism.  I fail to see where there is hypocrisy in that because it is possible for a Christian to love all humanity and still teach about God's condemnation.  God loves but God also condemns. Peace, blessings and DUNAMIS! Lisa ___________________________________ Welcome (Rev.) Pioneer Valley Woman! Thanks for joining in this conversation! The masses seem to have convinced themselves that Obama is going to be such a moral leader for our time. I don't cling to those fantasies.  I believe that he's willing to barter, break promises and cut deals. Time will tell. I have a few other comments that I want to put on the table for further consideration. 1 - I hear the screams of protest from many black bloggers about Rick Warren, but I believe that those screams are a bit hollow. Most black people should recognize by now that our community is anti-homosexuality and anti-lesbian.  I will invite any lesbian or homosexual person who reads this blog confirm my observation. It is no secret to any of us that it is perfectly acceptable to reject homosexuals and lesbians in the black community. 2 - There is nothing wrong with Rick Warren stating that he is against gay marriage. Obama is against gay marriage and has said that he supports civil unions. Obama defines marriage the same way that Rick Warren does. There is nothing wrong with Rick Warren stating that he believes God condemns homosexuality and lesbianism. The Religious Right supports that view and a huge segment of the black church does too!  A few months ago, I found that one blogger was shocked to learn that I believe homosexuality/lesbianism is a sin. I am not sure why that was a shocker.  I don't believe that anyone has to think as I do or live as I do in order to have my friendship. 3 - Rick Warren is against abortion and the black church doesn't even talk about abortion! The black church certainly has not been carrying the pro-choice banner! Black women in church won't even admit they have had abortions! They aren't ashamed of having children out of wedlock, but abortion is shameful and a secret to carry to the grave. There are twice as many black babies being aborted than there are black babies being born. We don't mention abortion statistics in the black church construct.  My problem with Rick Warren is not that he has openly touted his belief that God condemns homosexuality and lesbianism. That belief is not so rare in the Christian community. My problem is with the manner in which he has framed his positions for public consumption. Preachers need to think very carefully about how they are framing these issues.  Rick Warren has forged alliances with persons who are not viewed as allies of blacks. In my mind, this does not mean that Rick Warren becomes an ""enemy"" by association. I honestly believe that establishing those types of sweeping conclusions is a grave mistake. I would need to know the purpose of the alliance before I would make that determination. I have created associations with people whose ideologies I will not embrace. I don't support the doctrine of the Nation of Islam, and I don't support the history of their subjugation of women.  I would still work with members of the Nation of Islam on common objectives that benefit our people. Unlike many Christian clergymen, I wouldn't be secretive about working with them either. I was happy to see that Dr. Wright has publicly acknowledged Louis Farrakhan as a friend. The ridiculous assumption that white America wanted to toss up in our faces is that friendships signify an acceptance of common ideologies. That's not true. I have friends who do not share my spiritual beliefs, political beliefs or cultural beliefs. I don't think Louis Farrakhan is anti-semetic. He made anti-semetic statements years ago. Unlike many others, I don't take the statements of public figures and put them in a time capsule. People who do this assume that people will never change their ideologies or positions on anything. I don't embrace that mindset. Listening to audio tape of statements that Farrakhan made years ago is not evidence that he embraces those same perspectives right now. I am interested in hearing your take on this. Peace, blessings and DUNAMIS! Lisa          December 24, 2008 5:48 PM                      [Emeritus]  said...

Greetings Lisa, ""Church and state are odd bed fellows,"" indeed:) I, like Khadija, will need to meditate on this subject some more. But, you have certainly provided a lot of insight for me.  My mother, yesterday while riding along in her car, gave me an ear full about Obama having chosen Rick Warren. I will definitely forward your commentary to her.  It is imperative that we (women, people, African Americans) cease wasting time fussing and complaining about unjust politics, thinking that we are appropriately addressing the problem. Whining is all but productive. Our time is better spent providing solutions.  You're right, early assessment is key. Injustice must be counteracted (shut down) far before it has any  impact. Coming along after the fact is pointless.  Thank you, Lisa. I am honored and delighted to have been added to your blogroll. I am truly enjoying  this site. It is such a valuable resource. I am definitely adding you to my list as well. ~Peace & Blessings to you this glorious holiday season.          December 24, 2008 7:02 PM                      Octogalore  said...      Hi Lisa!

Hey there, I've got to say that I was a bit wary of President-Elect Obama when I discovered he was pro-choice and pro-death penalty. As a pro-life Christian I wanted a black president who would understand what Martin Luther King's niece and daughter have told us about the genocidal and soul-killing nature of abortions in black communities. Hey, I'm for legal abortion but morally, it's totally wrong. I had also wanted a president who I could count on to stop executions of retarded black male and female prisoners or folks who were probably innocent but railroaded by a racist penal system. But that didn't happen either.  Yet, I have to say I was impressed when I saw his cabinet picks. He is showing all Americans what we black folks have always known...that we are a fair-minded people who see all men as brothers. As for Rick Warren, I'm pro gay civil ceremonies but against gay marriage. I know my radical gay friends well enough to know that many of them are totally aimed toward destroying the church and the Bible and there's a war on to bring down any church that doesn't tow the gay line. I'm all for civil rights but I hate bullying that wants to force folks to give up the religious views they inherited from their spiritual ancestors.

We know what Warren does.  He was part of the Prop 8 support that made sure that gay married people in California are no longer married.  He has compared gay marriages to pedophila and incest.  Now I am seeing Obama's actions.  The actions are beginning to be very different than his words.  I am now paying attention.  He is selling one segment down the river to appease the same segment  "

Rick Warren Quote                       If you're alive,            there's a purpose for your life.             Rick Warren Quote            And you know,            when you've experienced grace and you feel like you've been forgiven,            you're a lot more forgiving of other people. You're a lot more gracious            to others.             Rick Warren Quote           When people lack            hope, they do hopeless things.             Rick Warren Quote           God uses normal            ordinary people in daily life. And if God only used perfect people,            nothing would get done. Because none of us are perfect.              Rick Warren Quote           And I think the            other thing is, that opportunities are all around us, but a lot of times            we're just unaware of it. Everybody wants to serve God in a great way.             Rick Warren Quote           I believe that            the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence.            And fame is not for our own benefit, or notoriety is not for our own            benefit, it's for leverage to do good.

The Last Supper has been the subject of many paintings, perhaps  the most famous  by  Leonardo da Vinci .   According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". Other events and dialogue are recorded in the  Synoptic Gospels  and the  Gospel of John . Many Christians describe this as the ""Institution of the  Eucharist "" (see  Maundy Thursday ).   The vessel which was used to serve the wine is sometimes called the  Holy Chalice , and has been the one of the supposed subjects of  Holy Grail  literature in  Christian mythology .

He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location       Main article:  Cenacle       According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances       Main article:  Maundy Thursday              The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape       Main article:  Agape feast               Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

The question came up before the Saddleback Forum, where U.S. Senator and GOP Nominee for President John McCain did say that he regretted how he treated his first wife.

I do not agree completely with Rick Warren, but I love his attempt to make the world a better place. In a way Rick Warren is a pre-millenialist who acts and lives like a post-millenialist. I happen to be a postmillenialist, preterist who believes God can and will turn this world around through His church. I despise the way most Christian bank upon the world getting worse and worse. I believe The Left Behind theory is pure poison and unbiblical. I see premillenialism as a very negative view point that makes God out to be a loser.

There are villages that have little else,                        but they do have a church.                        Rick Warren                        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                       The Church is the most magnificent concept ever created. It has survived persistent abuse, horrifying persecution, and widespread neglect. Yet despite its faults (due to our sinfulness), it is still God’s chosen instrument of blessing and has been for 2,000 years.                       The Church will last for eternity, and because it is God’s instrument for ministry here on Earth, it is truly the greatest force on the face of the Earth. That’s why I believe tackling the world’s biggest problems – the giants of spiritual lostness, egocentric leadership, poverty, disease, and ignorance – can only be done through the Church.                        The Church has eight distinct advantages over the efforts of business and government:                       1. The Church provides for the largest participation.                          Most people have no idea how many Christians there are in the world: More than 2 billion people claim to be followers of Jesus Christ. That’s one third of the world’s population! The Church has about a billion more people than the entire nation of China.                        For example, about 100 million people in the United States went to church this past weekend. That’s more people than will attend sporting events in the United States throughout this year. The Church is the largest force for good in the world. Nothing else even comes close.                       2. The Church provides for the widest distribution.                          The Church is everywhere in the world. There are villages that have little else, but they do have a church. You could visit millions of villages around the world that don’t have a school, a clinic, a hospital, a fire department, or a post office. They don’t have any businesses. But they do have a church. The Church is more widely spread – more widely distributed – than any business franchise in the world.                       Consider this: The Red Cross noted that 90 percent of the meals they served to victims of Hurricane Katrina were actually cooked by Southern Baptist churches. Many churches were able to jump into action faster than the government agencies or the Red Cross. Why? The Church is literally everywhere, and Christians who could provide help to the Gulf Coast communicated with Christians in need of help so relief could be sent immediately.                       3. The Church provides the longest continuation.                        The Church has been around for 2,000 years. We’re not a fly-by-night operation. The Church has a track record that spans centuries: Malicious leaders have tried to destroy it, hostile groups have persecuted it, and skeptics have scoffed at it. Nevertheless, God’s Church is bigger now than ever before in history.                        Why? Because it’s the Church that Jesus established, and it is indestructible. The Bible calls the Church an unshakable kingdom. In Matthew 16, Jesus says, “I will build my Church and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.” All the powers of hell – in other words, no hurricane, no earthquake, no tsunami, no famine, no pandemic, no army will ever conquer the Church established by Jesus Christ.                       4. The Church provides the fastest expansion.                        Did you know that every day 60,000 new people come to believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior? By the end of today, thousands of new churches will be started throughout the world, and that will happen tomorrow and the next day and the next.                       In one country that is closed to traditional Christian missions, more than 60,000 house churches have been started in one province by the work of lay people, no different from the people who fill your church sanctuary every weekend.                                             --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                         If you’ve got a problem that’s growing at                         a rapid rate, then you need a solution                         that will grow even more rapidly.                        For                        instance, HIV/AIDS is growing at an                        incredibly fast rate in the world.                       Yet                        thank God, the Church is outgrowing                        the                       disease,so more and more believers                        can help minister to those with HIV/AIDS.                        Rick Warren                        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                       Why is fast expansion important? If you’ve got a problem that’s growing at a rapid rate, then you need a solution that will grow even more rapidly. For instance, HIV/AIDS is growing at an incredibly fast rate in the world. Yet thank God the Church is outgrowing the disease, so more and more believers can help minister to those with HIV/AIDS.                       If we’re going to tackle global giants like poverty, disease, or illiteracy, then we must be part of something that’s growing faster than the problem. The Church is doing just that!                       5. The Church provides the highest motivation.                        Why do any of us do what we do in ministry? It’s not to make money, not to make a name for ourselves and not for duty to our nation. We do it out of love. Jesus stated it as the Great Commandment: “Love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself.” We wouldn’t do the hard work required to tackle these global giants for money, for fame, or for anything else. It just wouldn’t be worth it; we’d quit before the end.                        We’re motivated to keep at the hard work of ministry because we love God, and our love for God compels us to love other people. It is love that never gives up; it is love that keeps moving forward despite the appearance of impossible odds; and it is love that outlasts any problem.                       6. The Church provides the strongest authorization.                        God authorized the Church to take on global giants, such as spiritual lostness, egocentric leadership, poverty, disease, and ignorance. With God’s authorization, the outcome is guaranteed to be successful.                       When you know that God has authorized you to do something, you don’t worry about failure because God doesn’t sponsor flops. If God says we’re going to do it, it’s going to happen. It is inevitable. In fact, the Bible teaches that God will give us his power to complete the task. This is God’s way - ordinary people empowered by his Spirit.                       7. The Church provides the simplest administration.                        The Church is organized in such a way that we can network faster and with less bureaucracy than most governmental agencies or even well-meaning charities. For instance, the organizational structure at Saddleback, which is based on the New Testament model, holds that every member is a minister. Each person in our church family is encouraged to use his or her own S.H.A.P.E. (Spiritual gifts, Heart, Abilities, Personality, Experiences) to do what God has called him or her to do. There is no bureaucracy or hierarchy. There isn’t a single committee, and the process doesn’t require a long list of approvals.                        The old wineskin of command and control won’t work well in the 21st century. The organization of the future is the “network.” And there’s no better worldwide network than the Church, where every member is a minister and empowered to do what God wants done.

Check out Purpose Driven Ministries’ P.E.A.C.E. Plan Web site.                         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                       Consider it this way – tens of millions of Christians in millions of small groups that are part of churches around the world can take on the global giants with no other authority than that given from Jesus Christ. In other words, we have God’s permission and we have God’s command to do it. There is no need to seek permission from anyone else.                       8. The Church provides for God’s conclusion.                        Since we believe the Bible is God’s Word, we already know the end of history. Jesus said in Matthew 24: “The good news about God’s Kingdom will be preached in all the world to every nation, and then the end will come.” It is inevitable and unavoidable.                       When you consider these eight advantages, think about the exponential explosion of ministry when millions upon millions of small groups in millions upon millions of churches organize in such a way that each person can do their part in attacking the five global giants.                       What do you think could happen if God’s people prayed against these global giants, prepared for action against these giants, and then moved through faith to tackle these giants?                       We may look at these problems and think, “These are too big! How could we possibly solve them?”                        But with God, nothing is impossible – and if we all work together as his Church, we’ll see these giants falls just as Goliath fell when faced with David’s obedience to God.                       Pastor, it is a great privilege and an awesome responsibility to lead a local church. God wouldn’t have placed you where you are if he didn’t believe you could handle the task before you. You play a vital role in tackling these global giants.

clueweb09-enwp00-99-21690	"                     Last Supper          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Last supper )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          For other uses, see  The Last Supper (disambiguation) .           The Last Supper  ( Convent of Sta. Maria delle Grazie ,  Milan ,  Italy  (1498), by  Leonardo da Vinci ).       In the Christian  Gospels , the  Last Supper  (also called the  Lord's Supper  or  Mystical Supper ) was the last meal  Jesus  shared with his  Twelve Apostles  and  disciples  before  his death . The Last Supper has been the subject of many paintings, perhaps  the most famous  by  Leonardo da Vinci .   According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". Other events and dialogue are recorded in the  Synoptic Gospels  and the  Gospel of John . Many Christians describe this as the ""Institution of the  Eucharist "" (see  Maundy Thursday ).   The vessel which was used to serve the wine is sometimes called the  Holy Chalice , and has been the one of the supposed subjects of  Holy Grail  literature in  Christian mythology .

Paul the Apostle was the first to write of the Last Supper. He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location       Main article:  Cenacle       According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances       Main article:  Maundy Thursday              The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape       Main article:  Agape feast               Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

The Last Supper has been the subject of many paintings, perhaps  the most famous  by  Leonardo da Vinci .   According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". Other events and dialogue are recorded in the  Synoptic Gospels  and the  Gospel of John . Many Christians describe this as the ""Institution of the  Eucharist "" (see  Maundy Thursday ).   The vessel which was used to serve the wine is sometimes called the  Holy Chalice , and has been the one of the supposed subjects of  Holy Grail  literature in  Christian mythology .

He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location       Main article:  Cenacle       According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances       Main article:  Maundy Thursday              The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape       Main article:  Agape feast               Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

The book has been on the  New York Times  Best Seller list  for advice books for one of the longest periods in history, while also becoming arguably one of the best-selling  non-fiction  books of all time, topping the  Wall Street Journal  best seller charts as well as  Publishers Weekly  charts with over 30 million copies in print by 2006. [ 1 ]   The book offers readers a 40-day personal spiritual journey, and presents what Warren says are  God 's five purposes for  human  life on  Earth  and describes itself as ""a  blueprint  for Christian living in the 21st Century ... using over 1200  Biblical  verses and quotes to challenge the conventional definitions of  Christian Worship ,  Fellowship ,  Discipleship ,  Christian Ministry  and  Evangelism .""

Each chapter contains a personal application section at the end with a ""point to ponder,"" a verse to remember, and a question to consider over the course of that day. Rick Warren described his book as an ""anti-self-help book."" The first sentence of the book reads, ""It's not about you,"" [ 2 ]  and the remainder of the chapter goes on to explain how the quest for personal fulfillment, satisfaction, and meaning can only be found in understanding and doing what God placed you on Earth to do. [ 3 ]  The book's 40 chapters are divided into six major sections, with the following titles: [ 4 ]     What on Earth Am I Here For?   Purpose #1: You Were Planned for God's Pleasure (Worship)   Purpose #2: You Were Formed for God's Family (Fellowship)   Purpose #3: You Were Created to Become Like Christ (Discipleship)   Purpose #4: You Were Shaped for Serving God (Ministry)   Purpose #5: You Were Made for a Mission (Mission)       [ edit ]   Impact   Since September 2002, over 30,000  congregations ,  corporations , and  sports  teams across the  United States  have participated in a ""40 Days of Purpose"" emphasis. [ citation needed ]  A May 2005 survey of American pastors and ministers conducted by  George Barna  asked Christian leaders to identify what books were the most influential on their lives and ministries. The  Purpose Driven Life  was the most frequent response.  The Purpose Driven Church , Warren's previous book, was the second most frequent response. [ 5 ]   Billy Graham  described the book as one that would ""guide you to greatness- through living the Great Commandment and the  Great Commission  of  Jesus ."" The book has been widely cited as being in the tradition of  Oswald Chambers ' devotional guide decades earlier. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Criticism   A Lutheran perspective is that Warren fails to present the evangelical Christian gospel accurately--failing to accurately represent the nature of  sin , repentance and hell, as well as the blood sacrifice of God's son  Jesus  as the means to be forgiven by God for sins and which allows man to have a relationship with God. [ 6 ]  Warren has been accused of absolving his readers of moral responsibility by making Satan into an all-pervasive godlike figure contrary to both orthodox theology and psychological soundness. [ 7 ]  It has been suggested that when citing Scripture, Warren jumps from one Bible version to another, cherry-picking whichever paraphrase or translation supports whatever point he attempts to convey, [ 8 ]  although the practice of using translations selectively has been defended.

The Last Supper has been the subject of many paintings, perhaps  the most famous  by  Leonardo da Vinci .   According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". Other events and dialogue are recorded in the  Synoptic Gospels  and the  Gospel of John . Many Christians describe this as the ""Institution of the  Eucharist "" (see  Maundy Thursday ).   The vessel which was used to serve the wine is sometimes called the  Holy Chalice , and has been the one of the supposed subjects of  Holy Grail  literature in  Christian mythology .

He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Main article:  Cenacle   According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances   Main article:  Maundy Thursday          The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape   Main article:  Agape feast           Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

The book has been widely cited as being in the tradition of  Oswald Chambers ' devotional guide decades earlier. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Criticism   A Lutheran perspective is that Warren fails to present the evangelical Christian gospel accurately--failing to accurately represent the nature of  sin , repentance and hell, as well as the blood sacrifice of God's son  Jesus  as the means to be forgiven by God for sins and which allows man to have a relationship with God. [ 6 ]  Warren has been accused of absolving his readers of moral responsibility by making Satan into an all-pervasive godlike figure contrary to both orthodox theology and psychological soundness. [ 7 ]  It has been suggested that when citing Scripture, Warren jumps from one Bible version to another, cherry-picking whichever paraphrase or translation supports whatever point he attempts to convey, [ 8 ]  although the practice of using translations selectively has been defended. [ 9 ]  Warren's statement that ""Whenever God wanted to prepare someone for his purposes, he took forty days"" [ 10 ]  has been criticized as both overly broad and contradicted by Scripture. [ 11 ]  Warren has also been accused of rejecting rational criticism of religion and asserting that morality derives exclusively from religion.

Smith admitted in her memoirs that she had also pacified her captor with  crystal methamphetamine . [ 13 ]  Smith says Nichols had her bound on her bed with masking tape and an extension cord. Smith says in her book that as the night wore on she tried and succeeded in winning Nichols trust by talking about her faith in God and relating to him her personal stories.

According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"".

He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Main article:  Cenacle   According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances   Main article:  Maundy Thursday          The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape   Main article:  Agape feast           Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Main article:  Cenacle   According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances   Main article:  Maundy Thursday          The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape   Main article:  Agape feast           Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

Zebulon, Holland, and the   Elders of Cush  2. Cush and the  Diamond  3. The  Rivers of Cush , Reuben, Gad, and half-Menasseh  4. Reuben, Gad, and the  Huegonots .  5. South Africa and  Naphtali  6.  Gog  7. A  Solution  for South Africa?    1 . Zebulon, Holland, and the  Elders of Cush  Brit-Am in general terms  relates to South Africa as part of Joseph specifically Ephraim but with Israelites from other Tribes amongst its population. A Bible Code examination on a simple level produced results that in part confirmed previous Brit-Am understanding while opening up additional possibilities. We entered South Africa in the Codes and received no results. South Africa however is part of Africa. The early European settlers of South Africa were Huegeonots from France, Germany, and especially Holland. In our Brit-Am Biblical Codes study of Holland we found a connection between Holland, the Israelite Tribe of Zebulon, and the  ELDERS OF CUSH  which we understood to refer to the early ""Boer"" pioneers of  South Africa.          2 . Cush and the Diamond                  Cush means Africa in general. We could not find anything specific for South Africa BUT South Africa is in Africa (""Cush"" in Hebrew though in some cases ""Cush"" may also refer to India and other regions) and does produce diamonds.  The diamond (Yahalom in Hebrew) was the precious stone representing the Tribe of Zebulon in the Breastplate of the High Priest in the Temple Service (Exodus 28:18). If we therefore were to find combinations indicating  CUSH  (Africa) and  YaHaLOM  (diamond) overlapping each other they could be significant concerning South Africa since South Africa is the major candidiate to which they could refer.   We entered both words and sought the nearest sequences.  This matrix is from a reverse sequence of 6 for  CUSH  and of 15 for  YaHaLOM  (diamond) with the two sequencesoverlapping each other. The word  YaHaLOM  begins with the  Y  in the name of God in the Book of Isaiah 10:23 and works backwards going upwards at a diagonal and around at intervals of 15. In its journal it encounters and intersects (together with  CUSH  words saying twice  THE REMNANT SHALL RETURN .  These are the verses the word  YaHaLOM  intersects:   [Isaiah 10:21]  THE REMNANT SHALL RETURN , EVEN THE REMNANT OF  JACOB , UNTO THE MIGHTY GOD.      [Isaiah 10:22] FOR THOUGH THY PEOPLE  ISRAEL  BE AS THE SAND OF THE SEA, YET A  REMNANT SHALL RETURN : THE CONSUMPTION DECREED SHALL OVERFLOW WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS.           South Africa and Diamonds  http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/diamonds/africa.html   Extracts:    The story of diamonds in South Africa begins between December 1866 and February 1867, when 15-year-old Erasmus Jacobs found a transparent stone on his father's farm, on the south bank of the Orange River. Over the next 15 years, South Africa yielded more diamonds than India had in over 2,000 years. This great outpouring of diamonds coincided with depletion of Brazilian deposits and with a great rise in wealth, particularly in the United States, that ensured diamond prices did not fall as they did when Brazil outproduced diamond demand in the 1730s.    In the 1870s and 1880s Kimberley, encompassing the mines that produced 95% of the world's diamonds, was home to great wealth and fierce rivalries, most notably that between Rhodes and Barnato, English immigrants who consolidated early 31-foot-square prospects into ever larger holdings and mining companies. In 1888, Rhodes prevailed and merged the holdings of both men into De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., a company that is still synonymous with diamonds. Today South Africa is third in production in terms of value and is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future.     Gold and Diamonds http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/66.htm Extracts:    South Africa's modern history has often been dated from the first commercial mining of diamonds and gold in the 1870s and the 1880s, when the region became a magnet for European investment. Mining in the region predated European arrivals by several centuries... Iron mining and smelting sites in the northeast were used as much as 1,700 years ago; copper was mined south of the Limpopo River more than 1,000 years ago; and historians describe early mining activities in the Witwatersrand (literally, ""Ridge of White Waters"" in Afrikaans, commonly shortened to Rand) area, which attracted miners from elsewhere in Africa as early as the thirteenth century.   Soon after the European rush for gold and diamonds in the late nineteenth century, mining operations expanded to include more than two dozen other minerals. By the mid-twentieth century, South Africa was the world's largest producer or second largest producer of gold, diamonds, platinum, chromium, manganese, and vanadium; and it ranked high among producers of coal, iron ore, uranium, copper, silver, fluorspar, asbestos, and limestone.   Clusters of minerals occur in five major mineral complexes--the Bushveld, Transvaal, Witwatersrand, Northern Cape, and Western Cape complexes.   Despite its importance in export revenues, the mining industry contributes only about 9.6 percent of GDP in the mid-1990s, down from an average of nearly 15 percent during the 1980s. The mining sector had been gradually surpassed by manufacturing and financial services both in terms of national output and labor force participation. The mines still account for a greater share of export revenues than any other single economic activity in the 1990s.   Gold, first mined by Europeans in 1886 near Johannesburg, soon became the most important sector in the mining industry. South Africa has almost one-half of the world's known gold reserves, located primarily in the Rand in what was once a prehistoric lake. Gold is also mined in the Free State. Industry analysts estimated in the early 1990s that South Africa had produced more than 43,000 tons of gold in the past century, and that at least that amount remained in reserves.   ...the [gold] industry has consistently earned high profits and has accounted for one-third to one-half of the world's gold production in the 1980s and 1990s.    Diamonds and Platinum   South Africa's diamond mining industry dates back to 1867, when diamonds were discovered near Kimberley, now in the Northern Cape. The Kimberley diamond fields, and later discoveries in Gauteng, the Free State, and along the Atlantic coast, emerged as major sources of gem-quality diamonds, securing South Africa's position as the world's leading producer in the mid-twentieth century. (Rough diamonds were produced in larger quantities in Australia, Zaire, Botswana, and Russia.)   [i.e. South Africa remains the leading producer of gem quality diamonds as distinct from industrial quality].    South Africa is the world's leading producer of platinum. Its output of about ninety tons in 1993 accounted for almost 49 percent of world production.                  3 .  The Rivers of Cush, Reuben, Gad, and half-Menasseh              In Prophecy we identified South Africa with the Israelite entity ""Beyond the Rivers of Cush"".  See  Brit-Am Answers to Queries:  South Africa  Q. 1. What do the Prophets say of South Africa and the Boers?  The above matrix is based on  THE RIVERS OF CUSH  that appears at intervals of  467 going backwards.   At the top, close to the matrix we find the verse:    ONLY THE GOLD, AND THE SILVER, THE BRASS, THE IRON, THE TIN, AND THE LEAD  [Numbers 31:22].                         South Africa has produced and still produces a good proportion of the gold in the world. It also produces quanities of the metals listed above as well as other minerals some of which in Biblical terminology may be included in the names given above since they belong to the same categories.  Gold was important to South Africa not opnly for its economical importance. Historically, gold brought a flood of immigrants from the nations of Joseph to South Africa lead to wars with the Boers and ultimately to British domination over the whole country.    The matrix intersects the verses and especially the highlighted words below:  [Numbers 32:33] AND MOSES GAVE UNTO THEM, EVEN TO  THE CHILDREN OF GAD, AND TO THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN, AND UNTO HALF THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH  THE SON OF JOSEPH, THE KINGDOM OF SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES, AND THE KINGDOM OF OG KING OF BASHAN, THE LAND, WITH THE CITIES THEREOF IN THE COASTS, EVEN THE CITIES OF THE COUNTRY ROUND ABOUT.       [Numbers 33:1] THESE ARE THE JOURNEYS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, WHICH WENT FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT WITH THEIR ARMIES UNDER THE HAND OF  MOSES AND AARON .                 4 .  Reuben, Gad, and the Huegenots                                                   The matrix begins at Leviticus 27:19 and continues to Numbers 1:24 with a reversed sequence of 244.  We saw in the previous example above how the  THE RIVERS OF CUSH  were intersected by  THE CHILDREN OF GAD, AND TO THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN, AND UNTO HALF THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH .   In this example  we find  THE RIVERS OF CUSH  intersected by  THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  with  THE TRIBE OF GAD   below meaning here at the beginning since the name goes backwards. On the next line down we find the expression  FOR THE CHILDREN OF ZEBULON . The association with  ZEBULON  is obvious since the Boers came predominantly from the Netherlands. The Boers however were also mainly Huegenots the forefathers of whom had fled from France to Holland. France is dominated by Reuben but also contains contingents from Gad and Manasseh. This is explained in "" The Tribes "" where we also suggest a special connection between the Gothic Hugeonots and the Israelite tribe of Gad that included the clan of Chaggi or Haggi (Numbers 26:15).    The Boers had similar characteristics to the  THE CHILDREN OF GAD, AND TO THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN, AND UNTO HALF THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH  who according to Scripture had great flocks of sheep and cattle and preferred the open pasture spaces east of the Jordan to the more built up regions west of it (Numbers 32:1-5). So too, the Boers were farmers and grazers. They preferred the wide open spaces. It was said that if a Boer farmer could see the smoke from the chimney of his neighbor on the horizon he would begin to feel crowded and plan to move on. The Boers resented the mainly English-speaking immigrants who came looking for gold and stayed to settle in the towns. A Boer leader is quoted as saying, ""God put gold in the ground, let it stay there"".            5 .   South Africa and Naphtali               Cush (""Africa"") and Drom (""South"") were placed separately in the Bible Codes search Engines and the nearest distance between the two was sought. The first two answers dealt with eschatalogical matters and this was the third finding with a distance of 516 letters between the two words. This example concerns Israelite Tribal Identification which is what interests us here. The first word (""Drom"") is found in Deuteronomy 33:23 and the second (Cush)  in Deuteronomy 34:4.  It begins with,  [Deuteronomy 33:23] AND OF NAPHTALI HE SAID, O NAPHTALI, SATISFIED WITH FAVOUR, AND FULL WITH THE BLESSING OF THE LORD: POSSESS THOU THE WEST AND  THE SOUTH  [Hebrew:  DeROM ].  and ends with,   [Deuteronomy 34:4] AND THE LORD SAID UNTO HIM, THIS IS THE LAND WHICH I SWARE UNTO ABRAHAM, UNTO   ISAAC, AND UNTO JACOB, SAYING, I WILL GIVE IT UNTO THY SEED: I HAVE CAUSED THEE TO SEE IT WITH THINE  EYES, BUT THOU SHALT NOT GO OVER THITHER. In the original text the word order of the end part is:  SEE IT WITH THINE  EYES, BUT THITHER THOU SHALT NOT GO OVER  of this phrase the emphasized words are:   SEE IT [ WITH THINE  EYES, BUT THITHER  [Hebrew: ""be-Ayne C-VeSh aMaH"" with the colored letters in Hebrew spelling "" CUSH ""] THOU SHALT NOT GO OVER     Concerning the first words it is interesting what we wrote in "" The Tribes "" in our caption to the former Coat-of-Arms of the Republic of South Africa:  SOUTH AFRICA: JOSEPH-NAPHTALI-ZEBULON   South Africa was colonized mainly by people of British and Dutch descent with others in addition to the presence of several different African nations. The white peoples are those who (in this case) belong to Israel. The Coat of Arms features a lion (from Joseph -Britain), and two deer (a springbox and oryx). The Deer was a symbol of Naphtali of whom it  was prophesied that he would be greatly blessed and receive the ""west and  the south "" (Deuteronomy 34:23).   We identified Naphtali with elements who settled in Norway including the Naphtalite Huns. In Viking times a migration from Norway to parts of Scotland and Northern Enlgand and Ireland took place. In addition new evidence indicates the presence of elements from Naphtali amongst the so-called ""Celtic"" peoples of Britain espoecially in Wales. It could be that all these different elements contributed to the ""Anglo-Saxon"" settlements in South Africa thus fulfilling the expression of Naphtali inheriting the ""west and  the south "" (Deuteronomy 34:23).            6 .   Gog                  This is taken Ezekiel 39:6 to 38:22 at a reverse interval of 65. The passage speaks about the war of  GOG  and Magog.  We should remember that while we identify the Boers and ""Anglos"" of South Africa as  basically of Israelite origin other elements also exist. In the case of South Africa these ""other"" non-Israelite elements have come to the fore on several occasions and should be recognized for who they are. Brit-Am has established   Criteria  for determining who belongs to Israel and who does not and anyone who is anti-Jewish is suspect of not belonging.  In the matrix above  THE RIVERS OF CUSH  intersect  FROM THE THIGHS [peninsulas] OF THE NORTH  (translated in the KJ as "" OF THE NORTH QUARTERS "" (Ezekiel 38:6) and the Israelite settlers of South Africa did arrive from such regions. After that we have an intersection with  MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL  and further down  CITIES OF ISRAEL . We also find the  NAMES OF GOD  intersecting the beginning and close by which along with other signs emphasizes the deep religious nature and spiritual potential that the Hebrews of South Africa possess.           7 .   A Solution for South Africa?             This appears to be the last Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS) in the Bible forming the combination   RIVERS OF CUSH .  It is a reverse sequence of 720.  It is derived from 1-Kings 12:8 onwards which speaks of the DIVISION between Judah and Israel, how Judah made  REHOBOAM THEIR KING  and how the  WIFE OFJEROBOAM  went to seek advice from the Prophet concerning her son. The sequence starts with Rehoboam rejecting  THE ADVICE OF THE ELDERS . We saw above the link to  THE ELDERS OF CUSH  who in turn are linked to THE ELDERS OF THE CITY in Israel.  It could be that the Israelites of South Africa should draw closer both to their own spiritual past heritage bequeathed to them by their ELDERS as well as endeavoring to heal the breach between Joseph and Judah?

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist upon the institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer. while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled. The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.  The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyrranny over her. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise.  He has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which she had no voice.  He has withheld from her rights which are given to the most ignorant and degraded men--both natives and foreigners.  Having deprived her of this first right of a citizedn, the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.  He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.  He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns.  He has made her, morally, an irresponsible being, as she can commit many crimes with impunity, provided they be done in the presence of her husband. In the covenant of marriage, she is compelled to promise obedience to her husband, he becoming, to all intents and purposes, her master--the law giving him power to deprive her of her liberty, and to administer chastisement. He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the proper causes, and in case of separation, to whom the guardianship of the children shall be given, as to be wholly regardles of the happiness of women -- the law, in all cases, going upon a flase supposition of the supremacy of man, and giving all power into his hands.  After depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if single, and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support a government which recognizes her only when her property can be made profitable to it.  He has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments, and from those she is permitted to follow, she receives but a scanty remuneration. He closes against her all the avenues to wealth and distinction which he considers most homorable to himself. As a teacher of theoloy, medicine, or law, she is not known.  He has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education, all colleges being closed against her.  He allows her in church, as well as state, but a suborinate position, claiming apostolic authority for her exclusion from the ministry, and, with some exceptions, from any public participation in the affairs of the church.  He has created a false public sentiment by giving to the world a different code of morals for men and women, by which moral delinquencies which exclude women from society, are not only tolerated, but deemed of little account in man.  He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and to her God.  He has endeavored, in every way that he could, to destroy her conficence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.  Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the people of this country, their social and religious degradation -- in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of the United States.                                                                                       <A class=""APCAnchor"" HREF=""http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp?AID=84261530&PSTID=4<ID=16&lang=1"">Buy Posters at AllPosters.com </A>                       Home  |   Speeches  |   Declarations  |   Acts  |   Literature  |   Letters  |   Songs  |   Essays  |   Poetry  |   Shop  |   Email Us         SoJust.net is a project of  EdChange  Founded and maintained by  Paul C.

clueweb09-en0002-02-18276	             Zach’s Theological Musings                           Archive for June, 2008                                     The Declaration of Independence Vs. The Bible, Part I       Tuesday, June 24th, 2008                From the American Declaration of Independence:   We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.    “ All men are created equal “: I’m not sure of the intentions of the founding fathers, but certainly this phrasecan be understood in a Biblically supportedway. For example,   Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to  all men , because all sinned… Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for  all men , so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for  all men . Romans 5:12-18   For God has bound  all men  over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. Romans 11:32   There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. Romans 3:23-24    All men are equally born as sinners in their father Adam. And all men are in need of the grace, truth, and life that only comes, for all men, through Jesus Christ. So far so good. But it seems that what the founding fathers were getting at was something quite different.    “ [T]hey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights “: Hmm, unalienable Rights?  UNALIENABLE RIGHTS!  And anyone who should try to alienate me from these God-given rights is going to be confronted by the musket and the sword!? Now at this point we are starting to sound  very  American, and  very  unBiblical.    Now, I am willing to acknowledge that it is  self-evident  that from the founding of this country,Americans haved loved their  RIGHTS  more than anything else. But is it really self-evident that the  Creator  has bestowed upon mankind certain unalienable Rights (note the capital “R” in the original)? No, at least to my self it is not at all evident. And indeed I don’t recall reading about these unalienable Rights anywhere in God’s recorded Word to mankind.    “ [T]hat among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness “: No. Allow me to be direct for a moment: No!I’m sorry, but no.You and I do not have God-given, unalienable Rights to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. According to Genesis 1-4 and all that follows, sons of Adam can only claim a “Right” to death, slavery, futility, and misery.    A God-given Right to life? Funny thing, it seems self-evident to me that God has granted death authority to crush every man who ever lived.    An unalienable Right to Liberty? Nope! Every one of us is born a  slave  to sin, with no  Right  in ourselves to freedom. Moreover, many people will be born into literal, physical slavery, and even if the system be displeasing to God, He has made no promise that the slaves will be set free in this life (I Cor 7:21).    And the pursuit of Happiness? Well, given the sinful bent under which all men were created equal, any “Right” to pursue happiness on your own terms is amounts to nothing more than a “Right” to partake of the fruit of futility and misery.    Does that make it OK to kill, to enslave, and to thwart another’s pursuit of happiness? No, because we don’t have those rights either! You don’t have the right to life, but I don’t have the right to kill you either. You don’t have the right to liberty, but I don’t have the right to steal your body as property either. You don’t have the right to pursue happiness however you wish, but I don’t have the right to quench your happiness however I wish either.    My dear American brothers and sisters in Christ, I pray that you would join with me in the joyous discovery that by birth you have no God-given rights at all! None whatsoever. No rights! Not the Constitution, not the Bill of Rights, nothing! No rights! None! Except for death and slavery of course.    I say that this is a joyous discovery.Apart from Christ it would not be joyous. It would still be TRUE that you and I have no God-given rights. But there wouldn’t be much cause for celebration in that. But in Christ we have become recipients of  grace and mercy . Not rights. God didn’t owe us the cross. We had no right to the gospel. We didn’t even have any rightful claim to partake of God’s covenantal blessings to Abraham, especially as Gentiles. But we received these things any way. Not as a right. But as an unwarranted, unmerited, undeservedgift.    Not by birth, and not by right, but  In Christ  God has made us many great and glorious promises. In a very unAmerican way, God has promised us not a republic, but a  Kingdom .  HIS  kingdom, where He reigns as the good, loving, gracious, just, righteous, benevolent king over those who have submitted to His  eternal  dominion (no term limits) over  all  areas of their lives.    With all due respect, I’m sorry Thomas Jefferson, but I hear your words as the mere opinions of mankind. For in the course of human events Nature’s God, The Self-Evident One, haspresented us with whatwe might call TheDeclaration of Dependence: “Apart from Me [Jesus] you can do nothing” (John 15:5). So before King Jesus I renounce any real or imagined rights, and direct my happiness to the onlypursuit thatsatisfies: glorifying God by enjoying Him forever.

It's that moment when the walls between us are supposed to melt, when we move beyond the mind and surrender our hearts into the hands of God. It's a prayer that we make as a nation, asking that God's hand be upon us, that He forgive us our errors, and that He bless our new President and his administration.          So having one of the more judgmental people in the ministerial world deliver the invocation seems odd to me, and extraordinarily cynical. Rick Warren has supported what would be the first legislation ever passed in the  United States  to specifically limit the rights of a group of American citizens. What does he bring to the table at the Inauguration other than a cynically calculated wink in the direction of right-wing evangelicals? That kind of motivation, and the name Barack Obama, are supposed to be oxymoronic....aren't they?         Warren  seems like a good man, and I like his book a lot.  But the person who leads the nation in prayer on January 20th should be someone asking God to  forgive  us our sins, not someone who dresses up one of our baser national instincts in pseudo-religious packaging. I want  all  spiritually-minded Americans to feel like bowing their heads during the Invocation at Obama's inauguration, for what could and should be a profound and blessed moment of national healing. Yet now millions of gay and lesbian Americans in this country are supposed to...what?....bow their heads and surrender to the voice of someone who they know has tirelessly worked against their rights? And how does that work? You close your eyes and forget what you know, put it in the background, just say to yourself that this is what being inclusive means?            The problem with that is that by the time you'd done it, even if you could do it, the prayer would be over. At that point on January 20th, Rick Warren will have been given even more of an exalted place in American culture than he has already, with more power to continue his crusade against gay rights.           Barack Obama was and is my choice for President, but in this one thing, he sure doesn't have my vote. He said today that he's a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian Americans, but slaps in the face and advocacy do not go together.

We need to start pushing the homophobes  out  of the spotlight.  No responsible Christian should highlight or honor a homophobe unless he/she repents of his/her sin of homophobia.  We can love the sinner and hate the sin ;-)    Seriously, though, I think homophobia is a deep heresy.  Think about it: in the early days of the church, heretics were declared for adding a single letter - an iota - to the Greek word  homoousios , which said that Christ was of the same substance of the Father, thus making it  homoiousios , of like substance to the Father.  People were excommunicated for this single letter.    If a single iota in a bit of theological arcana describing Christ is enough to make one a heretic, how much more is it heretical to make the name of Christ, He who loves  everyone  unconditionally, into a name of hate?  How  isn't  it heresy to represent Christ as standing  against  people of good will who just want to live normal lives free of discrimination?    Those who engage in hate toward LGBT citizens - including so-called ""upstanding Christians"" like Rick Warren, who's basically Jim Dobson with a goatee - are engaging in heresy.  They are portraying Christ as a figure of hate... and I think it's time to call out what they do as  sin , plain and simple.  Homophobia - the advocation of discrimination of  any  kind against LGBT individuals - is sin, an act against God and against their LGBT brothers and sisters, and those who have engaged in it (like Rick Warren and his ""Christian"" Right brothers and sisters) need to repent of their sin and start working to undo the damage their hate has done.    All that said - he's going to say a prayer.  He'll stand up, speak three minutes of spiritual platitudes with nothing even  skirting  controversy (I'll be surprised if he even says ""in Jesus' name""), there will be the *thwomp thwomp thwomp* of some people clapping while wearing mittens, and he'll sit back down.  He's not getting a Cabinet post or taking part in policy discussions.    This is a deeply offensive choice - and there are many prominent religious figures who  haven't  engaged in such rank homophobia - but there's a certain point at which proper reaction becomes overreaction.  Some of my brothers and sisters on the left have crossed this line - for the right reasons, of course, and with every bit of sympathy and understanding from me, but things like ""this proves that Obama is a liar"" (when his position on this has been completely consistent) or ""this proves that Obama doesn't really care about LGBT rights"" (when he's taken just about every opportunity he's had as a legislator to prove that he does care) are a bit overblown.                                                              Asinus Gravis           December 19, 2008  8:28 PM        Hey, cool it.  This is just civil religion.  It is not as if anything significant rests on it.  It has nothing to do with worship, or real prayer.    If Obama wants to invite a friend to perform in that venue, it is fine with me.    I don't have to approve of an actor's moral or political views to be able to enjoy his performance or contribution to a play or movie that is terrific.    Hang loose!                                                              Rob the Rev           December 19, 2008 10:56 PM        I agree with Marianne Williamson blog completely.    I dont agree with you Asinus Gravis.  This is more than just civil religion.  This prayer of invocation and who prays it is a highly symbolic act.  The person chosen by the president-elect to give it is supposed to represent his/her spiritual values and beliefs.  Does Rick Warren represent Barack Obamas spiritual values and beliefs?  As I recall Obama disavowed his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, because he said he did not represent his spiritual values and beliefs.  Now he choses Rick Warren, who works to take away the civil rights of GLBT people and likens their love and commitment to incest or pedophilia, disallows unrepentant gays and lesbians to join his church and offers a ministry through his church to cure them.  Obama does not, according to him, believe these things.  Obama also believes that womans reproductive rights be protected and Rick Warren does not.   Rick Warren is not the person to represent President-elect Obama or the greater majority of the American people by giving the prayer of invocation at the inauguration.      BTW check out www.soulforce.org for resources to support and minister GLBT folks.    Simple question to ask Obama: Would Obama permit a minister who opposed granting equal rights to interracial couples to deliver the invocation at his inauguration?    Contact Parrag Mehta , President-Elect Obamas LGBT liason on the transition team.-  parag.mehta@ptt.gov and protest Warrens invitation to give the prayer of invocation at the inauguration.                                                               Josh           December 21, 2008 12:32 PM        Obama offered sound, compelling reasons for his choice of Rick Warren to give the convocation. I may not agree with Warren on some issues, but I agree with Obama's -reasoning- in this matter: and that's the reason we elected him - he is a thoughtful, reasonable, considerate person.    Those who complain about Warren's convocation on the basis of a single-issue are showing the exact same kind of intolerance that characterizes the politico-evangelical / neo-conservative mindset. We/you are bigger than that. Back up and look at the (far) bigger picture.    As for marriage... the bigger question is: should governments be in the ""marriage granting"" business at all? Shouldn't ""marriage"" be left to religions? Personally, I see no reason for a constitutional government (local, state, federal) to define or sanction marriage. At all.    At best, governments should offer a ""civil union"" which formalizes legal rights. Religion should be the only body performing a ""sacred right."" I don't want my government meddling in religious affairs. Except.... for special cases (polygamy, underage, etc.), I think government can and should define certain -limitations- of unions. Homosexuality is not one of those cases.    I support Obama, and I support his choice of Warren. I'm contacting his transition team right now and offering my encouragement.    You short-sighted whiners need to stop looking down at your feet and set your eyes on the horizon, and beyond. That includes you, Ms.  W. - Merry Christmas.                                                              samthor           December 23, 2008 12:08 PM        ""Yet now millions of gay and lesbian Americans in this country are supposed to...what?....bow their heads and surrender to the voice of someone who they know has tirelessly worked against their rights?""    exactly.... thank you.  I have too much respect for my rights as a human being to ""tolerate"" someone who advocates I be treated as less.

clueweb09-en0005-58-31863	                                                       I'm Glad Rick Warren Said Yes       Dr. Ray Pritchard       Author, Speaker, President of Keep Believing Ministries                All in all, I’m glad Barack Obama invited Rick Warren to lead the opening prayer at next month’s presidential inauguration. I say that even though I share some of the reservations raised by other evangelicals. Here’s how it shakes out for me:   1) A presidential inauguration necessarily involves a number of symbolic gestures. Inviting Rick Warren means that Barack Obama wants to reach out to the evangelical community, and that in itself is a good thing.      2) The pastor and the president-elect have a prior friendship, which suggests that Rick Warren may have an opportunity behind the scenes to offer godly counsel.     3) Billy Graham traditionally prayed at these events. Perhaps Rick Warren can be seen as taking his place.    4) He can legitimately offer a public prayer for God to grant our new president wisdom, understanding, discretion, and the ability to lead our nation in the fear of the Lord. A prayer can be biblical without being aggressively offensive to a larger audience.    5) I am struck by the gay community’s fierce opposition. They are disappointed in Obama and angry because of Warren’s strong defense of traditional marriage and his support of Proposition 8 in California. The story has become a media firestorm in the last several days. Obama had to know this would happen and he asked Warren anyway.     6) A man is known by his enemies as much as by his friends. Beware, Jesus said, when all men speak well of you. A friend once told me, “You don’t get flack until you’re flying over the target.” The whole gay rights debate represents Ground Zero in the ongoing culture wars. I’m glad for anyone to pray in public who openly represents traditional moral values and the historic understanding of marriage.     I think it was a bold move by Obama and a good decision by Rick Warren to say yes. The stage is now set for what will be the most closely parsed prayer in the history of presidential inaugurations. I expect Rick Warren will offer a thoughtful, biblically-grounded prayer, and I’m glad he’s getting an opportunity to publicly ask God to bless and guide our new president.

Thomas Jefferson  first used the  phrase in the  Declaration of Independence  as a rebuttal to the going political theory of the day: the  Divine Right of Kings . None of Jefferson's biographers [ citation needed ]  or studies of the Declaration [ citation needed ]  accept the claim that the phrase was suggested by  Philip Mazzei , although this claim has been made by non-scholars. [1]   [2]   The opening of the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson in  1776 , states as follows:             We hold these truths to be  self-evident , that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator  with certain  unalienable Rights , that among these are  Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness .          The same sentiment appears in the  Massachusetts Constitution  of 1780, which predates the  U.S. Constitution  by seven years, and was the first of its kind in the world.             Article I. All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.          The year 1780 also marks the first time in America that such wording was used to successfully argue against slavery in a court of law:  Brom and Bett vs. Ashley .  Many people [ citation needed ]  understand these statements to refer to the biblical idea that God created humans in His image.  The thinking is that if we are all created in His image, we are all of equal value and possess the same God-given rights.  Others [ citation needed ]  feel these statements illustrate the idea of  natural rights , a philosophical concept of the  Enlightenment ; many of the ideas in the Declaration were borrowed from the  English   liberal   political philosopher   John Locke .  Locke, however, referred to "" life ,  liberty  and  Property "" rather than the pursuit of happiness.  The phrase has since been considered a hallmark statement in democratic constitutions and similar human rights instruments, many of which have adopted the phrase or variants thereof.    [ edit ]    Applications in American history    Declaring the equality of all men did not, however, prevent the United States from continuing the widespread practice of  slavery . However, President  Abraham Lincoln  relied on the Declaration of Independence when making the case that slavery went against the deepest commitments of the American nation.  Though he did so throughout the  1850s  and into his presidency, the most famous example can be found in the  Gettysburg Address :            Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.          When  Elizabeth Cady Stanton  and others convened in  Seneca Falls, New York  in July 1848, they drafted and signed a document titled the  Declaration of Sentiments .  The opening sentence alludes to this phrase:            We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal.          The phrase was also quoted by  Martin Luther King, Jr.  in his famous  I Have a Dream  speech, as the ""creed"" of the United States:            I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.          [ edit ]   References     ^  According to Joint Resolution 175 of the 103rd Congress, ""the phrase in the Declaration of Independence 'All men are created equal' was suggested by the Italian patriot and immigrant Philip Mazzei.  http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=103_cong_bills&docid=f:hj175eh.pdf   ^  ""The great doctrine 'All men are created equal' incorporated into the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, was paraphrased from the writing of Philip Mazzei, an Italian-born patriot and pamphleteer, who was a close friend of Jefferson."" by John F.

Two words which have taken a beating when uttered simultaneously in recent times. In this post, I am going to break a few ATB ground rules, least of which is linking to Duncan 'Open Post' Atrios Black, and tell you an amusing story about a fight involving Democrats and Religion which has ensued, spreading like bushfire (to coin a phrase) and involving some of the biggest names in the liberal Blogosphere.        It all began, a couple of weeks ago, with an Amy Sullivan article in the  Washington Monthly.    Followed by some ""Knee Jerk God Baiting"" by  Digby. I wonder who all the religious candidates we've unfairly scorned in the past would be? Jimmy Carter? Bill Clinton? (and no, having affairs does not mean you are not religious, just a sinner.) Al Gore? John Kerry? They all go to church and profess to be believers. Are they just not religious enough? Now, it's true that the knee-jerk left doesn't much care for Joe Lieberman but that's not because he's a religious man. It's because he is disloyal and enables the right wing. (We knee-jerk left wingers do tend to be dismissive of right wingers, that's true.) I recall scorning both Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon and neither one of them were particularly religious. Bobby Kennedy was a youthful hero and he was as catholic as they come. In fact, I'm having a hard time coming up with any consistent views on either side toward religious politicians at all. It would seem to me that this entire argument is nothing but a political football used to shut down criticism and advance a particular agenda without having to debate the issues on their own merits.    I hesitate to call this kind of lazy observation ""religious correctness"" because that gives the impression of an objection to rude derisive language about religion. This is something else. It's ""God-baiting"" designed to put any critic on the defensive if the person they are criticizing is religious. (The right, interestingly enough, is using this and its close cousin, race-baiting, very effectively these days. Nice to see people on ""our side"" helping them out --- again.)    Every secular ""knee jerk liberal"" has voted for religious candidates their whole lives. Indeed, it is impossible not to. You cannot get elected in this country if you do not profess religious belief. We have enthusiastically backed candidates who are from every religious tradition and from every region. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were both born again, southern evangelicals. We do not scorn religious candidates, period.    Many of us knee-jerk leftists are hostile to those who want to use the state to dictate the proper social attitudes of its citizens and interfere in their most personal, private decisions, that's true. I would scorn Pat Robertson and Sam Brownback's ideas no less if they were secular. It's the lack of respect for the division of influence between the private and public sphere's that is causing the problem.[...]    Who scorns who again? Perhaps some of these religious politicans could speak to the flock about giving some respect to the non-faithful. It's the Christian thing to do.                       It then continued here with a post from  Faithful Progressive : He dissed Belief Net's Steve Waldman (""I'm so sick of this"") for making the narrow point that: ""... many liberals carry an elitist attitude toward evangelical Christians. Lerner's indictment is far more sweeping. Is he being unfair? I think a distinction should be made between the elites and the rank and file on this. The fact is that most Democrats are religious. But secular liberals, who made up about 16% of the Kerry vote [...] seem to have a disproportionate impact on the party's image and approach "". Here's the thing, Atrios: you may be ""sick of"" such talk, but the next election might well hinge on whether people adopt your dismissive tone or speak in a language that is at a minimum non-confrontational and preferably familiar to evangelical Christians. The sad truth is that some people won't listen to you at all if you don't frame issues in such a manner. Further, in the last month alone there have been three key stories about conservatives and moderates breaking from the grip of Christian right extremists. (Evangelical Climate Initiative; House Catholic Democrat statement that there is more to Christianity than abortion; distancing from Pat Robertson's comments.) Is this a process secular liberals want to encourage or not? Is this an opening back into some red states or not? Gov. Kaine's victory in Virginia demonstrated the political potency of showing respect for religious values in these areas.[...]    Ugh. That, of course, led to a lengthy and  'thoughtful' response by Digby .    Meanwhile, back at the headquarters, Duncan ""my favorite post title is 'Wanker of the Day'""  Atrios Black responds  to a few of his literate readers who have been sending him hate mail regarding the issue: [...]I'm not hostile to religion. I don't much care about religion. I'm not much interested in it. This isn't strange. Most people aren't much interested in religion other than their own, if that.[...]    I am sick of people who keep claiming that the Democratic party is hostile to religious people and controlled by secular liberals who are hostile to religion. If by ""Democratic party"" you mean ""some people who post anonymous comments on the internet"" you may have a point. Otherwise, the idea is ludicrous.    Do the Democrats have a perception problem about religion? Sure. We have a political party which has been claiming to be God's Own Party for decades. We have a mainstream media which equates Christian with Religious Right most of the time, and news anchors who don't think liberals can be ""good Catholics."" We also have some left-leaning Christians who seem to think this perception problem is due to hostility to religion by secular liberals who (see below) have no public presence. I don't understand this. People who perpetuate right wing talking points about Democrats always piss me off especially when they have no basis.    Secularism has essentially no representation in our media or politics. I'm sure there are secular politicians and media types, but few discuss it. No one gets on tv or writes newspaper columns or in any way participates in our contemporary mainstream political discourse and praises secularism or atheism or anything similar, and certainly not in a way which denigrates religious beliefs generally. Advocates for the separation of church and state are not advocating secularism, aside from government secularism, they're simply trying to defend freedom of religion. After some major groveling directed at Black, mainly to do with being eternally grateful for the crumbs given by sheer virtue of linking to him, the liberal Faithful Progressive  concentrates on a lengthy response : ""First, can anyone read the comments to the last post and really think that the hostility of many on the left to religion in general is just a GOP Talking Point? If so, FP's gotta couple of other things to sell ya.""    So, do the Democrats indeed have a perception problem about religion?    The Left Leaning agenda, I would argue, is radical at it's very foundation, whereby the goal is to reform the very value system upon which the government was established. And, as I recall, the Founders wrote a great deal about the fact that if America ever ceased to be a religious society, freedom, and the republican ideal, would fail, because the citizenry would lack the moral virtue to keep it all going.    The framers of our highly successful form of government declared that individual rights are maintained and tempered through individual responsibility, they demanded the confrontation of evil and wrongdoing with the aggressive use of force, and were adamant concerning the freedom to pursue and propagate religion without the encumbrance of government, which, by-the-way, was the original intent of the separation of church and state doctrine. We who lean right simply want to preserve those precepts. We see these as fundamental to our success as a culture and as a nation.    The Liberal left conveniently fails to comprehend the ""E pluribus unum"" motto. What they really want is for the ""many"" to remain ""many""; or, more accurately, to break down the ""one"" into ""many"" without any common culture, moral cohesion, or civil society to bind them. I of course, am familiar with that model from the Balkans, where it worked so very well, ahem (!). My culture has also been under the Turks for 500 years, and we are still reeling from the problems.    If you were to check US law up until the late twentieth century, you would see that religion- Christianity-was also an integral factor in law. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court case of Church of the Holy Trinity vs. U.S.(1892) cited 87 historical precedents in its conclusion that, ""Our laws and institutions must necessarily be based upon and embody the teachings of the Redeemer of mankind. It is impossible that it should be otherwise. In this sense and to this extent, our civilization and our institutions are emphatically Christian.""    The position of the left collapses the moment one takes a look at empirical historical evidence from the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly actual law and governmental practice. Washington, Jefferson, et al, the supposed ACLU Separationists, for some odd reason never objected to the recitation of Christian prayers in school or at official governmental functions, the use of the New England Primer in schools, the use of public lands and buildings for religious events etc.    The left fails to understand that the broad-minded tolerance of the Fathers went hand-in-hand with their desire to actively encourage all religious faith: the proof is in the pudding. Again, I challenge anyone to actually examine American laws and governmental practices of the 18th and 19th centuries- you're in for a real shock. Historical reality makes Jerry Falwell and any other bogeyman of the left look like a real ACLU member by contrast...    Again, the proper relationship of government and religion as conceived of by the founders was to further the cause of religion (not looking too kindly on atheism) and enable its free and untrammeled expression. Yes, these men would have disapproved of ""moments of silence"" in schools- but only because these were men who approved of and allowed actual Christian prayer- sometimes delivered by Christian ministers and priests, no less- in schools, government assemblies etc.    To pretend otherwise by the left is false; it is an Orwellian revision of history, and absolutely no foundation for their scurrilous accusations which range from assertions that the Founding Fathers did not promote a religious society, to accusing them of being deists.    Since the Gore defeat in 2000, left-liberals in the US have turned away from identity politics. You could say that this was one of the few unambiguous intellectual victories of American conservatives, except that devotees of Old Left class politics provided much of the ammunition. At first, the multicultis blasted the likes of me as crypto-racists or, worse yet, crypto-conservatives, but Bush hatred ended all of that, and we became simply the all incompasing Bushies.    The problem for the left is that their agenda has one giant obstacle: Our National Heritage. To overcome this obstacle they will have to rewrite history ... which is being accomplished at a level that should alarm all Americans. They have to rewrite or reinterpret law ... primarily through activist judges, and they have to replace mainstream religion with Human Secularism, which is hostile to the idea of God, denies individual responsibility, and would have America adopt a culture of personal indulgence.    The Anchoress has an excellent discussion  joined by CBS's Dick Meyer in her comments section; instigated by Meyer who is wondering whether political ruminations are worth putting to paper, or  is political debate a futile and dead thing.  In her argument, she draws in religion, which has of course  ""got rather co-mingled with politics, especially for those who have been worshiping at the altar of political correctness, which has it's own list of commandments and sins. [...] so many on the left, their leftiness is their religion...""

""At the core foundation of liberalism lies individual responsibility"".    This is absolutely true with respect to true liberalism and absolutely false with respect to many if not most of those who claim to be liberals today.  The term ""liberal"" has been misapplied, as I see it, to those who have hijacked what was once a great party, the Democrats.      By the generally accepted definition, liberals are those who are willing to go in a new direction, those unbound by tradition.  As I see it, the left and the Democrats are determined to go down the same socialistic paths that have failed time and time again elsewhere and are doomed to fail here.  Two of their greatest social triumphs, Social Security and Medicare, are even now in the initial stages of failure.  If anything, it's the so-called neo-cons (as the name clearly states) who are willing to try something new and who therefore are the true ""liberals"" in the sense of the word I highlight.    I'm proud of the fact my parents WERE Democrats back when that party was worth something.  Some years ago they realized the party had gone wrong and left it, though they like me are not content with the Republicans either.  I suppose if the Democratic party comes to it's senses they might return some day.      I am dismayed at the fall of the Democrats of today and particularly their ""leaders"" - their repeated failures and obvious dishonesty make the future they say they dread all the more probable as they lose their credibility and give the extreme right a better chance of growing stronger with no credible deterrent.  For the record, I'm a registered Independent and like many I dream of the day a viable third party will knock some sense into both Republican and Democrat alike since neither party seems to see the light at the end of the tunnel today.  Meanwhile I vote for by candidate and issue, not by party.             Posted by:    Greg |     Tuesday, May 23, 2006 at 02:27 PM                          Jim,    You can cite those examples and others can cite examples proving the Christianity had a profound influence on the founders...researching some of the original documents will offer you a clear insight into the founders frame of mind. It is not as simple as you posit in your last sentence.    American liberals tend to take a fraction of an arguement and use it without providing any factual data to back it up. The American liberal is desperate to either convince us that the founders were immoral, irrelevant, or unresponsive to Christianity...I would further add that many Unitarians were in fact Christians but Jim is no doubt aware of the history of the UC prior to the 1880's.             Posted by:     Washington  |     Friday, March 17, 2006 at 07:25 PM                          Jim,  What you are suggesting makes zero sense.  Keep your religion out of the Government is only a legitimate statement if you mean that no law shall be passed that requires citizens to take and oath of loyalty to Christ or Mohammed or Baal or some other God (which no one is even remotely asking for).  Please read (or re-read) my above post with an open mind because it is an attempt to clarify the position of religion's legitimate place in public discourse.  Religion is the source and guide of many, many peoples entire world view and informs the type of culture and society they wish to live in.  You are saying that those ideas are off limits.  Check your morals at the door.  The abolitionists brought their religious beliefs directly into American society and that was a good thing right?  Martin Luther King did as well and no one bitches about it.  You just object when those ideas are contrary to yours.  You are censoring the free exchange of ideas if they dont jive with yours.  This is a totalitarian attitude.      This country is deeply Christian.  Where do you think the ideas of progress, individual responsibility, equality, and liberty came from in the first place?  Christianity.  As Rodney Stark writes:     The path to modern times did not suddenly open during the Renaissance any more than it sprang from the head of Zeus.  Western civilization arose progressively over many centuries subsequent to the fall of Rome: the so-called Dark Ages were a period of profound enlightenment in both the material and the intellectual spheres, which when combined with Christian doctrines of moral equality, created a whole new world based on political, economic, and personal freedom.     He continues:    To the extent that participants in controversies over equality of outcomes take any interest in the origins of the assumption of moral equality, they mostly trace it to secular political theorists who wrote during the eighteenth-century Enlightenment or even latermany are content simply to attribute it to liberalism.  Many also express admiration for John Lockes seventeenth-century works as a major source for modern democratic theory, seemingly without the slightest awareness that Locke explicitly based his entire thesis on Christian doctrines concerning moral equality.  Most textbook accounts of the birth of our nation now carefully ignore the religious aspect, as if a bunch of skeptics had written these famous lines from the Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.      Westerners are so steeped in a Christian view of the world that they dont even realize it.  Leftists often remind me of spoiled, rich heiresses like Paris Hilton who were born into extravagant wealth and squander it mindlessly because it has always been there and they assume it always will be.  They have little understanding of the work and perseverance that built their inheritance and treat it as if it were nothing.  The Muslim world does not have this same moral and intellectual inheritance and this is part of the reason that Rights, which we in the West take as a given, are considered alien and contrary to the world which they are seeking to create.      John,  The vast majority of Christians is not now and never will be seek to create a state that is run by the church.  You totally miss the point that we are making&either because you dont understand it, you dont really listen, or you are willfully misinterpreting it to create a straw-man to attack.  Democrats and other Left-wingers are always talking about how the Religious Right has taken over America.  Instead of fabricating a boogey-man how about citing one single example of how, so-called, ""religious extremists"" have taken over the government?  I know you wont, because you cant, because it is a political myth used in a weak attempt at fear-mongering.                   Posted by:    Stefan |     Friday, March 17, 2006 at 07:21 PM                          Separation of Church and State.    Just keep your church out of our government, and I as a liberal and you as a conservative will have no religious issues to quarrel about.    Just how the Founding Fathers wanted it.     http://www.theology.edu/journal/volume2/ushistor.htm    ""Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the gospels; he was uncomfortable with any reference to miracles, so with two copies of the New Testament, he cut and pasted them together, excising all references to miracles, from turning water to wine, to the resurrection.""    ""John Adams, the second U.S. President rejected the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and became a Unitarian. It was during Adams' presidency that the Senate ratified the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with Tripoli, which states in Article XI that:                As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion - as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, - and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arrising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.""    Benjamin Franklin - A direct quote: ""As to Jesus of Nazareth...I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have...some Doubts as to his divinity....""    So, either the Founding Fathers of this country were liars, or you are wrong.             Posted by:     jim  |     Friday, March 17, 2006 at 05:07 PM                          ""...and they have to replace mainstream religion with Human Secularism, which is hostile to the idea of God, denies individual responsibility, and would have America adopt a culture of personal indulgence...""    I don't want to sound flip, but what is more personally indulgent than adopting a twisted version of Christ's teachings that manages to both completely ignore the true spirit of Christ and claim to exhault it at the same time? Forgive me, faithful Christians, but you don't know the first thing about your religion or history. Site as many examples as you like but it is striking how you ignore, just as you do the spirit of Christ, our founding FUNDAMENTAL principals. It is amazing to me how so called ""fundamentalist"" Christians want religion to drive the state. Throughout history the most ""religiou"" folks have always suffered more than anyone else when church was state. What drives you people forward with this crap? Is it just that you like to hear yourselves echo in the chamber misconception you have built so solidly? Is it that your old testament sensibilities have invaded your ability to reason like a malevolent virus? Whatever it is, you are enjoyable for the unintentional irony if nothing else. You don't seem faithful at all, but superstitious to a medieval degree, though certainly cleaver enough to spin whole cloth out of the delicate threads of your research. This country has been mired in self-indulgence for many decades...your blog is a monument to self-indulgence and Christ would NEVER sponser church as state let alone the fanatical church of your superstitions. What bible translation have you been reading? Christ was a radical...hello...he was trying to bring the whole damn thing to the ground so we could KNOW that God wasn't some person, but everything and everywhere. How did you miss that? Are you so lost that you think God, the person, prefers Republicans? or prefers the United States? Or prefers Humans? How sad, and ironically enjoyable all at once.                Posted by:    John |     Friday, March 17, 2006 at 04:04 PM                          Contemporary Liberals, both here and in Europe encourage the noton of a ""cradle to grave society"". I'm sorry that the term Liberal has been de facto hijacked by people who are enamored by the notion that the individual needs to be controlled, coerced, coddled and ultimately imprisoned.    Furthermore Liberals today are generally wary of anything that has to do with Religion. They believe in Marx's dictum: ""Religion is the Opiate of the People"". For a simple reason, religious organizations undermine the power of the state. many people find strength and solace in Religion. Liberals want to be the ones dispensing such luxuries. Perhaps through a Kafkaesque bureauocracy, at a very high cost, imposed on those who work ideally through taxation without representation.    Liberals are completely fearful of the enlightened individual, because a self posessed person might excell in relation to other more mediocre individuals. Lemmings in a gigantic pack may be self destructive, but are a force to be reckoned with...hence the Liberal power base. Liberals are all too willing it seems to embody the proverbial hammer that bangs down the nail that sticks too far out.    A perfect example of one of the multitudes of recent Liberal contaddictions. The forced closure of Catholic Charities an organization that for a century or so placed children with adoptive parents. Why will they have to close down? Because they will not grant adopive rights to gay (contemporary use of the term) couples. So they are willing to trample on one group's rights in order to ensure another group's perceived rights, at the expense of the most important most neglected group of all: the orphans who now stand a far lower chance of being adopted at all, by either straight or happy couples.    The thought process is Byzantine at best. Contradictions, within contradictions, like a giant Russian doll, the contemporary Liberal mind keeps revealing the same thing, perhaps in a different size, but its always the same...It is Socialist, and it has failed over and over again, in each and every part of the world where it has taken root, often devastating indigenous cultures, expropriating entire classes, comitting genocide where need be, diseducating entire generations of people, causing immense demographic and environmental upheaval in record time, etc, etc, etc, etc...Yet this vicious worm is still capable of mutating and morphing under many guises, like VoldeMort in Harry Potter.             Posted by:    Raimondo |     Thursday, March 16, 2006 at 11:52 PM                          As a Catholic who would probably be lumped into the asinine category the Religious Right; allow me try to explain the frustration that I feel with the Democrats (the Left, liberals or whatever).  I am told, by Democrats, that my religious beliefs are respected and encouraged but that I am not allowed to force those religious beliefs on others.  Sound fair right?  Here is the catch.  Let me use abortion as an example for no other reason that it is the easiest.  Science can determine that a human fetus is indeed a form of human life but the real crux of the problem is the debate of when a human person is present necessitating protection under law.  David Byron and I agree that this is not a question that is in purview of scientific knowledge but rather is a philosophical or metaphysical question.  As a member of a democratic society, I have every right to join with other like minded pro-life citizens in the arena of public politics to elect pro-life representatives who we would expect to work for the advancement of our positions through legislation.  Everything is above board so far right?      Well, we are told that since our ideas and positions have a religious component or origin that we are being fascist and that we are forcing our religious beliefs on people by advancing a pro-life cause.  This would be calling the kettle black, so to speak, because, as most people would agree, this is a philosophical question. Those that believe that no human person is present prior to birth are advocating a contrary metaphysical belief.  Why is the pro-life belief out of bounds but yet the pro-abortion belief acceptable when it is forced on the entire society?  Are people allowed only to have their religious belief in private but are forbidden to act in any public manner to affect the society and culture in which they live?  Are we to have a society which is completely stripped of any tinge of religiously informed ideas?  Is America to have, to borrow a famous phrase from the eminent Richard John Nuehaus, a Naked Public Square?  Is this not just paying lip service, in the most belittling and condescending way, to people who hold religious beliefs that differ from the agenda of the Left?  You may have your little beliefs but dont you dare try to act on them?  When the actions these citizens take are peaceful, legal, and through the proper channels of political activity, is it any surprise that religious people are deeply insulted by this demeaning attitude?    The solution the left has come up with is to sell a full menu of moral relativism like the clever idea of being for Choice.  This is the middle ground that Democrats (and the country club Republicans) have tried to sell the country as a compromise.  The result, however, is the same: status quo.  Now we can be pro-abortion, or look the other way and pretend that, what we see as a grievous societal injustice, is not our problem, or we can act and be accused of being religious zealots who favor Taliban style repression.  There is no serious attempt made to meet religious people and their deeply felt concerns.  There is no real respect for their most cherished values.  They are called intolerant, bigots, homophobes, racists, misogynists, hate mongers, and fascists.  Christianity is slandered as if it was the equivalent of Nazism.     If Democrats really want to engage the religious citizen (which they keep saying over, and over, and over, and over&.) then they must be willing to address their concerns seriously and with a genuine respect for their beliefs.  They must find room in their thoroughly secular agenda for a real compromise.  To continue with the abortion example, most pro-lifers would be ecstatic to find support among Democrats for allowing some reasonable limitations or restrictions on the unlimited abortion license. At the very least,  please allow the democratic process to play out (without bypassing the public by appealing to the courts to force your agenda through) in order to let the population as a whole decide what should be allowed and what should not.  This is by no means an unreasonable request.  It would be government for the people, by the people.

It's not pathetic as much as it is obtuse.  First, your sympathy is thinly veiled arrogance (""these poor misguided religious nuts, they aren't as enlightened as I"").  Second, the commonality between the two groups ends at the door of ""they're both religious and they're both upset with behaviors they perceive as sinful"".  As I've mentioned in the past, one must consider the methods that both groups employ to bring their message to the world as well as the actual message itself.  It is here that your comparison breaks down.  Where are the Christian suicide bombers (there are many Palistinian Christians) ... where is the demand by Christians to observe Biblical law (as opposed to the demand for sharia law) ... where are the Christian societies that crush freedoms (and don't even compare abortion restrictions with chopping someone's head off) ... where are the Christian leaders that constantly call for death to those that disagree with them ... found any that fit any of these criteria individually (let alone the many Muslim ones that fulfill each)?    And then you end with saying ... ""But if you ask the rank and file members then I think it's about helping out the little guy against the bullies"" ... I'd add one caveat ... except if that ""bully"" is Saddam and the ""little guys"" are Iraqis ...

It compares the neo-cons with Al-Qaeda and suggests that both are reacting to the perception of a failure of liberalism to keep society moral by creating external enemies for their societies to fight against.    Similarly, and again I'm sorry if this sounds like a pathetic cheap shot, but I think Al-Qaeda (who I think are wrong but have a lot of sympathy for) has a great deal in common with the religious right in America (who I also think are wrong but have a lot of sympathy for).      I mention this in reply to this comment:    ...useful idiots feeding the anti-Western narrative of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri.    But it seems to me that Bin Laden doesn't have an anti-western narrative as such -- at least no more than the right does in general, which is that America is in moral decay.    It seems that they'd be naturally allies if not for the war, and of course they were allies during the Afghan war against the Soviets, when Reagan called them all freedom fighters and compared them to the founding fathers.  (Not that the Democrats didn't ally with them too of course, during the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo).    I wonder how much of the present negative view of muslims is simply generated for purposes of prosecuting Bush's war against Islam?  That happens in all wars of course.    I guess this is getting off the topic of this post - although it all seems to sort of hang together.    What do Democrats believe?  Well judging by what their elected representatives are willing to fight for, nothing at all.  But if you ask the rank and file members then I think it's about helping out the little guy against the bullies.             Posted by:    DavidByron |     Thursday, March 16, 2006 at 11:54 AM                          On the fascism thing again...  obviously my comment was intended to underly a commonality (between the religious right and fascism) which was not of itself a bad thing.  On the contrary a good thing I believe.  But there's a serious worry about America and fascism today.  If we are to learn from history it's no good saying people are fascists.  Because if they are it's too late, and if they are not then you're just flaming people and making it harder for a serious consideration.    And I think someone asked if I had sympathy or compassion for fascists to, and of course I do; you have to be able to see people as people to understand them.      Alexandra did you read the post up at Glenn's place called "" Cornered Rats ""?  Also have you read any  Orcinus ?    As I understand it in part the fascists in Germany were able to gain power by convincing the right that eliminationist rhetoric and actual violence were necessary to defend the country from the left, from communists and from terrorists.  Hitler was able to convince them that in a new kind of war they shouldn't expect their head of state to obey the laws - it was too confining.  There was a lot of fear.    Do not let fear rule you.

I agree with such an initiative. It is important for everyone to know that certain things are accepted here and that, if they do not accept it, they probably should not want to live here.

And that whether or not the founding fathers were Christian, is not the most important thing here. The important thing in this debate is that they did not put the values they had because they were Christians on others.    That is the difference here.

But theres even worse that sheer racism at work here: ironically, by focusing its message on nude beaches, swingers clubs, hash bars&etc. the Dutch government is contributing to the distortion and debasement of Western culture in the eyes of its critics, thus reinforcing their prejudices.    Just like their Neocon friends in Washington and Tel-Aviv, the Muslim-bashers of Amsterdam and The Hague are useful idiots feeding the anti-Western narrative of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri.    Instead of promoting humanistic and secular values by building schools and universities with modernist secular curricula in the Middle-East and South Asia, instead of telling prospective immigrants the world over that Europe is a beacon of humanism and democracy, were content with provoking Muslims gratuitously.    In Hitlers Germany, Jehovah's Witnesses were forced to accept blood transfusion and force-fed ham so they could become good Germans.

I see that you've made up your mind sometime ago who you'll trust to steer the ship. LOL.    Btw, I think the religious right can at times be rather overbearing, but hardly 'frothing'. Alexandra makes a compelling point that a certain vocal faction of the Democrats are the ones who are doing all the 'frothing', or to be precise, 'anti-religious frothing'.  Which brings us back on topic ;-)              Posted by:    North by Northwest |     Thursday, March 16, 2006 at 03:42 AM                          go1,    Apart from your point 1), you'll find that pretty much every Republican voter agrees with you. The only difference is, they feel, the Republicans are doing a better job at achieving/protecting these goals.     I think you can't settle this issue in this general fashion. You also need to accept, that you have essentially two types of voters: one, whose vote is determined by tradition, but who retrofits his arguments to support his ingrained bias; two, who prioritises issues and votes for the candidates who are less likely to mess it up. There is no perfect fit; it'll always be a, more often than not, 'bad' compromise.    As to your point 1). This is a delicate balancing act. If whoever is in charge has its basic motivation wrong, it messes up big time. This is your supertanker-in-the-harbor analogy. Even at a speed of 2-3km/h, it smashes the entire pier.    Also, all these issues are increasingly influenced by lobbyists and less and less by voters or politicians--and as you know you've got good and bad lobbyists on either side of the aisle.    But, you definitely don't want an 'activist' filled with the best intended utopian idealism to do the 'overseeing'. What I think everyone wants is what the Germans call a 'Nachtwchter Staat' in relation to economic regulation; means 'night-watch Government': protect the economy from assault and abuse, but otherwise stay out of day-to-day business.             Posted by:    North by Northwest |     Thursday, March 16, 2006 at 03:23 AM                          Oh, and regarding religion, what do Democrats believe? Democrats believe the same crap Republicans do.   You will find both Democrats and Republicans in almost every church in America.     You will also find Democrats and Republicans who are athiests. Who believe in abortion and actually have abortions. Who claim to be Christians but dont ever go to church.  It happens to both.       Religious frothing by Republicans  is meant to evoke an emotional response.  Its meant to keep people from thinking of ANY OTHER ISSUE.  Because they know they are wrong on so many of the other issues, as far as the common man is concerned.  Maybe not ideologically, but in putting ideas into practice, they are wrong, wrong, and wrong again, almost non-stop.                Posted by:    go1 |     Thursday, March 16, 2006 at 02:23 AM                          Being a liberal to me means:     1) Competition/Economy.  A free marketplace, free from domination by monopolies and cartels.  The only entity that can guarantee this is the government, by granting and having the ability to regulate business.  Only by regulating the giants can you guarantee that there can be true competition in business.      2) Socially.  It means keeping out of my business for the most part.  Republicans seem to want the government to create a nanny-state where police/soldiers outnumber citizens. That equals the sacrifice of our freedom for so-called security.  Give me liberty or give me death . . . anyone remember that who claims to be a Republican?     3) Responsibility.  Democrats are for responsibility for your own actions.  Republicans want to strip the one thing from this country that makes us unique in holding people responsible . . . the right to jury trials.  You take away this right, then guess who will settle disputes that juries once settled?  Beaurocrats appointed by government officials, thats who.  That's what Republicans want, who woulda thunk it.      It all amazes me, the two-tongued Republican mantras always mean exactly the opposite of what they say, when you look at their philosophical ideals, and then you look at their actual actions, how can you ever believe in that?    4) Saving America.  Liberals want America to be America.  Which means that America isnt just a stretch of land and people. America is based on a Constitution, with built in rights, and respect in the division of power in government.  All these things the Republicans in power are currently trashing. Which means that its the Republicans who are trashing America, not liberals.      (Notice I never said Conservatives, because true Conservatives wouldn't do what Republicans are doing).     To me, being a liberal means being an American.                  Posted by:    go1 |     Thursday, March 16, 2006 at 02:08 AM                          And, as I recall, the Founders wrote a great deal about the fact that if America ever ceased to be a religious society, freedom, and the republican ideal, would fail, because the citizenry would lack the moral virtue to keep it all going.    Perhaps so.  But it is noteworthy that absolutely the only mention of religion in the Constitution are the anti-establishment and free exercise clauses.  And there is not a single mention there of God, Jesus, Christianity, or any of its many variants well planted in the former colonies.  So why was all this excluded?    The point of the anti-establishment clause [which I notice you conveniently fail to mention] is to keep government out of favoring particular religious preferences.      ""Establishment"" meant two things to the Founding Fathers:  First, it meant making one denomination only the official religion of all the King's subjects.  People who ""dissented"" or openly held any other beliefs were barred from political participation and subject to greater or lesser legal sanctions depending upon the whims of the goverment of the moment.      Second, it meant the support and patronage of priests of that particular denomination as employees of the government whose livelihood and activities were maintained by public taxes.      This, of course, meant that any country curate in any Anglican rural parish simply could not preach on certain topics if they might offend the local Squire.  This hardly qualifies as ""religious freedom"" even for the members of the Church Established.        When a religion is ""established"", the free exercise clause has no essential meaning because, inherently, ""dissenters"" cease to be equal citizens to the orthodox.  ""Religious freedom"" then degenerates to mere ""religious tolerance"".  Simply promising not to pass a law against someone does not mean you recognize their right to full and equal citizenship under that law.      This was the actual state of religion before the Revolution--full religious freedom was present only in certain colonies:  Rhode Island and Pennsylvania b  "

Click on photo to enlarge.     Here’s an outstanding release from Pastor Bryan Fischer with the  Idaho Values Alliance , an affiliate of  American Family Association . Poor Barack Obama: he’s  promised the world  to one of the  most demanding and unreasonable special interest movements  on the planet. Imagine blasting the gregarious Warren as a  “homophobe”  because he supported Prop 8 in California. (Note the incredibly elastic,  ever-expanding definition of  homophobia .) Our favorite lesbian blog-stremist Pam Spaulding chastises Warren for his  “sad bigotry” HERE  and hits Warren for  “bigotry, small-mindedness and downright ignorance”  (Pam and friends know a thing or two about small-mindedness).   We agree with Bryan about the vaguely threatening nature of this quote by the hypocritical Joe Solmonese, head of the homosexual lobby group  Human Rights Campaign :   Bizarrely, Solomonese says that Warren has “repeated the Religious Right’s big lie that supporters of equality for gay Americans are out to silence pastors.” He appears blind to the obvious fact that that’s exactly what he is trying to do here - put a muzzle on one of America’s leading pastors, proving that it’s hardly a lie at all.   Ominously, Solomonese told  Politico , “There is a lot of energy and there’s a lot of anger and I think people are wanting to direct it somewhere.” If that sounds like a threat to you, I won’t disagree.   Also, note that Tolerant Joe embodies the evil nexus of the abortion and homosexuality movements: “Solmonese is the former Chief Executive Officer of  EMILY’s List , where he oversaw one of the nation’s prominent pro-choice [read: pro-abortion] Democratic political action committees” ( Wikipedia ).   People are finally waking up to the truth: that the homosexual activist lobby is to  tolerance and diversity  what Illinois Gov.  Rod Blagojevich  is to  honest government . — Peter LaBarbera,  www.aftah.org   Below is the Idaho Values Alliance release (write them at  contact@idahovaluesalliance.com ):   _________________________________________   Bryan Fischer, Executive Director, Idaho Values Alliance, 12-18-09   Voices of Tolerance, Diversity, Multiculturalism Come Unglued   Prediction: for the first time in American history, a speaker at a presidential inauguration may be booed unmercifully, and his remarks completely drowned out by angry jeers from an incensed crowd. We may even see shoes tossed at the inauguration platform by the hundreds. It could be a modern day lynching, only this time the victim of a vigilante mob will be proverbially strung up not because of skin color but creed.   Liberals in general and homosexual activists in particular claim to be all about tolerance, diversity, pluralism, multiculturalism and respect for differences.   Well,  their commitment to those values has just been challenged by President-elect Barack Obama, and they have failed the test miserably.   Obama’s criminal offense is that, in a move that ought be celebrated by all who claim that America’s strength is found in its embrace of diversity, he picked an evangelical pastor who supports natural marriage and the sanctity of life to deliver the invocation at his inauguration.   Rick Warren of Saddleback Church has been tabbed for the task, despite the fact he openly supported Prop. 8, which elevated protection for one-man, one-woman marriage into the California constitution.   Said Warren during the campaign for Prop. 8,  “For 5,000 years, every culture and every religion - not just Christianity -has defined marriage as a contract between men and women. There is no need to change the universal, historical definition of marriage to appease 2 percent of our population … This is not a political issue - it is a moral issue that God has spoken clearly about.”   Warren also said, in a recent interview with  Beliefnet , that he is opposed to those who say that abortion should be “safe and rare.”   “Don’t tell me it should be rare. That’s like saying on the Holocaust, ‘Well, maybe we could save 20 percent of the Jewish people in Poland and Germany and get them out and we should be satisfied with that’ - I’m not satisfied with that. I want the Holocaust ended.”   A sample of what the press is calling “universally negative” outrage from the gay rights crowd:   Kathryn Kolbert of People for the American Way: Warren “doesn’t … deserve this position of honor.”  She adds that someone who has “consistent mainstream American values” rather than someone so “radical” should have been picked instead.   Note to Ms. Kolbert: Prop. 8 got the same percentage of votes in California that Obama got nationwide. I guess that means natural marriage is at least as “mainstream” as Obama is, Kathryn.   Sarah Posner of the “Nation” magazine: “Now it (Democratic outreach to evangelicals) has gone too far.”   Joe Solomonese of the Human Rights Campaign to Obama:  “[You] have tarnished the view that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have a place at your table.”  The selection, he says, is a “genuine blow to LGBT Americans,” and added, “We feel a deep level of disrespect when one of the architects and promoters of an anti-gay agenda is given the prominence and the pulpit of your historic nomination.”   Bizarrely, Solomonese says that Warren has “repeated the Religious Right’s big lie that supporters of equality for gay Americans are out to silence pastors.” He appears blind to the obvious fact that that’s exactly what he is trying to do here - put a muzzle on one of America’s leading pastors, proving that it’s hardly a lie at all.   Ominously, Solomonese told Politico, “There is a lot of energy and there’s a lot of anger and I think people are wanting to direct it somewhere.” If that sounds like a threat to you, I won’t disagree.   Solomonese throws Warren’s support for the sanctity of human life into the mix as another unforgivable sin that should disqualify him from public prayer.   Gay rights activist Rick Jacobs: “It’s a huge mistake. (Warren’s) really the wrong person to lead the president into office. His presence on the inauguration stand is a slap in the faces of the millions of GLBT voters who so enthusiastically supported him.  This tone-deafness to our concerns must not be tolerated.  We have just endured eight years of endless assaults on our dignity and equality from a president beholden to bigoted conservative Christians. The election was supposed to have ended that era. It appears otherwise.”   Gawker.com: Warren is “yet one more in a long and historic line of American Huckster Ministers, but he’s still a right-wing crank in mainstream clothing.”   The  Washington Blade , a homosexual newspaper:  “Obama’s first big mistake.”   Obama’s spokesman (generic use) gamely defended the choice, saying, “This is going to be the most inclusive, open, accessible inauguration in American history.”   (But lest evangelicals take too much encouragement from Obama’s decision, his spokesman was quick to say that “The president-elect certainly disagrees with (Warren) on [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] issues.”)   There are several lessons here.     One,  the tolerance crowd has tolerance only for people who agree with them.  They are blindly and hypocritically intolerant to the point of tyranny toward advocates of the Judeo-Christian tradition.   Two,  homosexual activists really are out to silence the voice of evangelical Christians.  They want Warren muzzled and driven off the platform, and my guess is that they will boo him off if Obama doesn’t pull him off first. Unless cooler heads prevail, we may see the exercise of a heckler’s veto like we have never seen before. Imagine the sound of 4 million people booing in unison, and you’ve got a picture of what may happen at the inauguration ceremony…We have only seen the beginning of this saga.  There is just no way left-wing activist groups are done putting pressure on Obama to repent in dust and ashes. They will be relentless until he recants, and make him pay if he doesn’t.   Three,  this shows the utter emptiness of homosexual advocacy of pluralism and multiculturalism.  If they really believed that stuff, they would be celebrating the most inclusive inaugural ceremony in American history. But they won’t because they don’t. Their circle of inclusiveness is far too narrow, tiny and small to have a place in it for conservative Christians.   Four, it doesn’t matter how gracious you are, if you take a stand for natural marriage you will be labeled a hatemonger and a bigot.  Warren is about as gracious, compassionate, jovial and kind as you can get. Fat lot of good that has done for him with the tolerance crowd.     In the worldview of homosexual activists, “loving the sinner, hating the sin” is simply Sunday School bigotry.   This affair gives the lie to the accusation - even shared by many nave Christians - that Christians are hated on this issue because we are condemning and hateful. Warren is neither, and look what they’re doing to him.   We as Christians certainly should continue to be gracious, open-hearted and courteous to all, including homosexual activists. I have always treated them with kindness and friendliness, and I have a fondness and affection for many of them I’ve met. But it is foolish to think this will cause them to like us in return. Disagreement is not hatred - but try telling that to them.

clueweb09-en0005-24-32508	"       On Equality       Dear Kressel,   A friend of mine recently said to me: ""I can't stand being Jewish...women are treated like third class citizens and are so inferior to men."" I tried to explain to my ultra reform friend how wrong she was. That women are so important to Judasim and play such a vital role.    She has been raised in such a liberal home, she does not even care to learn Torah or attend Shul. She says a  mechitzah  bothers her and she wants to go to a shul where she can wear a  Talis , a  kippah , and  teffillin . The sad thing is, when I ask her why she wants to do  all this her answer to me is..."" If men can do it, why can't I?! "" When I ask her why do men do these  mitzvot , she says, "" I don't know, and I don't care. I just want to have equality!""       Kressel responds:   When I was in high school, my class was once discussing Jefferson's assertion that all people are created equal.    ""We aren't really, though,"" said my teacher. ""Some people are born retarded. Are they our equals?""    Other students agreed with this reasoning, but I sensed something wrong with it. The trouble was, I couldn't formulate exactly what.    The issue wasn't clarified for me until I had an insight nearly ten years later. I was working in a home for retarded adults. One day, my charge was a woman in her early 20's, diagnosed as profoundly retarded, which is the most severe classification of retardation. Her mental age below two years. She also had a deformed leg, so I took her out for a walk, a particularly therapeutic activity for her.    Hand in hand, slowly leading her up the street, my mind returned to that discussion in my high school class. The contrast between this young woman and me was so vast it was heartbreaking. In chronological age, I was about five years older than she, but while my active mind could contemplate the philosophical implications of the meaning of equality, she did not even have enough intelligence to achieve toilet training. Yet it was clear to me that on the level of basic humanity, we were equal. We both had an equal right to a safe and peaceful walk, and indeed to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""    ""All. . . [people] are created equal"" does not mean that we were created with equal abilities and opportunities. It means that we are all equal in the eyes of our Creator. The concept of equality does not refer to people's intelligence, abilities, or accomplishments. Those are external conditions. Equality refers to a person's essential humanity. On that level, we are indeed all equal.     It is the same way with  mitzvohs . Imagine two Jewish men: one is very wealthy and one is barely making ends meet. Both are required to fulfill the  mitzvah  of  tzedaka  and give 10% of their income to charity. Dollar for dollar, the wealthy man gives more. Does that mean his  mitzvah  is dearer to G-d than the poorer man's? It would be foolish to think so. The value of the wealthy man's  tzedaka  is that he uses his wealth toward good, unselfish ends. The value of the poorer man's  tzedaka  is that he fulfills G-d's commandment even though it is difficult for him. Dollar and cent values have nothing to do with it.    That is why it is incorrect to assume that because men have numerically more  mitzvohs  than women, they have a superior position in Judaism. That is looking at the external, rather than the internal, at quantity rather than quality. On a qualitative level, men and women have equal opportunities to connect to G-d and to improve themselves morally and spiritually, which is the purpose of Judaism. In fact, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, one of the most widely-respected Torah authorities of this century, wrote, ""in every place the Torah mentions the holiness of the People of Israel, women are also included on an equal basis( Igros Moshe, Orach Chaim  4:49).""    Because men and women were created differently, their  mitzvohs , which are methods of connecting to G-d, are different. The fact that G-d gave them different methods does not make those methods unequal.    Of the 613  mitzvohs  in the Torah, there are 365 prohibitive  mitzvohs . These forbid particular activities, such as eating leavened bread during Passover. Normal, healthy men and women are commanded to keep all of these  mitzvohs .    The remaining 248 are active  mitzvohs . These tell us to perform particular activities, such as ""Love your neighbor as yourself ( Leviticus  19:18)."" Women are exempt from those active  mitzvohs  which include a time-requirement. The  mitzvah  of putting on  tefillin  is an example of this because  tefillin  must be worn before sundown every normal weekday.    Women are exempt from these  mitzvohs  because their daily schedules cannot be subject to such constraints. They are too busy fulfilling the demanding and unpredictable  mitzvohs  of caring for children and maintaining their homes. Even women without children and women with grown children are exempt from these  mitzvohs  because they require a lifetime commitment. However, women in these situations do frequently take a more public role than those in the early stages of motherhood. They usually attend synagogue regularly and are often involved in a wide variety of community services. Women with leadership qualities have ample opportunities to manifest these talents by becoming involved in community service.    Nonetheless, the home and family comprise the central institution of Judaism, and women ideally spend the majority of their lives devoted to them. Some people protest that women's responsibility to the home is unfair and even demeaning, but I cannot understand their attitude. It seems that such people believe that the synagogue offers more opportunity to connect to G-d than raising a family does. I am sure that being wrapped in a pair of  tefillin  and a  tallis  while devoting one's full attention to G-d is an inspiring experience, and I'll never know what it feels like. But my husband will never know the intimacy of nursing a baby, and that is also a service to G-d.    Actually, the clearest insight I've ever had into the nature of G-d was while nursing a newborn. I looked down at that tiny baby clinging to me as if no separation existed between us, and I was overwhelmed with love. I then realized that G-d's love for me is even deeper than my love for my baby. It was at that moment that I understood that a newborn's relationship with its mother is a metaphor for humanity's relationship with G-d.    An infant's dependency on its mother is total. Because its mind is undeveloped, it has no concept of the person on whom it depends. Certainly it cannot fathom the depths of the love that person has for it. It just clings instinctively and takes what it needs, unaware of all the love, nurturance, and protection it is receiving.    Motherhood taught me that lesson, and I'm certain G-d created the physical attachment between a baby and its mother so that we could understand Him better. Men can be wonderfully loving parents, but their bodies can never carry an unborn or nourish a newborn. The depth of the connection is different. It is not an experience I would ever want to trade. Why would I want to do men's  mitzvohs  when womanhood offers so much potential to connect to G-d?    Ultimately, we must remember that we perform  mitzvohs  to serve G-d, and service to G-d necessitates obedience. If humans decide to perform  mitzvohs  as a political statement, it is not service at all. Would a boss tolerate a worker who did only those tasks he wanted to do, rather than what he was told to do? Performing  mitzvohs  on one's own terms is even sillier than that. That is not fulfillment of the commandment of G-d; it is the opposite. Moreover, when women choose to ignore the spirituality intrinsic to femininity simply because the masculine path appears to offer more status, they - and not the Torah - are the denigrators of womanhood.

clueweb09-en0004-50-14381	"           The Right Side of Hope in Rhode Island              — Liberty & American Founding —         November 17, 2008                Father Sirico:  The Way Forward    Donald B. Hawthorne     With a H/T to  Rossputin , here is Father Sirico of the  Acton Institute  offering  his assessment  of the current state of economic thinking:    ...That when one divorces freedom from faith both freedom and faith suffer. Freedom becomes rudderless (because truth gives freedom its direction). It is left up for grabs to the most adept political thug with the flashiest new policy or program; freedom without a moral orientation has no guiding star. Likewise, without freedom and the ability to make moral, economic and social choices, people of faith have restricted practical impact. Theocracy is the destruction of human freedom in the name of God. Libertinism is the destruction of moral norms in the name of liberty. I say a plague on both their houses.    All too many in recent years have at times fallen prey to a consumerist mentality, which is not merely the desire to live better, but the confused idea that only in having more can we be more. Rather than the Cartesian formulation, ""cogito ergo sum"" we have a new one: ""consumo ergo sum.""    How common it has become to live outside ones means, whether its the huge flat screen TV we think we cant do without or the newest automobile or the house larger than our income can afford. The old rallying cry, ""Live free or die,"" has given way to ""Ill die if I cant have it."" Consumerism is wrong not because material things are wrong. No, the Creator pronounced his creation good.  Consumerism is wrong because it worships what is beneath us.    Then there are the imprudent risks assumed in piling up debt on mortgages with a hubris which assumed that values could only continue to rise at 10% or better per year.    To balance the heresy of consumerism, our culture has invented its opposite, environmentalism-as-holy-order. Here the virtue of thrifta traditional, indeed, conservative virtueis reconfigured as a progressive or liberal political demand. Thrift, that ""handmaid of enterprise,"" was mothered by scarcity, a scarcity that unregulated pricing in a free market has, better than all economic systems in human history, served best to mitigate. What an obscenity, then, that the principle of thrift should be employed in the mouths of those who oppose this system of natural rationing and allocation, preferring instead top down systems of distribution that would bring poverty and misery to any nation that fully embraced them.     And what must be said about the mortgage originator who sold a loan knowing the customer could ill afford it? Who cared only for the bonus that loan would generate, knowing that the loan would be sold off to some other unknowing bank within days?     And then there is Wall Street. How often the greed and avarice of Wall Street has been skewered and denounced by the East Coast cognoscenti literati, creatures who would not recognize a moral principle if it bit them in their Aspen condos. Most often Wall Street, functioning as a surrogate for the free economy, is denounced for all the wrong reasons: for seeking and making a profit, as though running in the red was somehow a moral virtue and every attempt to be productive was greed. No, if we are going to offer a moral critique of Wall Street, let us not do it because free markets allocate and produce capital, without which peoples homes and savings evaporate, or to be more precise, never get created in the first place. Rather, let us offer a moral critique because all these previously private businesses are now waddling up to the governmental trough begging to be nationalized or subsidized and demanding their share of the dole. Isnt it obvious that once we concede the principle of a bail-out for those ""too big to fail,"" we invite a queue that will wrap around the globe?    But if tonight I appear to be a generous distributor of anathemas, let me now turn my attention to the institution which initiated, enabled, enhanced and will deepen and sustain this economic and moral hazard. I speak of that institution which has been doing this for the last several decades, and that is the Invasive State as opposed to a limited government. Tocqueville taught us long ago the lesson we are about to re-learn, namely that a society where the moral tie is weakened and where no one accepts responsibilities and consequences for their actions will quickly morph into an authoritarian, State-centered society.     The only society worthy of the human person is a society that embraces freedom and responsibility as its two indispensable pillars which is a society that understands that our individual good depends on our common good and vice versa. Let us reflect upon some crucial facts that are too often overlooked.    The institution of governmentwhat many view as the first resort of charityis the very thing that unleashed and encouraged those vices of greed and avarice and reckless use of money that got us into the current financial imbroglio. It did so by first placing a policy priority on a worthy goal, increased home ownership, but pursued it with a fanaticism that neglected other goods such as prudence, personal responsibility and rational risk assessment.     Moreover, its official banking centers enjoyed subsidies which distorted that most sensitive of price signalsthe price of moneyto delude both investors and consumers into believing that capital existed to support vast and extravagant consumerism when in fact no such capital and savings existed.    Its an obvious point but one the mainstream media appears intent on missing: The financial crisis did not occur within a free market, a market permitted to work within its own indigenous mechanism of risk and reward, overseen by a juridical framework marked by clarity, consistency and right judgment. Quite the contrary. The crisis occurred within a market deluged and deluded by interventionism.     Today we find institution after institution ""in the tank"" for unrestrained government intervention. One is reminded of Italian philosopher Antonio Gramscis call for the left to begin a long march through the institutions of Western Civilization. The left, it seems, got the memo. How will we respond to this disheartening situation? Now is no time to retreat in disarray. Now is no time to stumble. There remains a remnant & a potent remnant who has not bowed the knee to big government. My call to you tonight is a transparent one: strengthen the soldiers of that remnant. In particularstrengthen that band of brothers gathered with you tonight, the Acton Institute.     Never in Actons nearly 20 year history has our message been more essential than right now. As an institution that cherishes the free and virtuous society, we are living through this thing with all of you, and we need your help to continue. Our history of integrity; the quality of our products and programs; the responsible tone with which we approach the questions at hand, all speak to the fact that this work is worthy of your investment. I humbly ask for it with the promise that we will use it well and prudently.     The fact of the matter is that too many of us have become much too comfortable and yielded to a perennial temptation, the temptation to take our liberty for granted. Those of you who have invested in the work of the Acton Institute over the years knowand especially those of you who have had a chance to see our latest media effort ""The Birth of Freedom"" knowwe believe the time has come for a renewal of those principles that form the very foundation of civilization, the same principles that make prosperity possible and accessible to those on the margins.     Liberty is indeed, as Lord Acton said, ""the delicate fruit of a mature civilization."" As such it is in need of a nutritious soil in which to flourish. In this sense you and I are tillers of the soil, if you will.     Liberty is a delicate fruit. It is also an uncommon one. When one surveys human history it becomes evident how unusual, how precious is authentic liberty, as is the economic progress that is its result. These past few weeks are a vivid and sad testimony to this fact. As a delicate fruit, human liberty as well as economic stability must be tended to, lest it disintegrate. It requires constant attention, new appreciation and understanding, renewal, moral defense and integration into the whole fabric of society.    In a trenchant analysis of the free society, Friedrich Hayek once offered a sobering speculation:     ""It may be that as free a society as we have known it carries in itself the forces of its own destruction, and that once freedom is achieved it is taken for granted and ceases to be valued&"" and then he goes on to ask, ""Does this mean that freedom is valued only when it is lost, that the world must everywhere go through a dark phase of socialist totalitarianism before the forces of freedom can gather strength anew?""     He answers, ""It may be so, but I hope it need not be.""    Hayek offers what I consider a partial remedy to this threat. He argues that ""if we are to avoid such a development, we must be able to offer a new liberal program which appeals to the imagination. We must make the building of a free society once more an intellectual adventure, a deed of courage."" (The Intellectuals and Socialism, F. A. Hayek).    He is right of course, but Hayek left something out: We must make the building of the free society once more a moral adventure  for its construction was morally inspired in the first place. It emerged from a vision of man as a creature with an inherent and transcendent destiny. This vision, this anthropology, inspired the institutions of Western Civilization: Universal human rights; the right to contract and private property; international institutions of charity; the university. All these formed because of the high view of human dignity we inherited from our Judaeo-Christian tradition.    Earlier, I gave you only the dark side of St. Jeromes story. A brighter side emerged however, when St. Athanasius came on the scene and scattered the errors of Arianism, defeating its arguments and confounding its proponents. The rectitude of Athanasius ideas inspired the Christian faithful to rise up and affirm what they knew to be their tradition, their prayer, their birthright and their heritage.     As a priest, part of my calling is to defend that Tradition. As a child of America and the West, I have a second birthright to defendthe free and virtuous society. Please help us in the critical task of demonstrating why it is not merely the technical proficiency of markets that will enable us to surmount the economic crisis we face. Help us to continue our effort to convince people that economic and moral excellence is of a piece.    People will never surrender themselves for an abstract point of utility. But for a moral adventure? For a deed of moral courage on behalf of human liberty? For this, we will be able to summon a vast army.       7:09 PM    |  Comments (1)      |  TrackBack (0)                 September 19, 2008                Levelling    Marc Comtois     Sen. Joseph Biden, September 18, 2008 : We want to take money and put it back in the pocket of middle class people.  Anyone making over $250,000&.Is going to pay more. You got it.  Its time to be patriotic , Kate. Its time to jump in, its time to be part of the deal, its time to help get America out of the rut. Alexis de Tocqueville : The evils that freedom sometimes brings with it are immediate; they are apparent to all, and all are more or less affected by them. The evils that extreme equality may produce are slowly disclosed; they creep gradually into the social frame; they are seen only at intervals; and at the moment at which they become most violent, habit already causes them to be no longer felt.    The advantages that freedom brings are shown only by the lapse of time, and it is always easy to mistake the cause in which they originate. The advantages of equality are immediate, and they may always be traced from their source.    Political liberty bestows exalted pleasures from time to time upon a certain number of citizens. Equality every day confers a number of small enjoyments on every man. The charms of equality are every instant felt and are within the reach of all; the noblest hearts are not insensible to them, and the most vulgar souls exult in them. The passion that equality creates must therefore be at once strong and general. Men cannot enjoy political liberty unpurchased by some sacrifices, and they never obtain it without great exertions. But the pleasures of equality are self-proffered; each of the petty incidents of life seems to occasion them, and in order to taste them, nothing is required but to live.       12:30 PM    |  Comments (9)      |  TrackBack (0)                 July  4, 2008                Happy Birthday, America!    Donald B. Hawthorne     Once again, in celebration of America's birthday, here are excerpted gems from previous postings about our beloved country - brought together in one posting:    President Calvin Coolidge gave a  powerful speech  in 1926 on the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.  If you want to rediscover some of the majesty of the principles underlying our Founding, read Coolidge's entire speech.  Here are some key excerpts:    There is something beyond the establishment of a new nation, great as that event would be, in the Declaration of Independence which has ever since caused it to be regarded as one of the great charters that not only was to liberate America but was everywhere to ennoble humanity.   It was not because it proposed to establish a new nation, but because it was proposed to establish a nation on new principles, that July 4, 1776, has come to be regarded as one of the greatest days in history...    ...Three very definite propositions were set out in [the Declaration's] preamble regarding the nature of mankind and therefore of government.  These were the doctrine that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that therefore the source of the just powers of government must be derived from the consent of the governed...    While these principles were not altogether new in political action, and were very far from new in political speculation, they had never been assembled before and declared in such a combination...    It was the fact that our Declaration of Independence containing these immortal truths was the political action of a duly authorized and constituted representative public body in its sovereign capacity, supported by the force of general opinion and by the armies of Washington already in the field, which makes it the most important civil document in the world...    ...when we come to a contemplation of the immediate conception of the principles of human relationship which went into the Declaration of Independence we are not required to extend our search beyond our own shores.  They are found in the texts, the sermons, and the writings of the early colonial clergy who were earnestly undertaking to instruct their congregations in the great mystery of how to live...    In its main features the Declaration of Independence is a great spiritual document.  It is a declaration not of material but of spiritual conceptions.  Equality, liberty, popular sovereignity, the rights of man - these are not elements which we can see and touch.  They are ideals.  They have their source and their roots in religious convictions...Unless the faith of the American people in these religious convictions is to endure, the principles of our Declaration will perish...    About the Declaration there is a finality that is exceedingly restful. It is often asserted that the world has made a great deal of progress since 1776, that we have had new thoughts and new experiences which have given us a great advance over the people of that day, and that we may therefore very well discard their conclusions for something more modern. But that reasoning can not be applied to this great charter. If all men are created equal, that is final. If they are endowed with inalienable rights, that is final. If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is final. No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions. If anyone wishes to deny their truth or their soundness, the only direction in which he can proceed historically is not forward, but backward toward the time when there was no equality, no rights of the individual, no rule of the people. Those who wish to proceed in that direction can not lay claim to progress. They are reactionary. Their ideas are not more modern, but more ancient, than those of the Revolutionary fathers.      In all the essentials we have achieved an equality which was never possessed by any other people...The rights of the individual are held sacred and protected by constitutional guarantees, which even the government itself is bound not to violate.  If there is any one thing among us that is established beyond question, it is self-government -- the right of the people to rule.  If there is any failure in respect to any of these principles, it is because there is a failure on the part of individuals to observe them.  We hold that the duly authorized expression of the will of the people has a divine sanction...The ultimate sanction of law rests on the righteous authority of the Almighty...    ...We live in an age of science and of abounding accumulation of material things.  These did not create our Declaration.  Our Declaration created them.  The things of the spirit come first.  Unless we cling to that, all of our material prosperity, overwhelming though it may appear, will turn to a barren sceptre in our grasp.  If we are to maintain the great heritage which has been bequeathed us, we must be like-minded as the fathers who created it...We must cultivate the reverence which they had for the things that are holy.  We must follow the spiritual and moral leadership which they showed...    This  Power Line posting  elaborates further on the uniqueness of the American creed:    Knowledge of American history holds the key to much of the current discussion of political issues, such as the ongoing liberal attack on Christian belief and on arguments premised on belief in God...Absent knowledge of American history, one would never know that the United States is founded on the basis of a creed, rather than on tribal or blood lines, in which God plays a prominent part. Absent knowledge of history generally, one would never know that this fact makes America unique.    What is the American creed?...The American creed is expressed with inspired concision in the words of the Declaration of Independence...    But does the Declaration have any legal status such that these words can be truly deemed to state the American creed? It does, although virtually no one seems to know it. In 1878 Congress enacted a revised version of the United States Code that included a new first section entitled ""The Organic Laws of the United States.""     The Code is Congress's official compilation of federal law; the organic laws of the United States are America's founding laws. First and foremost of the four organic laws of the United States is the Declaration of Independence...    Professor Jaffa [of the  Claremont Institute ] teaches us that the Declaration contains four distinct references to God: He is the author of the ""laws of...God""; the ""Creator"" who ""endowed"" us with our inalienable rights; ""the Supreme Judge of the world""; and ""Divine Providence."" Americans declared their independence, ""appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions.""    The Declaration states the American creed, the creed that recognizes the source (Nature and Nature's God) of our rights.     Anchor Rising's own Mac Owens gave a speech entitled  Limited Government to Protect Equal Rights , published on this blog site, which elaborates further on the uniqueness of the American Experiment:    Before the American founding, all regimes were based on the principle of interest - the interest of the stronger. That principle was articulated by the Greek historian Thucydides: ""Questions of justice arise only between equals. As for the rest, the strong do what they will. The weak suffer what they must.""...   The United States was founded on different principles - justice and equality...It took the founding of the United States on the principle of equality to undermine the principle of inequality...Thanks to the Founders, the United States was founded on a principle of justice, not the interest of the stronger. And because of Lincoln's uncompromising commitment to equality as America's ""central idea,"" the Union was not only saved, but saved so ""as to make, and to keep it, forever worthy of saving...""    ""Every nation,"" said Lincoln, ""has a central idea from which all its minor thoughts radiate."" For Lincoln, this central idea was the Declaration of Independence and its notion of equality as the basis for republican government - the simple idea that no one has the right by nature to rule over another without the latter's consent...    Indeed, it is the idea of equality in the Declaration, not race and blood, that establishes American nationhood, constituting what Abraham Lincoln called ""the mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land...""    The United States is a fundamentally decent regime based on the universal principle that all human beings are equal in terms of their natural rights...    ...the only purpose of government is to protect the equal natural rights of individual citizens. These rights inhere in individuals, not groups, and are antecedent to the creation of government...    Roger Pilon wrote the following in a 2002 Cato Institute booklet containing the Declaration of Independence and Constitution:    Appealing to all mankind, the Declaration's seminal passage opens with perhaps the most important line in the document:  ""We hold these Truths to be self-evident.""  Grounded in reason, ""self-evident"" truths invoke the long tradition of natural law, which holds that there is a ""higher law"" of right and wrong from which to derive human law and against which to criticize that law at any time.  It is not political will, then, but moral reasoning, accessible to all, that is the foundation of our political system.   But if reason is the foundation of the Founders' vision...the method by which we justify our political order...liberty is its aim.  Thus, cardinal moral truths are these:    ...that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness...That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.    We are all created equal, as defined by our natural rights; thus, no one has rights superior to those of anyone else.  Moreover, we are born with those rights, we do not get them from government...indeed, whatever rights or powers government has come from us, from ""the Consent of the Governed.""    And our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness imply the right to live our lives as we wish...to pursue happiness as we think best, by our own lights...provided only that we respect the equal rights of others to do the same.  Drawing by implication upon the common law tradition of liberty, property, and contract...its principles rooted in ""right reason""...the Founders thus outlined the moral foundations of a free society.    Dr. Pilon concluded his essay by writing:    In the end, however, no constitution can be self-enforcing.  Government officials must respect their oaths to uphold the Constitution; and we the people must be vigilant in seeing that they do.  The Founders drafted an extraordinarily thoughtful plan of government, but it is up to us, to each generation, to preserve and protect it for ourselves and for future generations.  For the Constitution will live only if it is alive in the hearts and minds of the American people.  That, perhaps, is the most enduring lesson of our experiment in ordered liberty.    The powerful words from and about our Founding appeal to timeless moral principles grounded in both our Declaration of Independence and the great moral traditions that preceded our Founding.  It is these principles that make America unique and inspire us to be proud, engaged citizens who are vigilant stewards of freedom and opportunity for all Americans.    Happy Birthday, America!    EXTENDED ENTRY    Power Line has  these words  from Abraham Lincoln.    The  Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation  released its  E Pluribus Unum:  The Bradley Project on America's National Identity  report last month.    I received an email last night from The Claremont Institute which included these words by Christopher Flannery about our Founding:    American children are not born understanding the principles of their country, and most American college studentsif reports can be believedare still largely unfamiliar with them when they graduate. So it is a useful tradition, as the Fourth of July comes around each year, to reflect againand againon the American political principles famously proclaimed on the original Independence Day, which, as many college graduates know, happened sometime in the past, possibly during summertime. Lest we seem to rest all our political expectations on the capacity of the next generation for self-government, let us admit that the grownups, as well, can benefit from an annual refresher.    As Thomas Jefferson said late in life, when explaining the genesis of the Declaration of Independence, the ideas expressed in it were ""the common sense of the subject"" in Revolutionary America. In drafting the Declaration, he had not meant to proclaim any ""new principles, or new arguments, never before thought of,"" but merely to express ""the American mind."" The Declaration contains a stunning summation of the principles of free government; but it was only because the American people had already learned to understand and to embrace these principles that it was possible to establish an American republic. As the Declaration proclaims, the just powers of government are derived from ""the consent of the governed."" Only a people prepared to consent to a republic is capable of establishing oneor capable of keeping it, as Benjamin Franklin later reminded his fellow citizens. Are we still such a people? No one else can answer this question for us. It is up to this generation, as it has been up to each generation that preceded us and will be up to each generation that succeeds us, to demonstrate our capacity for self-government. This we do for our own sake and for the sake of the cause to which our country was dedicated on that Fourth of July long ago.     Through the Declaration of Independence and the long war that followed it, the American people ""assume[d] among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle[d] them."" The most famous passage of the Declaration explained to the world what Americans regarded as the principled foundations and purposes of their political independence:    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.    The self-evident truth ""that all men are created equal"" is the most fundamental and far-reaching principle affirmed in the Declaration. This is the central idea of the American political experiment from which all other ideas radiate. It is a philosophical idea about human nature, the natural relation of each human being to all others, and the place of all human beings in the natural or created universe.    The revolutionary and founding generation of Americans expressed this idea of human equality in a variety of ways. The language of the Declaration of Independence is ""that all men are created equal."" To express the same idea, the Virginia Declaration of Rights (June 12, 1776) stated that ""all men are by nature equally free and independent."" The Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (March 2, 1780) stated that ""All men are born free and equal.""     All of these phrases are different ways of expressing a doctrine about the ""state all men are naturally in,"" which the American colonists had learned in large part from the English philosopher John Locke. Locke had written, less than a century before the Declaration of Independence, that all men are naturally in    a  state of perfect freedom  to order their actions and dispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature, without asking leave or depending upon the will of any other man.   A  state  also of  equality , wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another: there being nothing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rank promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature, and the use of the same faculties, should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection, unless the Lord and Master of them all, should by any manifest declaration of his will set one above another, and confer on him by an evident and clear appointment an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty.    To say that all men are by nature equal is to say that human beings are not naturally subordinated one to another: No man is by nature a master; no man is by nature a slave. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, in his last extant letter, written just the week before he died: ""the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God."" Human beings, then, are naturally free as they are naturally equal. It is from natural human equality and freedom that the founders derived the idea that government could only justly be founded on consent. Because human beings are not naturally subordinated to one anotherthat is, because they are equal and freetheir consent must be obtained before any human being may rightfully exercise authority over them. It is the voluntary consent of the people that gives authority to government.     Government among free and equal men is formed, the American Founders would say, by ""social compact."" In the words of the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780: ""The body-politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals: It is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people."" The American body-politic is a social compact in which each citizen is pledged to the defense of all and all to the defense of each for the sake of the ends set forth in the American Declaration of Independence, through the means established in the United States Constitution. This is the political community begun when, in the last words of the Declaration of Independence, ""for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge[d] to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.""    Because they are equal and free by nature, human beings may not rightfully consent to just any governmentto a form of tyranny, for example. In the idea of natural human equality and freedom is the recognition of human rationality and of the limits of human rationality. As Locke wrote, ""we are born free as we are born rational."" Because human beings are by nature rational beings, one man may not rightly rule over another as he may rightly rule over a non-rational being (like a dog or a horse). But also, because no man is all-knowing or all-goodthat is, because human reason is limited and fallible and subject to human passionsone human being may never rightly subject himself to the unrestrained will or unlimited power of another. This is what James Madison meant when he wrote that ""government... [is] the greatest of all reflections on human nature[.]""    If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.    Human nature or human equalitythe fact that human beings are neither angels nor mindless brutesgives rise to the idea of constitutional or limited government. This is a political constitution that conforms to the natural constitution of man. Because human beings are fallible and because their reason is subject sometimes to their passions, human government must be subject to law. Human beings would only reasonably consent to be ruled by laws made by another if that other agreed to be bound by the same laws.    A nation ""dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"" willif circumstances permitbe under a ""government of the people, by the people, for the people."" In other words, the principle of equality gives rise most naturally to a democratic or republican form of government. James Madison expressed this idea in  Federalist  39, where he considered whether the government proposed under the new constitution would be ""strictly republican."" ""It is evident,"" he wrote,     that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government.    This brings us votaries of freedom back to where we began. So let these suffice for our Fourth of July reflections this year, save one final thought. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld thought it prudent recently, in the  Wall Street Journal , to offer his fellow Americans the following sober reminders:     The years after our war of independence involved a good deal of chaos and confusion. There were uprisings such as Shays' Rebellion, with mobs attacking courthouses and government buildings. There was rampant inflation caused by the lack of a stable currency and the issue of competing paper monies by the various states. There were regional tensions between mercantile New England and the agrarian South. There was looting and crime and a lack of an organized police force. There were supporters of the former regime whose fate had to be determined. Our first effort at a governing charterthe Articles of Confederationfailed miserably, and it took eight years of contentious debate before we finally adopted our Constitution.    Even for the heroic Revolutionary generation of Americans, there was much to learn and much to overcome on the way to ensuring that free government would be good government. So let us gather again on Constitution Day, September 17, to continue the conversation. It will do us all goodyoung and old alike.    Happy Fourth.

Bill was at once remarkably ecumenical  and knowledgeably discriminating. He had a taste for profound reflection about man and God  and for fierce polemicizing against socialists and appeasers.

(And, as an example of hope, read the rest of Robinson's post about Gorbachev.)    A more scholarly discussion of hope and its connection to faith can be found in Pope Benedict XVI's second encyclical,  Saved in Hope , which includes these words:    ...According to the Christian faith, ""redemption"" - salvation - is not simply a given.  Redemption is offered to us in the sense that we have been given hope, trustworthy hope, by virtue of which we can face our present...The Gospel is not merely a communication of things that can be known - it is one that makes things happen and is life-changing.

Listen to what they said when signing the Declaration of Independence in 1776.  They made a pretty bold and audacious statement.  They said ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among these, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness""&    Now, the idea of everyone being equal was dramatically different from what the rest of the world was practicing.  It was such a radical idea because, up until then, there were variations in people's perceived worth and value.  With the signing of that document, they established a government unlike any other that said that no person was more valuable than another, which meant that no person was less valuable than another.  What that still means, after all these years, is that where we live, what job we have, our abilities, or our disabilities do not factor in to who we are in terms of our worth as a person.  And at any point in our personhood, our value is equal to that of anybody else... On how a pro-life culture stands in stark contrast to our Islamofascist enemy (and kudos to Governor Huckabee for his willingness to use the term Islamofascism)& Contrast this to the Islamofascists.  Theirs is a culture in which it is OK to strap a bomb on to your own child, and send that child into a room like this and detonate it in order to make a political point.  Ladies and gentleman, I prefer a culture of life. On his basic defense philosophy& As Commander-In-Chief, I am going to make sure that America has the most prepared, well-equipped, well-trained, well-financed army Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, so that nobody on this earth would want to engage us in a battle, because they would know that the outcome would be determined by the quality of the forces we have in place to overcome them. And on the logic of a consumption tax system over an income tax system in a globalized world& A table built in Rhode Island has a 22% embedded cost from the government, for every unit that is built.  If that same table is built in China&it's not taxable when it's being made, and its not taxable when it comes to this country.  And we wonder why American made things are struggling?         1:00 PM    |  Comments (3)      |  TrackBack (0)                 December  6, 2007                Romney Speech:  The Public Square Cannot Be Naked    Donald B. Hawthorne     The Corner provides  excerpts  from Mitt Romney's speech today, which suggest it will focus on the broader strategic question of what role religion should play in the American public square instead of the granularity of Mormon theology:    There are some who may feel that religion is not a matter to be seriously considered in the context of the weighty threats that face us. If so, they are at odds with the nation's founders, for they, when our nation faced its greatest peril, sought the blessings of the Creator. And further, they discovered the essential connection between the survival of a free land and the protection of religious freedom. In John Adam's words: 'We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion... Our constitution was made for a moral and religious people.   Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom. Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God. Freedom and religion endure together, or perish alone&    When I place my hand on the Bible and take the oath of office, that oath becomes my highest promise to God. If I am fortunate to become your president, I will serve no one religion, no one group, no one cause, and no one interest. A President must serve only the common cause of the people of the United States&    There are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his church's distinctive doctrines. To do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the constitution. No candidate should become the spokesman for his faith. For if he becomes President he will need the prayers of the people of all faiths&    It is important to recognize that while differences in theology exist between the churches in America, we share a common creed of moral convictions. And where the affairs of our nation are concerned, it's usually a sound rule to focus on the latter  on the great moral principles that urge us all on a common course. Whether it was the cause of abolition, or civil rights, or the right to life itself, no movement of conscience can succeed in America that cannot speak to the convictions of religious people.    We separate church and state affairs in this country, and for good reason. No religion should dictate to the state nor should the state interfere with the free practice of religion. But in recent years, the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning. They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God. Religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life. It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America  the religion of secularism. They are wrong.     The founders proscribed the establishment of a state religion, but they did not countenance the elimination of religion from the public square. We are a nation 'Under God' and in God, we do indeed trust.     We should acknowledge the Creator as did the founders  in ceremony and word. He should remain on our currency, in our pledge, in the teaching of our history, and during the holiday season, nativity scenes and menorahs should be welcome in our public places. Our greatness would not long endure without judges who respect the foundation of faith upon which our constitution rests. I will take care to separate the affairs of government from any religion, but I will not separate us from 'the God who gave us liberty&    These American values, this great moral heritage, is shared and lived in my religion as it is in yours. I was taught in my home to honor God and love my neighbor. I saw my father march with Martin Luther King. I saw my parents provide compassionate care to others, in personal ways to people nearby, and in just as consequential ways in leading national volunteer movements&    My faith is grounded on these truths. You can witness them in Ann and my marriage and in our family. We are a long way from perfect and we have surely stumbled along the way, but our aspirations, our values, are the self -same as those from the other faiths that stand upon this common foundation. And these convictions will indeed inform my presidency...    The diversity of our cultural expression, and the vibrancy of our religious dialogue, has kept America in the forefront of civilized nations even as others regard religious freedom as something to be destroyed.    In such a world, we can be deeply thankful that we live in a land where reason and religion are friends and allies in the cause of liberty, joined against the evils and dangers of the day. And you can be certain of this: Any believer in religious freedom, any person who has knelt in prayer to the Almighty, has a friend and ally in me. And so it is for hundreds of millions of our countrymen: we do not insist on a single strain of religion - rather, we welcome our nation's symphony of faith.    The Mormon tradition has some serious theological differences with Catholic and Protestant traditions.  Yet, there are also theological differences which exist between Roman Catholicism and Protestant traditions, Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox traditions, Pentecostal and main line Protestant traditions, Evangelical and main line Protestant traditions, Christianity and Judaism, as well as Orthodox, Conservative and Reformed traditions of Judaism.  We can argue about theological particulars but I haven't found that to be interesting since college days when we debated all sorts of topics.  And even then, those debates were often inconclusive or unproductive.      But the issue regarding what is the proper role of religion in the American public square - including how it informs the way we live together as a nation, a community, and a family - is a most important debate.  That debate requires a certain moral seriousness, which can exist across differing religious traditions.  It further requires us to take a serious look again at the principles of our Founding, which affirm that we are born with our rights which come from the Creator and ""the laws of nature of and of nature's God,"" not the government.  And, as the Founders stated, morality cannot be sustained without religious influence.      It is a debate which has not been conducted openly and honestly in recent times, as noted in the earlier Anchor Rising posts highlighted in the Extended Entry below.    If Romney's speech reignites a public debate on what should fill our public square, he has then made an important contribution to our civic discourse.

However, while the text is part of the original article, the links are not. The author of this article may or may not agree with the views expressed on those pages, or necessarily anything else on this site.. See   Seeker Friendly, Church Growth Failures in The Bible   AFTER PERSONALLY  covering the  Saddleback Community Church   ""Building a Purpose-Driven Church"" seminar held in Southern California this past January, it became clear to me that some of today's most influential religious leaders misunderstand and misrepresent the true purpose of the church today. Dr. Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Community Church and director of the   ""Building a Purpose-Driven Church""   workshops, has influenced thousands of churches during the last decade that are interested in the ""Church Growth Movement."" Without doubt, every church in the United States must give, or has already had to give, an answer to the strategies of building a superchurch. Sadly, many have already jumped on board. The possibility of dynamic growth for struggling churches, especially old-fashioned, Bible-believing, Bible-preaching fundamental churches, is tremendously appealing. However, it is imperative to ask this question: ""What actually must be done in order to accomplish dynamic church growth?"" We must warn about Rick Warren's unbiblical answer to that question. The purpose of this report is not to warn or challenge mainline denominational churches or middle-of-the-road evangelical churches to accept Biblical principles regarding church growth and to gain a proper understanding of the very nature of the church. No, these groups are already committed to a course of compromise. It is not surprising that the vast majority of liberal and New Evangelical churches today readily fall for the superchurch growth strategy, for they vehemently reject Bible separation and have long since adopted theologies and ministries that do not insist upon contending for the Faith or for the inerrancy of Scripture. The Biblical counsel we would give to one who might find himself in such a church is to come out of it and follow the Lord's leading to a solid, Bible-believing, Bible-preaching, separated and militantly fundamental church.  The purpose of this report is, however, to exhort and encourage those churches that are attempting to maintain a strong, fundamentalist testimony. Our burden is for churches that are trying to stay true to the Lord and have experienced little or no growth through the years as a result of their stand for the truth. The temptation to incorporate some of the techniques of the dynamic church growth model is great. Who does not want to reach more people, draw a larger crowd or be more effective in ministry? Nevertheless, the question that every Bible-believing Christian and fundamentalist pastor should ask is ""What must be sacrificed in order to gain more members and become a 'superchurch'?"" After observing and evaluating the Saddleback Seminar, we firmly believe that if the ""Purpose-Driven Church"" model is to be followed, then fidelity to the Lord and His Word must be sacrificed in order to gain the numbers. It is important to note, however, that Warren does not say a church must be huge in order for it to be vital or healthy; rather, he believes that a church's health can be equated to its dynamic growth. So what are some of the changes that must take place for a local assembly to adopt the growth strategy of the Saddleback model? From our understanding of the plan which was clearly spelled out at the seminar, the following must occur in order to transform a traditionally-styled church of any size into one that can boast dramatic growth:  A contemporary-styled ""Seeker Service"" aimed at drawing in the unsaved and the unchurched from the community must replace the traditional Sunday worship service. To do this successfully, the church service must be non-threatening, familiar and comfortable to the ""seeker"" (the unsaved visitor).  The dress must be casual. The typical ""Saddleback Sam"" (a researched composite of the unchurched yuppie commonly found in Saddleback Church's surrounding community) dresses up for work all week, and he wants to ""dress down"" on the weekends. (As we shall see throughout this article, Saddleback Sam's likes and dislikes are what determine the style of the church service.) Attendees and church staff alike shun any ties, suits and dresses. Warren, dressed in a casual shirt, khakis and loafers told his seminar audience, ""Get comfortable. This is as dressed up as I get in this church. My idea of winter is I put on socks, and obviously I don't think it's winter yet.""  The music must be contemporary. Not only must the lyrics of the music be more recent, but the style of music should be that which the unsaved hears on a daily basis. The entertainment composite of the Saddleback sound system, band, singers and presentation would rival that of any secular rock concert. Warren stated that one of the first things a church should do is ""replace the organ with a band."" But he went on to say that if a band was not feasible, then at least a church could purchase a keyboard that will incorporate midi disks in order to give the sound of a band. Furthermore, the purpose of the church choir should be ""backing up the soloist. That's the 90's way to use a choir rather than just having them sing.""  The message must be only positive. We consider this to be the most flagrant flaw. Yes, the saved and unsaved alike can feel better about themselves after a message that often mixes psychology and an uplifting Scripture text. Such topics as dealing with guilt, self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, mood enhancement or motivation for success will encourage the worldly, weary individual. But what is God's command to the faithful undershepherd of the flock? Far, far different.  The ministries of the church must be geared to meeting the needs and special interests of the thousands who attend. Support groups for depression, eating disorders, infertility, family and friends of homosexuals, post abortion, and separated men and women were abundant. Many ministries were intended to bring together ones with similar business or professional interests, common recreational interests and so on. We could not find one single ministry listed in Saddleback Community Church's bulletin that involved the taking the Gospel message out to the lost in the community. In fact, Warren scoffed at the idea of passing out tracts or going door-to-door since ""Saddleback Sam"" is offended by such old-fashion, out-moded forms of evangelism.  Doctrinal instruction is not given to the church as a whole on the Lord's Day. Despite the fact that the early church clearly sets forth the example that doctrine is to be taught on Sunday to all the church body, at Saddleback, doctrine is only taught to sub-groups of the congregation apart from the regular church services. Warren emphasized Saddleback's strategy of moving new members ""around the bases"" by having interested Christians take special classes to prepare them for service. Although Bible study groups also meet together, our question is this: Why is not the pulpit used to proclaim the ""whole counsel of God"" to the whole congregation assembled before it on the Lord's Day (Acts 20:20-31)? Why make serious, systematic Bible instruction an option, heard only by the relatively few in the crowd who desire to ""round the next base""? The whole counsel of God is to be proclaimed, to all seated before the pulpit, all the time!  A spirit of compromise must prevail in the church that is to experience dynamic growth. The embrace of contemporary culture and style will most assuredly set the desired mood that totally opposes the Biblical mandate to earnestly contend for the faith and separate from error. What works, what is least offensive and what is positive and uplifting is what should define the ministry, according to Warren. The church leaders who are interested in dynamic growth must embrace the attitude that says, ""Don't try to tell me the Bible requires holiness and a style for worship and ministry that is different from that of the world."" This ""grace-in-your-face"" attitude is so prevalent today because of church elders who are not willing, or not aware of how, to instruct ones to behave in the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15).  Rick Warren began the seminar by revealing the vast influence his message has had throughout the world. He told the pastors and church leaders who were attending the seminar, ""You're joining a group today of over 45,000 pastors and church leaders that have gone through this conference in the last few years from about 42 different countries, from about 63 different denominations. We have a number of different countries that flew in today just for this one day conference, from Europe, from Asia, from South America."" To accent the ecumenical mood of the seminar, Warren later suggested, ""It really doesn't matter your denomination, folks. We're all on the same team if you love Jesus."" Warren's book  The Purpose Driven Church  and the related publications of Saddleback's literature ministry have influenced tens of thousands more who have never attended any of his seminars. As Warren indicated in a closing prayer, the impact of the Saddleback experience is extensive, to say the least:  ""Thank you that there is a movement, a stealth movement, that's flying beneath the radar, that's changing literally hundreds, even thousands of churches around the world.""  It is necessary for the faithful believer today to be wary of any ""stealth"" (camouflaged, secretive) program intended to fly ""beneath the radar"" in order to avoid detection. For many years now the church growth movement has certainly flown into congregations undetected by thousands of churches worldwide. The onslaught must be detected, the warning must be sounded now! This report will identify and analyze the programs suggested by the Saddleback Community Church model and will ascertain whether or not this model is consistent with what the Bible says concerning the nature, purpose and strategy of the church. Although Saddleback Community Church is one of the largest churches in America (comparable to Bill Hybels' Willow Creek Community Church), the believer must not take a pragmatic approach to church growth. While the contemporary strategies of worship and ministry employed by both Warren and Hybels seem to be successful (according to the world's standards) and do indeed attract thousands of saved and unsaved alike, results do not determine what is acceptable to the Lord -- only God's Word reveals if their methods please Him.  One of the primary problems with the Saddleback approach is that all traditional, conservative forms of music, worship and decorum in the church are abolished and subsequently replaced with new methods and styles designed after the world. The programs of this new ""superchurch"" are aimed at making the unsaved, or the ""seeker,"" feel comfortable and entertained and at meeting his temporal needs. Some Christians feel that any method of worship and evangelism is appropriate as long as the lost are being reached for Christ. Thus, they have accepted a pragmatic view of worship and evangelism -- the end justifies the means; if it works, it must be right. But believers and pastors alike must ask, ""Is the proper way in which God's people approach unto their Lord in corporate worship relative?""  The goal of the superchurch is to draw a crowd so that the crowds will, eventually, be saved and worked into the church membership. Furthermore, the core ministry of the church allows for the abandonment of everything ""traditional"" that would in any way appear to be offensive to the neighborhood ""seeker."" Are godly pastors and believers to fashion their style of service after the comforts of the unsaved ""seeker,"" or could it be that Romans 12:2 is at least somewhat applicable to the church today? God's Word clearly says, ""And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."" Rick Warren's Saddleback church growth model seems to totally contradict this portion of Scripture. This report will also make reference to the Saddleback model, as presented in the workshop, and discern whether or not God does indeed have something to say concerning the way in which believers should worship and minister. From our admittedly fundamentalist perspective, we believe that the Bible does have something to say about the style, as well as the content, of the church service. The Scriptures speak very clearly about the way in which God's people are to approach unto their God, both by way of principle and type from the Old Testament and also apostolic directive in the New Testament.  Before making our observations regarding the sessions we attended, it is needful to point out that Rick Warren has been trained as a Southern Baptist and obviously knows the Bible extremely well. He is a personable individual who is a skilled communicator of his ideas. Warren mentioned that when he developed these concepts as a young man in seminary, no one paid attention to him. However, now that the strategy obviously works, he has an extensive and eager audience. One cannot help but enjoy his presentation, even though the aftertaste is far less pleasant when more careful consideration is given to what was actually said or implied. Many of his suggestions were indeed helpful, but the main thrust of his church growth model is certainly questionable in light of God's Word. Warren encouraged his seminar attendees to view Saddleback Church as a model for their respective ministries and to use as much or as little of his strategy as they deemed worthwhile. He also said, however, that unless the main aspects of the program were incorporated (the contemporary style and positive-only content of the message, music and program) then the resultant growth would be something far less than dynamic.  Warren's plans for motivating the people, charting an organizational structure for ministry and developing a marketing strategy for building a superchurch are much like what one would hear in a secular management training seminar. In fact, during an intermission this was even mentioned in a conversation with corporate businessmen who were also in attendance. The same techniques that are used to build the base of support for a business can also be used to build a ministry's clientele. What is the key? One must provide a product that will meet the real or perceived needs of the consuming public. For Saddleback Community Church, that meant they had to determine via a survey the needs of the Saddleback community at large and then provide programs at the church to meet those needs. As a result of the survey, a composite ""Saddleback Sam,"" or unsaved church seeker, was defined, and the style and programs of the church were then redefined to meet his needs. Hence, the ministries (support and special interest groups, recreational fellowships, etc.) and the style and content of the ""Seeker Service"" were aimed at making the typical ""Saddleback Sam"" feel comfortable, helped and encouraged.  Obviously, some are skeptical of Rick Warren's novel approach to church growth, and Warren is certainly aware of such individuals. He employed effective techniques to disarm his critics by first shooting down a ""straw man"" representing an exaggerated example of the critic's position or by using humorous one-liners to side-step the criticism before his own proposition was advanced. For example, he advanced the replacement of traditional hymns and musical accompaniment with contemporary Christian rock songs and backup bands that accentuated the driving beat enjoyed by the unsaved with the following reasons: First, Warren made it clear that loud, raucous music with a driving beat is the kind of music to which Saddleback residents listened, inside and outside of the church:  Now, at Saddleback Church, we are unapologetically contemporary... I passed out a three-by-five card to everybody in the church, and I said, ""You write down the call letters of the radio station you listen to."" I wasn't even asking unbelievers. I was asking the people in the church, ""What kind of music do you listen to?"" When I got it back, I didn't have one person who said, ""I listen to organ music."" Not one. I didn't have a single person who said, ""I listen to huge choirs on the radio."" Not one. In fact, it was 96-97% adult contemporary, middle-of-the-road pop. It wasn't heavy metal rock, but it was something with a beat like you hear most commercials have today on television. So, we made a strategic decision that we are unapologetically a contemporary music church. And right after we made that decision and stopped trying to please everybody, Saddleback exploded with growth. Now, I'll be honest with you, we are loud. We are really, really loud on a weekend service.... I say, ""We're not gonna turn it down."" Now the reason why is baby boomers want to feel the music, not just hear it. Now, I can give you two dozen really good churches within driving distance that are my friends, we're in small groups together, that don't have it as loud as us. Go there. Why should every church have the same music? ... People can find that God loves variety! The bottom line of his philosophy is this: What is popular in the community, whatever style of music currently has the ear of ""Saddleback Sam,"" must be the music of the church. Church leaders can try to mix the contemporary with the traditional in the same service, or even in separate services, but Warren said doing so would be ""like kissing your sister. You could do it, but who'd want to?"" His humorous concluding statement cleverly serves to divert the attention away from the larger issue at hand -- allowing the world to determine the type of music that belongs in the house of God. Second, Warren equated insisting upon the use of traditional music in the church to the sin of idolatry. He said, You see folks, to insist that all good music came from Europe 200 years ago is thinly veiled racism, if you want to be truthful about it. It's cultural elitism saying that all the good music was written 200 years ago in Europe.... Now for 2,000 years, the Holy Spirit has used all kinds of music. And to insist that one particular style of music is more sacred than the other, there's a word for that. It's called idolatry. Idolatry. This statement is an example of one of Warren's straw men, for the use of eighteenth-century hymns is not the issue. The question at hand is whether music intended to appeal to the flesh should be used in the church. Much fine and worshipful music penned in this present century is being used in Bible-believing churches today. Style is the issue here, not the century in which the songs were written. The words or message are not what get the place ""rocking"" on Saturday evening or Sunday morning; it is the arrangement and the orchestration.  Warren claims the Bible says nothing regarding the style of music, only its content. But if the unsaved and saved alike are attracted to a church by its style of music, then how can such a response (which is obviously based upon a fleshly appeal) possibly communicate a message that will edify the spiritual inner man? Can a response of the flesh produce a truly spiritual effect within? Study Galatians 5:16-26 and see if there is not a contradiction of forces at work here. Reverence in praising God will never appeal to the unregenerate, but it certainly will prepare the believer for worshipping God ""in the beauty of holiness"" (1 Chron. 16:29) and receiving ""with meekness the engrafted word"" (Jas. 1:21). Third, Warren's supposed Biblical justification for using contemporary music is sorely deficient. Warren told his audience, The Bible says in Psalm 40:3, ""He put a new song in my mouth; many people will see this and worship Him. Then they will trust the Lord."" Notice the parallel or the correlation between music, worship, and evangelism. It says, ""Then they will trust the Lord."" Now there's a word that I want you to circle in that sentence; it's the word N-E-W. The same old tired songs are not gonna reach anybody...but a new song says, ""God is doing something new in our midst."" Dear reader, to what is the psalmist referring when he uses the term new? First of all, remember that Warren said the Bible has absolutely nothing to say about the style of music or worship, so according to his own logic, this verse cannot possibly refer to a contemporary, ""new"" melody or current lyrics. No, David is talking about the new song that comes forth from one of God's redeemed saints. The Holy Spirit touches the heart of the believer to respond by song in a way the unsaved can never experience, much less desire; this spiritual song is not something the unbeliever can ""get into."" If the Lord is to be worshipped ""in spirit and in truth"" (Jn. 4:24), then only those who have been washed in the Blood can truly sing this ""new"" song. Warren intimates that the unsaved are turned off by the ""golden oldies,"" the ""blasts from the past,"" as he refers to the old hymns. When a believer stops to think about it, the unbeliever's dislike for hymns is understandable. The songs of worship and praise for the Lord obviously only appeal to the spirit of the regenerated man (Rom. 8:16) because the focus is upon the Lord, not man's flesh. If believers cannot see an unreconcilable dichotomy between fleshly and spiritual music, then further study on the holiness of God is advised. What does Warren say regarding those in the church who oppose the switch from conservative to contemporary in order to bring in the crowds? He stated in no uncertain terms that the old stalwarts would have to go: Be willing to let people leave the church. And I told you earlier the fact that people are gonna leave the church no matter what you do. But when you define the vision, you're choosing who leaves. You say, ""But Rick, yes, they're the pillars of the church."" Now, you know what pillars are. Pillars are people who hold things up ... And in your church, you may have to have some blessed subtractions before you have any real additions. How terribly sad! We have heard from many dear, godly, older saints (and some discerning younger believers as well!) who are heartsick about what happened to their churches after the leaders attended Saddleback seminars. Invariably, these now-dispensable saints have a spiritual maturity and an awareness of Bible truth that is obvious. Yet, instead of their church recognizing the place and blessedness of such believers in the local body of Christ (see Titus 2:1-15), they are brushed off to the side, told to come only to the ""more traditional"" mid-week service or frankly told to move on and find another church. Because Warren is located in the Southern California area, he mentioned that he often refers others (either visitors or dissenters) to such churches as Robert Schuller's Crystal Cathedral or Jack Hayford's Church on the Way.  No doubt Warren has been criticized by denominational leaders who recoil at his strong suggestion that denominational ""labels"" should be abolished (thus, Saddleback Community Church, the People's Church, Willow Creek Community Church, etc.). This is common to ecumenical endeavors which minimize doctrinal differences. Warren feels that terms like  Baptist, Bible, Presbyterian,  etc. might unduly offend some or unnecessarily narrow the group of those who would visit: The unchurched hang-ups determine our strategy....We found a hang-up about denominational labels. I went out. I went door to door and said, ""What do you think of when I say 'Southern Baptist'?"" They said, ""You don't want to know."" ...So, we chose a neutral name. Why? Well, it wasn't a theological decision, a compromise. It was an evangelistic strategy decision because we wanted to reach out. Interestingly, Warren worked into his presentation the fact that the Southern Baptist traditionalists evidently smile on his approach. Notice what he said concerning his meeting with several Southern Baptist notables: Once a year the pastors of the twenty-five largest Southern Baptist churches get together, and we hole up in a hotel for two or three days and just talk about our churches. All these churches are running at least 2,000 in attendance. And it's people like Adrian Rodgers and Charles Stanley and Ed Young and just all kinds of guys you may have heard or may have never heard of....we were sitting in a room together with all these people, and they said, ""Rick, take a couple hours and just tell us about Saddleback. What's going on?"" Sitting catty-corner to me -- I was a little nervous about this -- sitting catty-corner to me was Dr. W. A. Criswell....for two hours I'm just telling what's going on at Saddleback. And here's W. A. Criswell in his seventies taking notes as fast as he could, writing things down, writing things down. And I walked out of there, and I started crying. I was so humbled by that experience, and I realized why he was a great man. He'd never stopped learning. This account was not given to merely express Warren's humility; it was to authenticate his church growth strategy by revealing that the respected experts, the ""denominational giants,"" accepted his methods. Furthermore, this was a subtle hint to his audience that if even W. A. Criswell felt he needed to learn from Warren on how to minister and grow a superchurch, then certainly each of the 3,500 church leaders attending the seminar also needed to take careful notes. Rick Warren made it expressly known that if one wants growth, dynamic growth, then he must do it this ""Saddleback"" way, but if that person decides to stay in the conservative, traditional mode, his ministry and church will wither on the vine.  The church growth/church marketing strategy has had a great impact upon the churches of this land and around the world, and it will be even much more pervasive in the days ahead. What church does not want to grow -- dramatically and dynamically!? In this article, we are not trying to question the motives of those who design and those who adopt dynamic church growth methods. It is the methods themselves that we condemn. Warren candidly said, The unchurched culture determines our style. We're laid back Southern California. We're just a few miles from the beach, so we have a laid back Southern California style....Regardless of the style you choose, you're going to be criticized. Okay? So, the key question is, ""Who are you trying to impress?"" The unchurched populations determine our goals. Are we to seek to impress the world? Is the world to determine the strategy of the church? Christ warned that the world would hate the church, not admire it (Jn. 15:18). The Word, not the world, is to determine the strategy of the church.  Even though Warren would probably protest this observation, the fact remains the same -- the message, not just the methods, dramatically changes when one employs the purpose-driven church strategy. The Bible commands that the ""whole counsel of God"" be preached in the church; that necessarily includes preaching the negative as well as the positive and having a pulpit ministry that obeys God's call to equip the saints to go out into the world and to be ""ambassadors for Christ"" in reaching the lost in the community. A ""feel-good message"" appealing to saint and seeker alike does not fulfill God's command to ""contend for the faith,"" ""reprove, rebuke and exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine"" and ""warn of the wolves in sheep's clothing."" Where in the Bible does it say the church's ministry is to meeting the psychological, emotional and interpersonal relationship needs of the unsaved? Such a philosophy cannot be found in God's Word. The traditional church service has tried to equip the saint for service and witness and to foster a spirit of reverence in the worship and adoration of the Lord. We believe there is Biblical justification for this design, or ""style,"" of worship. Warren says that if one wants dynamic growth, he must choose between the traditional or the inventive, contemporary, user-friendly church like that of Saddleback Community. Our concern is that thousands are indeed opting for the latter, and we believe the Bible gives us some reasons why that choice is wrong. A quote from John Moffat's book  All Truth God's Truth?  seems to be particularly fitting for the Saddleback strategy of designing the church's service after the contemporary worldly context: I can imagine Nadab and Abihu talking before the early worship service in the wilderness. One says to the other, ""All fire is God's fire. God made all fire; therefore it is all of Him."" Or while Moses was up on Mount Sinai, the children of Israel could have said to Aaron, ""All worship of god is God's worship."" These analogies have the same deceptive sound of being logical at first glance, but they are full of the same ambiguity and deceit as the expression ""all truth is God's truth."" Rick Warren made the statement, ""I don't think God cares two bits about your style of worship as long as it's in spirit and in truth."" Is he correct? The terms  spirit  and  truth  must first be defined in a Biblical context. When worshipping the Lord, man's spirit is to be moved only by the Holy Spirit of God (not his _esh); furthermore, worship is to be in truth which means it can only be defined according to what God's Holy Word says (not what man says). The Bible says that worship is to be practiced in holiness and reverence -- these qualities of ""style"" are not subjective! If the methods of worship were totally relative to the individual, then the demonstration of ""spirit"" and ""truth"" in worship would mean absolutely nothing -- there would be no way to distinguish the church from the social institutions of the unregenerate world. No, the Bible says the people of God are to be holy, as He is holy. They are to be a ""peculiar people,"" ""a light set upon the hill""; they are noticeably different from the world. Thus, Warren's statement is not correct; God does indeed care about one's ""style"" in worship and methodology. Our worship is to be patterned after the likeness of Christ Himself and in accordance with the principles set forth in the eternal, unalterable Word of Truth.  First Chronicles 16:29 says, ""Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness."" Is ""holiness"" subjective to the individual? Absolutely not -- only God is holy; therefore, the characteristics of holiness are found in the Lord, not man. Many examples and direct statements in God's Word guide the believer in his worship and in his witness away from the course of this present evil age. The qualifications of holiness are invariably different from the world; thus, holy worship includes both reverence and separation from a worldly style.  Notice the New Testament counterpart for the Lord's people in the church: 1 Timothy 6:11-14 says,  But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. I give thee charge in the sight of God... That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. First Peter 1:13-19 and Peter 2:5, 9 furthermore provide believers in the Church Age with commands that must be considered when defining purpose: Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: [NOT stylizing our current walk after the former unsaved, worldly walk] But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.... Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Who comprises the local church? The church is to meet together on the Lord's Day, the first day of the week; we find that the local New Testament church consisted of believers who met together for worship, fellowship, instruction and edification. First Corinthians 3:16-17 tells us that the church is the temple of God. When believers gather together as a local church, they must view themselves as the dwelling place of God and must realize that it is a place where man and God meet together for fellowship. The local body of believers, the church, is the temple of the all-holy God. Ephesians 4:11-12 clearly shows that God gave individual leaders of the local church (pastors and teachers) special gifts for a particular purpose -- ""For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ."" The local church is not an organization that is ordained by God to conform to the world in order to reach the lost. No, the purpose of the local church is to worship God, to grow in His grace and knowledge and to train the individual believers in the Word so that they might better reach the lost for Christ and be a testimony to the world. They are to be different from the world -- patterned after Christ -- not imitating or conforming to the world.  One of the most revealing slogans used by Warren to show what must occur in any church in order for growth to result is this: ""Never confuse the method with the message. The message must never change, but the methods must change!"" Is it true that Saddleback Community Church has not changed its proclamation to the thousands assembled beneath its pulpit? What about Willowcreek Community Church and other contemporary, dynamic-growth ministries? No, these mega-churches have indeed changed the message -- they have departed significantly from the Biblical mandate regarding the declaration of the whole counsel of God to be proclaimed by the elders/pastors of the faithful New Testament church. The message has clearly changed, and Warren's own words prove it: Read Scripture from a newer translation. And as you read that Scripture, realize that you're trying to pick out Scriptures that appeal especially to baby boomers. And try to find Scriptures that specifically relate to the benefits that Christ can bring into a person's life. They've never heard the Scripture before, so try to pick positive Scriptures that talk about the benefits of Christ... you want to pick out Scriptures that are very positive. Choosing only ""positive texts"" to preach on the Lord's Day (or on Saturday evenings for those churches that desire to make the services more ""convenient"") and using only ""positive texts"" to define the purposes of the church (of the 41 ""verses that relate to the purposes of the church"" listed in the seminar workbook, none were included which dealt with insistence upon warning, doctrine, etc.; none were from Acts 20, Romans 16, 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus, 2 Peter, Jude or Revelation) result in a glaring deficiency in one's message. Vitally important texts dealing specifically with the church's doctrine, message and ministry must be ignored in order to maintain positive-only preaching.  Indeed, the message does change! Notice the following quote from a revealing essay entitled ""Does Theology Still Matter?"" by Gary L. W. Johnson in the book  The Coming Evangelical Crisis: Although most of today's professing evangelicals would acknowledge that theology, in some sense of the word, does matter, a recent survey in Christianity Today revealed that this is more lip service than anything else. According to this survey...theology, in any sense of the word, is really not all that important to the very people to whom it should matter most: those in the pew and in the pulpit. Both groups listed theological knowledge as last in terms of pastoral priorities....We are sadly experiencing, on a rather large scale, a subjectivism that betrays its weakened hold on the objective truth and reality of Christianity by its neglect or even renunciation of its distinctive objective character....Men...really wish to have a creedless Christianity. ""Creeds,"" they shout, ""are divisive things; away with them!""...Where does this leave us? An undogmatic Christianity is no Christianity at all. (Moody Press, 1996, pp. 58, 66, 67) What does the Bible say about the purpose of the church worship service and what the faithful pastor must preach to the ""crowd"" (as Warren describes it) that assembles each Sunday? No doubt Saddleback Church leaders would be quick to point out that the four Christian education classes available to the congregation do deal with doctrine. However, the Bible is clear that doctrine is to be faithfully proclaimed on the Lord's Day through the pulpit ministry of the pastors/elders. Providing optional training, apart from the instruction given from the pulpit, cannot side-step what God intends the public church service to be. The Saddleback seminar said that only positive Bible texts should be used from the pulpit, but God's Word says something quite different. The apostle Paul had very straightforward directives for the elders of the Ephesian church regarding their ministry, and the same is essential today. Acts 20:20-31 says, ... I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.... For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. Was the apostle's instruction negative? Yes, but certainly also necessary! Many of the duties that the Lord requires of faithful pastors and teachers are found in texts that were ""overlooked"" by the Saddleback workbook. Whatever text came across as negative was obviously passed over. Another such text is Titus 1:3-11:  [God] hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour.... For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: ... [Hold] fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers [those who contradict or speak against the truth of God]. For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: Whose mouths must be stopped.... Second Timothy 3:16-4:5 gives further instruction regarding the purpose for the church; this text was also ignored by Saddleback's dynamic growth strategy: All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers [those who will not practice the above], having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. Are you identified with a church that is led by faithful undershepherds who are committed to obeying these commands? Are they willing to contend for the faith and warn their people - from the pulpit? Or is it a ""positive-only"" message? We must stand only with those willing to obey these essentials for faithful ministry.  The Saddleback strategy is, again, to design the weekend ""Seeker Service,"" the programs and the support ministries of the church in order to attract the unsaved in the community. According to the strategy, the ""seeker"" must want to come to church; therefore, the services must be designed in such a way that he will be comfortable, entertained and find the answers to his problems as he perceives them. Warren teaches that the ministry of the church must be stylized after those things to which the unsaved are accustomed -- whether that style includes the language used, the music performed, the casual attire worn or even the message proclaimed from the pulpit. The character, the style and the contemporary interests of the unregenerate community are what determine the makeup, the appearance and the content of the weekend services.  The following comments by Rick Warren reveal Saddleback's ""Biblical"" justification for making the church ""user friendly"" to the unsaved:  Now Paul's evangelism strategy was this: 1 Corinthians 9 -- ""To the Jew I became like a Jew to win the Jews. In the same way with the Gentiles, I became like a Gentile in order to win the Gentiles. I have become all things to all men that I may save some of them by any means possible."" He's saying, ""Adapt to the situation God puts you in."" Today, he'd say, ""When in Southern California, become like a Southern Californian to reach Southern Californians."" Let us take a closer look at this portion of Scripture found in 1 Corinthians 9. First, the apostle is  not  defining in this text the purpose and character of the worship service of the local church. Instead, this discourse is the personal testimony of Paul, the evangelistically-minded missionary, as he took the message of Christ to the lost in their respective communities, cultures and circumstances. Second, the ""assembling together of the saints"" on the first day of the week, Sunday, was for the purpose of being built up in the faith, of giving attendance to the ""reading [of the Scriptures], to exhortation [the charge to continue in God's truth], to doctrine [the teaching of 'all the counsel of God']"" -- 1 Timothy 4:13. The overwhelming volume of instruction in the epistles was given to the elders of the churches and to ones such as Timothy and Titus who were to ""set in order the things which are wanting"" (Titus 1:5). This apostolic instruction had to do with what the Christian was to believe and how he was to ""behave [himself] in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth"" (1 Tim. 3:15). For Warren to suggest that the church's purpose is to provide common ground for the ""seeker"" and present him only positive Biblical texts that speak to his emotional, psychological and inter-personal ""needs"" is absolutely ludicrous! The pastor is to preach the Word - all of It - or It ceases to be ""the pillar and ground of the truth""! The purpose of 1 Corinthians 9 is not to define the church's worship service, but rather it details the resolute purpose and godly motivation of the apostle Paul to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all, Jew and Gentile, bond or free, regardless of the ethnic, cultural or social standing the lost might have. Paul had no target group! All needed to be saved, and he dedicated himself to going out to meet the lost in their situation, but never at the expense of being anything less than what God called him to be, and that was to be ""holy, even as I [God] am holy."" Second Corinthians 5:14-21 confirms Paul's selfless, evangelistic purpose: For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: [Christ died for all; all need to be saved; we seek to win all] ... Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Paul was willing to be a servant to all so that he might present Christ to all, regard  "

You were made to last forever!

You must begin with God, your Creator, and his reasons for creating you. You were made by God and for God, and until you understand that, life will never make sense.    This book will help you understand why you are alive and God's amazing plan for you?both here and now, and for eternity.  Rick Warren  will guide you through a personal 40-day spiritual journey that will transform your answer to life's most important question: What on earth am I here for? Knowing God's purpose for creating you will reduce your stress, focus your energy, simplify your decisions, give meaning to your life, and, most importantly, prepare you for eternity.    The Purpose Driven? Life is a blueprint for Christian living in the 21st century?a lifestyle based on God's eternal purposes, not cultural values. Using over 1,200 ural quotes and references, it challenges the conventional definitions of worship, fellowship, discipleship, ministry, and evangelism. In the tradition of Oswald Chambers,  Rick Warren  offers distilled wisdom on the essence of what life is all about.     This is a book of hope and challenge that you will read and re-read, and it will be a classic treasured bygenerations to come.

Its really captured both our lives and had made a difference, so we can make a difference.       Loved It!    October 18, 2006                         Reviewer:  Anonymous  from Hawaii         This was the first christian book that ive read, besides the bible, and i thought it was a great way to kick start my life to focus on God. It made me see things a lot clearer as far as what i should do with my life and how God is calling me. The daily readings are maybe average 6-7 pages. It will make you have a completely different perspective towards the world and the way you are as an individual. Life on earth is a temporary assignment, its not our final destination, we should live to fill our mission from God. This is an amazing book!       Changed My Mind    September 1, 2006                         Reviewer:  David Costa  from NC         When I finished reading through this book, you could not get to shut up about all the things that I learned.    My eyes got wider and stronger with each word that I read.  It also left a few thousand hand prints on my face from all the slaps it delivered.       Great Book!  A Must Have!    February 7, 2006                         Reviewer:  Kelly  from Fresno, CA.         I learned so much about myself through this book.  It changed my life!  God has a plan for me!!       Must reading    December 28, 2005                         Reviewer:  Anonymous  from Utah         I am not a total enthusiast of this book because it espouses some non christian doctrines, but is a popular read. I give it a 3 out 5.        Great way to start the day!    November 6, 2005                         Reviewer:  Brad  from Canada         If you feel your morning devotions arent really doing much for you, check out this book and youll see that you mean more to God than you knew, and youre here for a reason!       Purpose Driven Life    August 28, 2005                         Reviewer:  M  from Minnesota         There have been a number of negative comments, though plenty of positive too, but i think it shows how much opposition one receives when writing something with the impact that this book has. unfortunately, the old religious arm that wants to determine standards outside of God rears its ugly head when someone acts through the Holy Spirit.  I thought it was too basic for me at first, but picking it up at a friend's house, i started to read again, and find how much it helps to be reminded again of the significance of my life in God's plan.  Warren says he used over a thousand scriptures and, in my opinion, wisely chose many different translations, because, as he points out, the original writings were in Hebrew and Greek and many words are lost when it goes into English! So, since the Word says that all scripture is profitable for teaching and training in righteousness, all of the Word he uses alone has such power.        Purpose Driven Life    July 26, 2005                         Reviewer:  Anonymous  from USA         Shows the purpose of life, to worship God!  Leads to a great walk with God.       special    July 13, 2005                         Reviewer:  Benjamin  from NY         He elaborates on five truths to answer this question of why we are here. According to Warren, we exist for the purposes of worship, ministry, evangelism, fellowship and discipleship. He states that in fulfilling these roles on earth, we find and fulfill our purposes.   This is a comprehensive book about how to live the Christian life successfully. It discusses most of the major themes of The Bible. Warren cites over 1,000 scriptures in the book. He rarely makes a point without quoting from the Bible. The messages of the chapters are relevant for new and mature Christians.         Eye Opening    July 7, 2005                         Reviewer:  Lindsey  from california         While I keep hearing controversy surrounding this book i have to say as of yet i cant find any of it honestly credible. The bible verses seem to follow along with what he is trying to say and although some of my favorite speakers seem to have a problem with it i have found nothing but useful information on living a life filled with purpose. There are a lot of issues in this book that touch the heart such as you are not a mistake, its not about you its about god, what it really means to worship and others, i really reccomend this book to anyone who is looking to broaden their ideas about how God looks at life-it is a real eye opener especially in today's world and in American culture.

What's Wrong with Rick Warren?   Evaluating the Author of the Purpose-Driven Life   ©   Brian Tubbs   Jan 2, 2009       What's wrong with Rick Warren? Liberal critics call him intolerant, while others say he's superficial, deceptive, or too soft on sin. Who is the real Rick Warren?     Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in California and bestselling author of  The Purpose-Driven Life , has emerged as one of the most popular evangelical preachers in modern history. And President-elect Barack Obama has placed him, once again, in the spotlight.   Rick Warren and Barack Obama   The latest controversy surrounding the Saddleback pastor is that President-elect Barack Obama has selected him to give the invocation at the January 20 inauguration. Gay rights organizations and pro-choice activists have condemned the choice, given Warren's stand against same-sex marriage and for the sanctity of human life.   In spite of the backlash, Obama has stood firm on his choice, saying that it's important for Americans to disagree agreeably and for the country to come together.   Obama and Warren go back a ways. When the former U.S. senator from Illinois (now incoming President) was gearing up for his run at the White House, Warren invited him to a forum at Saddleback Church, a move that helped raise Obama's profile and his standing with evangelicals. During the campaign, Warren maintained ties with Obama and declined to endorse Republican John McCain, even though many like-minded evangelical leaders did not hesitate to criticize Obama and side with McCain.   Yet Obama's pick of Warren has not sat well with many liberal and Democratic Party activists. They have accused Obama of ""disrespect"" and have applied considerable pressure for the President-elect to reconsider his invitation to the California pastor.   Rick Warren on Gays   The Human Rights Campaign, in a letter to President-elect Obama, called Warren ""one of the architects and promoters of an anti-gay agenda."" The Human Rights Campaign identified the passage of Proposition 8, the California initiative that invalidated same-sex marriage and which Warren publicly supported, as ""the greatest loss our community has faced in 40 years.""   Many gay rights activists were shocked and outraged at Warren's support for Proposition 8, given his past support for AIDS research and charity work toward AIDS victims. Indeed, Warren's work on behalf of AIDS victims involved significant cooperation with non-Christian organizations. But observant gay activists were not as shocked. As blogger Kathryn Joyce points out: ""Warren has made clear that his collaboration with non-evangelical AIDS activists wouldn't lead him to compromise on his biblical convictions.""   Joyce, who blogs for the pro-choice RH Reality Check website, meant that statement as a criticism, but Warren and his followers would no doubt embrace it as a compliment. Of course, Joyce says much more about Warren. She categorizes his activism as ""anti-choice"" and ""anti-gay,"" and indeed regards his entire AIDS approach as ""troubling"" in that it promotes abstinence and ""entangles religion and treatment.""   Rick Warren and the Bible   So, what's the verdict on Warren? Is Rick Warren a homophobe? Is Warren a man of hate? Is he intolerant?   Mary Sanchez, writing for  The Kansas City Star , says that Rick Warren ""needs to evolve."" She calls Warren an ""old-time religionist with old-time beliefs about issues on which American attitudes have, so to speak, evolved.""   Perhaps much of society has ""evolved"" in their views concerning abortion, homosexuality, marriage, and so forth. But do human beings even  possess  the right or authority to ""evolve"" when it comes to religion or morality? If the Bible is the Word of God and if it categorizes homosexuality as a sin, then does that not settle the matter? (See "" The Bible on Gay Marriage ,"" which addresses this question).   When Abraham Lincoln was once asked if he thought God was on the side of the North in the American Civil War, Lincoln responded: ""Sir, my concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God's side.""   Likewise, Warren's critics need to be less concerned about Rick Warren and more concerned about God. It is, after all, up to God as to whether abortion, homosexuality, or any other controversial issue is right or wrong. It is up to God and no one else. And if Rick Warren believes God has decided the moral question of same-sex marriage, then his convictions (both private and in public) should reflect that.

Rosa sat so Martin could walk. Martin walked so Obama could run. Obama ran so our children could fly.     I send this via BCC to keep your emails private, but I wanted to share this truly historic and momentous occasion with friends.  Some of you may have received this via email, sorry, but not everyone I know reads the bowl.   This moment transcends your party affiliation, vote, race, creed, nationality, religion, political perspectives (thanks gbarberi), or any other bond you use to separate yourself from others. This day is the true realization of our Founding Father’s America; a successful result of a grand democratic experiment we call the United States of America.   America began in 1776 with the philosophies of individual rights and the right of revolution to “ institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness “.  In December 1865 it evolved further when Abraham Lincoln ended slavery and the words “All men are created equal…” became more pronounced and true. America further manifested its destiny in 1920 with women’s suffrage which shed the confines of what “men” means under the law and country.     It wasn’t until December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks decided that no one was above her, white or black, so that she would have to give up her seat and not rest her tired feet. From that time till the march on Washington that Rev Martin Luther King Jr. laid out his vision for America, where a man would be judged, not by the color of his skin, but the content of his character. A man’s character has been put on the national stage, judged, and passed.   On the eve of November 4th, 2008 we have reached another milestone in this country’s rich history. We have reached a point that should show everyone that its not the color of our skin that binds and defines us, but our flag and our founding principles.   I hope this helps us shed our prejudices and reins in a new era of equality of the likes we haven’t seen since the great Martin Luther King promoted on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. I hope that any racial preconceptions and vices we’ve harbored for the last 40 years can be cast away, and our country can progress in its principles to bring people from all walks of life, international origin , and religion together for the betterment of us all.   My friends, we have witnessed change. For better or worse, regardless of this president elect’s future record, on November 5th you have woken up into a new country; a better country. This is a country I’ve been waiting for and one I was unsure if I would see in my lifetime. A point where anyone in this great country can really and truly be who they set out to be.   It is truly an honor to share this moment in history with you all (even those who did not vote for Obama). It is a great thing to share this moment of unity that has not been preceded by tragedy (e.g 9/11). WE came out in record numbers to vote; all of us. And for those who were ineligible to vote, your thoughts and hopes were not in vain.   Brian.   P.S. Excuse the grammatical errors, but I’ve been celebrating.    We hold these truths to be  self-evident , that  all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their  Creator  with certain  unalienable Rights , that among these are  Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the  consent of the governed , That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the  Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute  Despotism , it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

For our next trick, however, let’s see if we can all transcend our political perspectives.                    adam  on     Nov 5th, 2008   at 7:25 am              What a wonderful and inspiring text! It was about time that current era of Bush-Cheney terror and lies ends. BRAVO to all American voters to make changes possible!                   sime on     Nov 6th, 2008   at 1:27 am              Thats racist.                   sime on     Nov 6th, 2008   at 1:30 am              I thought this race wasnt about color of skin. So much for 2 years worth of dont use color of skin to run this presidential race.                   MixxingBowl Admin on     Nov 6th, 2008   at 5:59 am              @sime   http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aracist&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a   Please outline the section or sections that are racist.    I do no think that word means what you think it means. Talking about race and having a civil discord about a persons race is not racist…its called healthy conversation.  For this post to be racist, I would have had to demean, slander, make derogatory comments, and be ignorant to the world around me and not realize that there are people different than myself.   This election was not about race, it was about electing the most qualified individual for the job given the situation at hand. The person elected, happened to be black.  His race is not the point of contention, nor is it the reason he’s in office.  However, that DOES NOT excuse anyone or history to marginalize the barrier that was broken.    It sounds like you need to do several things.    1.) Find out what racism is.  2.) Get over the fact that your team was not elected.  Based on your comment, its easy to find that out.  3.) Learn to be more secure about race, it would seem that someone should look in the mirror before “finding” racism in another.  4.)  Try this kind of trolling, because its not working out for you on the web.  5.) Get out in the world.  You can leave your town and/or state to see different people.  There are 50 to choose from so you don’t have to panic yourself about leaving the borders of America.                    cGt2099  on     Nov 6th, 2008   at 2:47 pm              sime = Obvious troll is obvious                    adam  on     Nov 8th, 2008   at 6:13 am              I am still in a kind of trans, because of that fantastic result of American election…the wisdom has finally won in the USA!!!                    EVILmonkey  on     Nov 10th, 2008   at 8:10 pm              sime is obviously a hater.   I have to admit though that every time I pass a McCain/Palin sign, I have to resist the urge to spray-paint “HA HA”.  I don’t because that’s something THEY would do.                    One Weekly Gun  on     Nov 12th, 2008   at 10:21 am              I think the election WAS about race amonst other things. At least for some. Apart from being perceived as the most qualified and ready candidate for the job, Obama surely got extra points in some camps for having the skin color he has.

And after a pretty grueling day, we got back to the hotel, and I flipped on the TV and there you were talking about how a ""Purpose Driven Life"" had been used by Ashley to convince Brian to turn himself in.  And so, I actually heard about it through you.          KING:  What was your first reaction?          WARREN:  Well, I was, of course, humbled by that.  I was thrilled at it.  I had mixed emotions in the fact that first I felt sorry for those who had already lost their lives and loved ones that were left behind.  And I prayed for them and expressed my condolences for them, because I just wish the message had got there sooner, that maybe Brian wouldn't have taken four lives before he got the good news.  But I was thrilled that Ashley was able to have the presence of mind to talk to him.  And when he got the concept, it changed his life.          KING:  You're coming to us from the Saddleback Church in Cali -- in Lake Forest, right?  That's your -- that's your home church, right?         WARREN:  Right.  That's right.  I'm here in my office in Southern California getting ready to do 12 Easter services right in a row for about 40,000 people.  So, we're going to a busy week this week.          KING:  Have you spoken to Ashley?          WARREN:  Oh, yes.  I'm talking to her on a daily basis and basicly just giving her pastoral encouragement, that's what -- praying with her, reading a scripture, helping to sort out what's happened to her.  And -- these kind of things, I've helped a lot of people before, that they have a crisis and then, of course, after the crisis comes, the media deluge.  And it can be pretty unsettling to everybody.  And so, I'm just helping her behind the scenes.          KING:  Did you call her from Africa?          WARREN:  No, I wasn't able to contact her because I was out of contact both by Internet and by phone most of the time I was there.  I did send an E-mail to her and then we set up a meeting to talk.  She was anxious to talk as soon as I got back into town and then we've been doing that.          KING:  Did you know her before this?          WARREN:  No.  No, I had never met her.  I know one of her pastors who was in the church she attends, and it's a purpose driven church. That's -- they had being through, actually, the 40 days of Purpose Driven Program when this happened.  And so, she had been watching me on videotape once a week in her small group, not just reading the book.  I think she was going through it for the third time, so she was pretty well familiar with the material.          KING:  When she went public for the first time, Rick, she explained to reporters what led her to read from your book.  Lets take a look at what she said.        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)        ASHLEY SMITH, FORMER HOSTAGE:  I asked him if I could read.  He said, what do wouldn't to read?  I said, well, I have a book in my room.  So, I went and got it.  I got my Bible.  Then I got a book called ""The Purpose Driven Life.""  I turned it to a chapter that I was on that day, which was chapter 33.  And I started to read the first paragraph of it.  After I read it, he said, stop, will you read it again?  So, I read it again to him.          He mentioned something about what you thought your purpose in life was, what were you -- what talents were you given?  What gifts were you given to use?  I asked him what he thought?  And he said, I think that it's to talk to people and tell them, you know, about you.          (END VIDEO CLIP)        KING:  Would you minister to Brian Nichols, if asked?          WARREN:  I haven't had a chance to talk to Brian yet, but it is my desire to get in touch with him and kind of see where he is spiritually and you know, how we could help him too.  You know, that chapter that she chose, Larry, as you know, the book is divided into 40 days.  And she happened to just be on day 33, which is about being a servant.  And she read that passage.       And the bottom line is, when people understand that their life is not an accident, that they were made to last forever, that God put them here for a purpose.  That there are accidental parents, but I don't believe there are any accidental children.  There are illegitimate parents, but I don't believe there are any illegitimate children.  If you're alive, there's a purpose for your life.  As she began to talk about this and read the passage on serving, it just clicked with Brian.  And actually, then she modeled it.  She served him, by serving him breakfast and then actually receipted by serving her by fixing some kind of...        KING:  Curtains.          WARREN:  Curtains -- exactly, that she needed fixed.  And something keyed in there.  I think part of it was that Ashley understands grace.  You know, she has been real honest about her past. And she had some problems, she had some difficulties -- had some mistakes in her life.  And you know, when you've experienced grace and you feel like you've been forgiven, you're a lot more forgiving of other people.  You're a lot more gracious to others.  And she just showed this guy kindness, and he responded to it.          KING:  How -- how is she doing?  Is her mood uplifting?  She's not doing any media, so you'll be a link for us.  How is she doing? We're all so interested in her.        WARREN:  Well, she'll doing really good right now.  And I think, there just some people around who are protecting her, making sure she's not just overwhelmed.  Obviously, this is the story of the week, and actually, the story of the month.  And she wanted to keep her sanity.  She's got -- she's a single mother.  She's got a young child, Paige is 5-years-old.  And I think she's doing really good.  As, I said, I talked to her today, again, and asked her, I said, how are you doing?  And she said, well, I feel like God used me.  And I, of course, believed that.          You know, this guy was acting in -- when he started killing people, when Brian Nichols started killing people -- when people lack hope, they do hopeless things.  And I think this guy actually felt hopeless.  And so, he was lashing out, not in a good way.  Obviously, he took four lives and we're sorry for that.          But what people are looking for is a reason for hope.  And when Ashley explained to him, you know what, this is not what you're meant to do, this is not what you're meant to live for, he immediately resonated from it and actually called her -- said you're an angel sent from God.  And the change was instant.          KING:  Can he still have, in his situation, a purpose driven life?          WARREN:  Absolutely.  Now, there's no doubt that the Bible teaches when someone commits a crime, that the government has the authority to punish people for it.  And he may losses his life, he may get the death penalty.  But before -- as long as he's alive here on earth, there will be a purpose for his life.  And of course, that purpose now becomes greater -- and in fact, I think that's really what the message this week of Easter is, is that God can bring good out of bad.          That he turns crucifixions into resurrections.  That he takes the mess of our life, and when we give him all the pieces, he can -- God can put it together in a new way.  And the message, I think there's two messages out of this story.  One of them is, that God can use anybody.  Ashley will tell you, she's just an ordinary person.  She wasn't some saint.  She wasn't some preacher or some theologian.  God uses normal ordinary people in daily life.  And if God only used perfect people, nothing would get done.  Because none of us are perfect.  We've all got our faults, mistakes in our backgrounds.          And I think, that's the story that God uses us in spite of ourselves, in spite of ourselves, and in spite of weaknesses and faults.  And I think the other thing is, that opportunities are all around us, but a lot of times we're just unaware of it.  Everybody wants to serve God in a great way.  But in that chapter, I talk about, why don't you just serve God in a little way and watch what he wants to do.          And she, obviously, she just went out for a pack of cigarettes. And as she went out, I'm sure she didn't have any plan of being some kind of savior or super person.  But she just went out for some cigarettes, and when she came back, the opportunity presented itself and she responded in love to this guy and he melted.          KING:  More with Rick Warren.  He's on for the full hour.  We'll be including your phone calls, don't go away.          (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)        SMITH:  He said he thought that I was an angel sent from God. And that I was his sister and he was my brother in Christ.  And that he was lost and God led him right to me.          (END VIDEO CLIP)        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)        KING:  Our guest is Rick Warren, author of ""The Purpose-Driven Life,"" his first live prime-time appearance since the incredible Ashley Smith story.  Is her fame an opportunity, or can there be dangers in that?         WARREN:  Well, that's a good question, Larry.  I believe that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And fame is not for our own benefit, or notoriety is not for our own benefit, it's for leverage to do good.  And I think Ashley is definitely doing good with her life, I think she is an inspiration for a lot of people.          You know, this was simply a young woman who was going about her daily life, and she showed courage.  I'm sure she was scared to death when Brian took her captive and made her a hostage.  But courage is doing the right thing in spite of your fear.  And she, instead of seeing this guy as a monster, just thought, well, how can I -- how can I see him as a person?  And as she began to meet his needs, he began to become more of a human being.  And I think that's an example for all of us, that even the most monstrous person that -- I've discovered that hurt people hurt people.  That when you're hurting inside, you tend to hurt other people.  And clearly, he was doing that.  He was lashing out against the world in a very dangerous way.          KING:  It's got to make you feel very good and very proud, aren't you?         WARREN:  Well, I'm humbled by the whole thing.  I'm not surprised by it, actually, because I've received thousands and thousands of letters literally from all around the world of people's lives who have been changed when they discovered, hey, I'm here for a reason, I am here for a purpose.  It has the power to change people's lives.          It's not as dramatic as this one with Ashley and Brian.  But I have heard these stories.  And even when I was in Rwanda, I saw this taking place there, where an entire nation is kind of coming up out of the ashes.  You know, they went through that genocide in '94, and the world turned its back on an entire nation, and yet I saw a nation learning to forgive, expressing reconciliation, rebuilding.          And I asked them, what's the reason here?  And they said it's God, it's Jesus Christ.  These things have -- we've been learning that we have to forgive, because if we hold on to our hurt, it only make us miserable.          KING:  You can, though, Rick, have a purpose-driven life and be an agnostic or an atheist, can't you?  Still do good, still help others, still have purpose?        WARREN:  Absolutely, you can help other people.  I believe that we were made for a purpose, and that purpose is really to know God and to serve God and to love God, and to serve other people by -- serve God by serving others.  You know, you can't really serve God directly, Larry, not here on Earth.  The only way you can serve God is by serving other people.          KING:  Since you believe in God, if an agnostic or an atheist is doing good, God appreciates it, according to you, right?         WARREN:  God wants us all to be loving to each other, there is no doubt about that.  In fact, Jesus wouldn't have made any distinction between someone who was of a different background.  The issue was, do they love him and do they have a purpose?  Are they following his purpose?  See, I believe that we were made by God and that we were made for God.  And that until we understand that, life isn't going to make sense.  Now, really when it comes to...         KING:  So even -- go ahead, I'm sorry.          WARREN:  OK, that's OK.  There really -- when it comes to purpose, you only got three alternatives.  One of them is, you can just make up a purpose and say, this is going to be the purpose of my life.  But really, all along, you kind of know, well, is that really what I'm here for?          Another way is to just speculate about it, and one of the popular ways today is to say, look within.  And if you look within, then you'll discover your purpose.          Well, there's only one problem with that.  It doesn't work.  I've talked to a lot of people.  I looked within.  I didn't find my purpose.  Since I didn't create me, I can't tell me what my purpose is.  I have got to look to my creator.  And of course, the premise behind ""The Purpose-Driven Life"" is that you're not an accident.  That you were formed by God for a unique reason here on Earth, and that gives life meaning and significance.          We've talked about this before.  A lot of people have success, but they don't have significance.  And significance comes from knowing you're not an accident, knowing you matter to God and knowing how much he loves you, and then fulfilling that purpose.          KING:  Interesting note, Amber Frey gave Scott Peterson your book in February of 2003.  She wanted him to read it and exchange written observations about it.  A copy of your book, ""The Purpose-Driven Life,"" was in Scott Peterson's car the day he was arrested.  Guess he didn't read it?         WARREN:  That's -- yeah, I guess he didn't read it.  When the book has sold as many copies as this book has, you're going to find it in all kinds of places.  And every time I turn around, I am hearing another story about it showing up in a place like Scott Peterson's back seat.          KING:  We'll take a break and be back with more.  At the bottom of the hour, your calls for Rick Warren.  Don't go away.        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)        ASHLEY SMITH:  After I started to read to him, and he saw -- I guess he saw my faith and what I really believed in.  I told him I was a child of God and that I wanted to do God's will.  I guess he began to want to.  That's what I think.          (END VIDEO CLIP)        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)        KING:  We're with Rick Warren, author of ""The Purpose-Driven Life.""        Before we get to your phone calls at the bottom of the hour, a couple other things.          What do you make of this whole Terri Schiavo matter?  The courts have still kept the feeding tube in.  The polls indicate the public supports the husband.  Where do you stand in all this incredible matter?          WARREN:  Yes, you know, Larry, the first place -- any poll, you can make a poll say anything you want by the way you frame the question, you know that.  I think if people know the real story about Terri -- they think that she's on life support.  She's not.  They think she's brain dead, she's not.          This is a woman who is not dying, at least she wasn't, until they started starving her.  She's in a vegetative state.  That is not brain dead, and doctors will tell you person can live in a vegetative state 15, 20, 30 years.  It's unlikely that she would come out of it, but a lot of people do, and it does happen.          If I were in a vegetative state, I would hope the people that love me would keep feeding me with the possibility I might come back out of that state.  She's not on life support.  This is not a matter -- this is not a right to die issue, in my opinion.  It is the fact that they were just feeding a person who is, right now, mentally handicapped, and I, personally, I fear the day, that if we start saying, well, you don't have a right to live if you are mentally handicapped or you're physically handicapped or emotionally handicapped, and you -- we'll just, you know, stop feeding you.  This is starvation.  It's not pulling artificial life support, it's saying, we're just not going to feed you anymore.  To me, that is an atrocity worthy of Nazism.          KING:  How about the law?  Aren't we a nation of laws and don't we -- aren't we supposed to follow the courts?          WARREN:  Of course, we're a nation of laws, but the good thing about America, is that laws reside in the people and people can change the laws.  And that's the value of democracy.  That's why I love this country, because if a law is wrong, it can be changed, it can be changed by our representatives.          I think, unfortunately, Larry, this thing has become a political or ideological football and they're not thinking about the person. Terri is a real person, who smiles, who gives affection, who laughs and things like that.  In fact, I was talking earlier today with the lead attorney, David Gibbs, for Terri's parents.  He was telling me that, you know, she was responding today with laughing.  Well, a person who's on life support doesn't laugh.  She smiles.  A person who is, you know, has lost brain wave activity doesn't smile.          Barbara Weller just sent this and it said, ""just before I left the room, I leaned over Terri and I spoke right into her ear.  I told her I was very sorry that I had not been able to stop the feeding tube from being taken out and I was sorry I had to leave her alone.  But I reminded her Jesus would stay right by her side even when no one else was there with her.  When I mentioned Jesus name, Terri laughed out loud, she became very a agitated and began loudly trying to speak to me again.  And as Terri continued to laugh and try to speak, I quietly prayed in her ear and then I left the room.  Terri is alone now, and as I write this, last visit narrative, it's 5:00 in the morning of March 19th.  Terri has been without food and water for nearly 17 hours, and I'm sure she's beginning to at least feel thirsty, if not hungry, and I'm left to wonder how many other people care.""          That's not the story of somebody who's lost all brain wave activity and clearly is just, you know, an organism there.  There's still a person there and they're starving her.          KING:  By the way, Pat Boone -- you were on our show once with Pat, his grandson, Ryan, as you know, had that terrible trauma.  How is Ryan doing?        WARREN:  Well, that's good. Thanks for asking.          There's a good parallel to the Terri Schiavo case, and that is, Ryan, because of the brain damage, you would have thought that this guy was just going to be in a vegetative state the rest of his life. But I talked to Mike and to Lindy actually earlier today, and a couple of developments have happened just in the last two weeks.  One of them is, Ryan has started speaking in entire sentences.  Now, that's first, and he has not done that since his accident several years ago.  And the second thing is, Lindy walked into the room the other day and he opened his arms wide to reach out to her.  Now, that is a first, too, because of his left arm has been pretty much paralyzed and uncontrollable.          And, so, those two things give everybody here in our church and in their family hope.  But, again, it's a slow process.  What if somebody had said, well, you know what, he's not going to recover from this, let's not feed him, and he wouldn't be making the progress he's making today.          KING:  Rick, why do bad things happen to good people?          WARREN:  Well, Larry, it's because we live in a broken world. This is not perfect world.  This is not heaven and that's why we're depraved.  ""Thy will be done on earth as it is heaven.""  Why?  Because in heaven, everything's done perfectly.  Things are not done perfectly on this earth.          God gave us a freedom to choose.  As a result of choices, we make mistakes, we blow it -- and when ever I make mistakes, when ever I sin, it always causes damage and causes hurt.          The Bible teaches that since sin entered the world, way back with the very first human beings, we have lived in an imperfect, broken planet, and that causes hurricanes and tornadoes, and all kinds of things.  This is not a perfect planet.  So, we should not be surprised that it's not paradise.  And also, life is not fair.  In fact, the Bible says life is not fair.  It's just not fair.         KING:  How do you like being, by the way -- before we take a break and take calls -- I understand that you're on greeting cards now, quotes from ""The Purpose-Driven Life"" is in the select group of greetings cared that bookstores are putting it in the front.  Are you now a commodity?          WARREN:  Well, I hope not.  I tell you this.  Marketing is when you create a message in order to push a product, but what I'm doing is the exact opposite.  I'm just looking for products to share a message, because I believe that the message is life-changing -- and by the way, I didn't come up with that distinction, that was said about me in the New York Times, that I'm creating ways to simply share the message, that God loves you, he has a plan and purpose for your life, Jesus Christ died for you,  there is a reason for the things that happen in your life.  And even the bad things, God can bring good out of bad.          That's what Easter's all about, and -- the message isn't really anything new, Larry.  It's been taught for 2,000 years in churches. If somebody wants to hear it, they don't have to read my book, just go to church on Easter and hear it.          KING:  We'll take a break and come back.        Maybe not as eloquently as you state it, though.  Rick Warren, the book is ""The Purpose-Driven Life.""  It's been in all the headlines, and you'll get a chance to talk to Rick Warren, right after these words.  Don't go away.        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)        MICHAEL SCHIAVO, HUSBAND OF TERRI SCHIAVO:  There's no happy ending.  When Terri's wishes are carried out, it will be her wish, she'll be at peace.  She'll be with the Lord.          MARY SCHINDLER, MOTHER OF TERRI SCHIAVO:  My daughter is in the building behind me starving to death.  We laugh together, we cry together, we smile together, we talk together.  She is my life.          (END VIDEO CLIP)        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)        SMITH:  Throughout my time with Mr. Nichols, I continued to rely on my faith in God.  God has helped me through tough times before, and he'll help me now.          (END VIDEO CLIP)        KING:  We're back with Rick Warren, author of ""The Purpose-Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here For?""  By the way, this Sunday, at Easter service, Rick Warren will be celebrating 25 years at the Saddleback Church.  He first conducted his first service there 25 years ago Easter Sunday.  Congratulations.          WARREN:  Thank you, Larry.  And actually, I'm going to be doing the message on ""The Purpose-Driven Life.""  I just thought that would be a good message, since the church was built on that.  We're going to repeat that message on Easter Sunday.          KING:  Good idea.  Let's go to calls.          Victorville, California, for Rick Warren, hello.         CALLER:  Hello, how are you?         KING:  Hi.        CALLER:  Thank you for taking my call.        KING:  Sure.        CALLER:  My question is for Mr. Warren.  I love your book, No. 1. And also that, when you do get a chance to see Mr. Nichols, what will you say to him and what questions will you ask him?         WARREN:  Well, the first thing I am going to ask him is, have you made your peace with God?  Have you developed a relationship with Jesus Christ?  Have you asked him for forgiveness for the things that you've done?  And have you decided to try to make restitution in any way to those who you hurt, the lives that you took?  That is the first and foremost thing, is to make sure, first, you're right with God, and then second, that you're right with other people as best that you can. Now, he obviously can't completely recompense those who lost their loved ones, but he needs to do what he can to do that.          KING:  You will not condemn him?         WARREN:  Well, Jesus came and said, I didn't come to condemn the world, I came to save it.  And I want to be like Jesus.  And so if I'm going to condemn anybody, I am going to condemn myself, because I'm just as guilty of doing wrong things and hurting other people -- maybe not murder, but Jesus said, you know, if you've hated people in your heart, that's bad, too.          KING:  To San Jose, California, for Rick Warren.  Hello.        CALLER:  Hello.  Larry, hey, thanks for having me on the program. I appreciate it.        KING:  Sure, go ahead.        CALLER:  Hey, Rick, congratulations on your book.  But I have to take exception to your point of view about somehow that book changed Brian Nichols' life.  Now, come on, I mean, the man executed four people.  Any purpose that he might have had was lost when he decided to kill four people in cold blood.          KING:  The book did -- before he answers, the book did help get him to at least calm down and let her go out.  It had an effect on him.  Go ahead, Rick, I'm sorry.          WARREN:  That's OK.  First place, I don't think that my book has the power to change anybody.  The book does happen to have over 1,500 Bible verses in it that I quote, and I think that that has the power to change lives, and I think that's why the book is being used to change a lot of lives.  Because I've just quoted the Bible.  And honestly, there's nothing in the book that hasn't been said in historic Christian faith for 2,000 years.  I just happened to interpret it in a simple way for the 21st century.          But I do believe in the God of the second chance, and the third, and the fourth, and the fifth, because I am living proof of it.  God has given me chances over and over and over.  And if God only gives us one chance in life, we're all doomed.       KING:  So what do you think, at that moment when she read that, and we're not a psychiatrist here, triggered in him?          WARREN:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, everybody's heard the word ""repent"" and they don't really understand what the word means.  For a lot of people, when they think of the word repentance, they think of a guy with a sandwich sign that says, ""turn or burn,"" or, ""you're going to die and fry.""          But actually, repent is the Greek word, metanoia (ph), which means literally ""to change your mind.""  And it means that when I repent, I change my mind.  First, I change my mind about God, I change my mind about myself, I change my mind about others, I change my mind about life.  And a lot of people look at repentance as a negative thing, like I'm going to have to give up this, this, and this, and this, and like it's something terrible.          You know, when I repented, Larry, years ago, I basically turned from hopelessness to hope, from darkness to light, from guilt to forgiveness, from loneliness to a family of God, from purposelessness to purpose, from having no meaning in my life to having meaning.  It was the most positive change in my life.          And I think that when Ashley shared this idea, that you know what, even though you've gone through what you've done, and you've done these bad things, that no one is beyond the point of redemption. And I do truly believe that, that even the people who are listening to this program right now, some of them say, man, I've done it, I've done too many bad things, God's fed up with me, God wouldn't be interested in me.  God wouldn't pay me any attention because, you know, I missed that boat a long time ago.  And I would say to those people, you're dead wrong.  You're just dead wrong.  There is no pit too deep that God's love is not deeper still.  And I would say that's true for Brian Nichols, it's true for me, and it's true for everybody in the whole world.  And that is what is the good news, is that it's never too late.  Never too late.  That's it.          KING:  Ladysmith, British Columbia, hello.          CALLER:  Hi, Larry.  I'm an agnostic and an RN, and I was wondering what Rick think is the purpose of Terri Schiavo's life.  And if there is a purpose, could the church -- I think she's Catholic -- get in and get her safe into the sanctity of the church, where they can take care of her, because she isn't brain dead.          KING:  Rick.          WARREN:  That's a good point.  First, I would say that I know that if it were allowed, that Terri Schiavo's feeding for the rest of her life would be taken care of by millions and millions of people, who would be happy to pay for her feeding for the rest of her life if she happened to even remain in that state.  And so that's not the issue.          The second thing I would say is, I don't know Terri's purpose, but I do know this: If your heart is still beating and your brain is still thinking, then God has a purpose for you on this planet.          Now, Terri's purpose may be to inspire other people.  It may be for others' benefit, not even her own.  And I could say this about many, many people who have had children, who were seriously retarded or in a serious handicapped state, that they could not respond the way most people are able to respond.  And yet people would say, that person brought more meaning into my life than people who had clear intelligence or had capable brain wave activity.          I do know that when Terri dies, she's going to a better place, there is no doubt about that.  I just don't believe in playing God and predetermining when she should go.  God will take her home when he's ready to take her home, and it's not our right to just starve her to death.          KING:  Do you think people of their own volition have the right to die?  The concept of whose life is it anyway?         WARREN:  No, no, I really don't believe that, Larry, because I believe that my life is not my own.  It's God's.  See, if I say it's my life, I can do whatever I want to, that is the ultimate sin.  The ultimate -- if you take the word ""sin,"" the middle letter is I.  It's I am going to be my own God.  And when I think that I run my own life -- what is the worst sin?  It's not adultery, it's not homosexuality, it's not drug addictions, it's not all these things that people tend to get upset and worry about.  Those are not the worst sins.  The worst sin is when I decide to live my life and be my own God, and I basically thumb my nose at God and say, God, I'm boss and you're not.        KING:  But if you are in interminable pain and you are -- it's your pain, and you can't stand it, you're saying that you don't have the right to your own desire not to have that pain?         WARREN:  I do believe that you have the right to painkillers.  In fact, the Bible even says so.  In fact, in the Book of Proverbs, before there were even medication, it said ""give strong drink to a man in pain and to a dying man.""  It actually recommended that you give alcohol as a painkiller in scripture before we had all these pain medications.  I do not believe that God says, you have to walk around in pain.  I don't believe that for a second.          But I do believe that I don't have the right to take my own life, because it's not my life.          KING:  OK.          Lawton, Oklahoma, Hello.        CALLER:  This is in regards to Terri Schiavo.        KING:  Yes.        CALLER:  I am so tired of people who are so sure they're speaking for god.  And how can you say that Terri Schiavo is not on life support when she can't even feed herself.  And on top of that, everyone that I have seen die was not brain dead at the moment they died.          WARREN:  Well, you're bringing up two different issues.  First, life support does not mean feeding somebody.  Life support means your artificially kept alive.  She's not artificially kept alive.  She's kept alive by the same way you're kept alive.  And if you stopped eating, you'd die and if you stopped drinking, you'd die faster.  So, that's not life support, that's just called living.  In the second place, in brain activity, she clearly has brain activity, because she's smiling.  She's responding.  She's laughing.  And I just don't have the right to take somebody else's life.  That's not my right.          KING:  We'll take a break and be back with more calls from Rick Warren, author of the number one ""New York Times"" best seller, ""The Purpose Driven Live: What on Earth am I Here for.""  Don't go away.          (COMMERCIAL BREAK)        KING:  We're back.          Hemet, California for Rick Warren.  Hello.          CALLER:  Yes, Mr. Warren.  I have a question for you regarding your book.  It's been a best-seller, long before this took place. ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a best-seller, and the movie ""The Passion of Christ"" was a best-seller.          Can you explain the sudden thirst or craving that people seem to have for religion?          Do you think it's a trend?  Do you think that it's something we're just searching for answers?          How do you explain this?          KING:  Good question.          WARREN:  That's a great question.  You know, for the last 50 years we're living in a very narcissistic culture that is me first. And everything in culture has been about me, me, me, me.  In fact, all the advertisements are, we do it all for you.  Have it your way. You've got to think about what's best for you.        And I think people have realized, that's a dead end street.  That self-centeredness leads to loneliness.  And we're a very lonely culture. We're very isolated from each other.  There isn't a sense of community.  I recently spoke at the Harvard University, at the Kennedy School of Government, and also in the law school.          And meet with Robert Putnam, who has written this book called, ""Better Together,"" about the need for community.  And I think the need for community and the need for God go hand-in-hand.  And there are really two stories going on in our culture right now.  There is the story of things are getting more worse in some ways.  Were seeing the increase in violence.  We're seeing terrorism.  We've seen these recent shootings.  We're seeing the coarsening of our society, that has disgusted a lot of people.  And there is people -- some people are more materialistic than ever.          But at the same time, there's another story going on in America, that I think is a spiritual awakening that is brewing.  And that is a desire and hunger to know God.  I don't always think it's always a desire and hunger for church.  But there is a desire and hunger to know God.          You know, the three biggest surprises of 2004 were first, as you mentioned, ""The Passion of the Christ,"" which was roundly panned by every media, and yet went on to become the third best grossing movie in history.  That was the first bit surprise.  The second was my book, where for the second year in row, 2003 and 2004, it was the best selling book in the world.  And what in the world is a book by a pastor doing at the top of the best-seller's list for two years.  And then the third was the so called values voter that we heard about during the elections, were people reacting to the coarsening of culture.          And I believe the church is ready for what I call, a second reaffirmation.  The Bible calls the church, the body of Christ.  And for too long the church has had two hands and arms amputated, and it's just been a big mouth.  And too often the church has been known for what it's against, rather than what it's for.  And I hope to make a change in that along with a lot of another people.  That we need to reattach the hands and arms, that's why I was in Africa.          Because I think the church is called to not just talk, but to share, to love, to help tackle these issues like poverty, and illiteracy and disease.  And this is grabbing a lot of people's lives. I see it all the time, that people, there's a new interest in God, in community and in spirituality.          Apex, North Carolina, hello.          CALLER:  Hi, thank you very much for taking my calls.          KING:  Sure.        CALLER:  Mr. Warner, I'm just thrilled to death to have you on Larry's show, and I just want to say, I'm thoroughly amazed at how God is working to get the message of Christ out there, it's really amazing.  I want to ask you how you keep it all in perspective.  I mean, with the question Larry asked about looking at you as a commodity.  It's so easy.  Obviously, being a Christian, humility is one of the tenants of us as Christians.  I think the pull of the world and then the materialism, and the money and the attention, can obviously have some personal stress on you.          WARREN:  It is a stress.          CALLER:  In terms of trying too -- Yes.        KING:  So, the question is, how do you keep your balance?          WARREN:  Well, you know what, when the book, Larry, and this caller, when it began to become a big success world-wide, I actually began to got to scripture to pray about what I called the stewardship of have affluence and the stewardship of influence.  And that was, God, what do I do with me money, and what do I do with the notoriety. Because, I don't think God gives either money or fame for your own ego, certainly not a pastor.          And I didn't want it.  And in fact, that's the whole reason why I never put our church services on television.  Twenty Five-years-ago I made the decision to never be on television as a church service, because I didn't want to be a televangelist.  I didn't like the lifestyle.  And I didn't like a lot of the -- I think always being in the spotlight blinds you.          And Kay (ph) and I made two very important decisions, based on two passages of scripture.  First Corinthians 9 and Psalms 72.  First with the money, we made five decisions.  First was, we weren't going to change our lifestyle one bit, no matter how much money came in. So, we still live in the same house.  We didn't buy a bigger house. We don't own a guest house.  We don't own a yacht.  I still drive a 4- year-old Ford.  And we're just are not going to let money change your lives, and I'm not going to use it to impress people.          The second decision we made was, I stopped taking the salary from my church about three years ago.          The third decision is, I added up all that the church had paid me in the past 25 years and I gave it all back.  And I did that because I don't want anybody to ever think that I was doing this for money, because I don't.  I would have done it for free from the start if I could have.  And now the book made it possible for me to give all that money back.        And right after I did that, I was interviewed by a major news magazine.  And the first question was, what's your salary?  And I was able to say, well, actually, I've now serve my church for free for 25 years.  Then we set up, No. 4, we set up three foundations, one of them called Acts of Mercy, which is used to help those who are infected and affected by AIDS globally.  And then the fifth is, we actually became reverse tithers, which means that when Kay and I got married, we began to tithe 10 percent of our income to charity, and each year in the last 30 years we've raised it a percentage, and we're not actually reverse tithers, so we give away 90 percent and live on 10 percent.  Now, that was the easy part.            KING:  Go ahead.  Quickly, go ahead.        WARREN:  Go ahead, Larry.          KING:  Let me get a break...         (CROSSTALK)        WARREN:  OK.        KING:  ... take a break and come back and finish up.  And we should have you on every week.  We'll be right back.  Don't go away.          (COMMERCIAL BREAK)        KING:  We have about four minutes left, Rick.  Go ahead.  You were saying?         WARREN:  Well, as the caller said, how are you dealing with the notoriety?  And I really began to ask God, what am I supposed to do with this?  And as I read scripture, Psalm 72 is Solomon's prayer for more influence.  And it sounds pretty selfish.  He says, God, I want you to make me more influential, I want you to bless me, I want you to give me more power.  And that sounds pretty selfish, until you read the rest of the Psalm, where he says, ""so that the king may support the widow and orphan, care for the poor, help those who are oppressed and in prison, defend the defenseless and the foreigner.""  And basically he is talking about all of the marginalized of society.  And out of that passage of scripture, I believe that the message was that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence.          And I committed to use the rest of my life, my time and my money to help those who are the unfortunate.  And as I traveled around the world, Larry, I began to say, what are the global giants, the big problems that are so big no nation can even solve them, not even the U.N.?  And I came to the conclusion that there were five what I call global giants.  Spiritual emptiness, self-centered leadership, poverty, disease and ignorance or illiteracy.  You know, half the world lives on less than $2 a day and half the world cannot read.          And so we came up with the plan called the PEACE plan, p-e-a-c-e. Plant churches, equip the leaders, assist the poor, care for the sick, and educate the next generation.          And we're right now doing a test pilot of the PEACE plan in 67 countries.  We're about a year and a half into it.  It's a two-year test plan.  We plan to go public with it -- well, now, it's going public on LARRY KING -- but we plan to go public with it in 2006, which is to mobilize hundreds of thousands of small groups that have done the 40 days of purpose in churches and communities and civic groups and corporations -- churches that have done 40 days of purpose in groups to do these five things around the world.  And that's really why I was in Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya, to test that.          KING:  One more quick call.  San Bernadino, hello.            CALLER:  Hello.         KING:  Yeah, go ahead.        CALLER:  Hi, my name's Bill.  Hi, Rick, and thank for taking my call.  I'm calling because basically two and a half years ago, my son passed away of a genetic disorder.  And I keep asking Christian people basically, what's the reason for my son being here?  And looked for scripture, and it's hard for me to comprehend.  I'm kind of like a picture person.          KING:  I'm sad to hear that.  We only have a minute, Rick.  What can you say in a minute?      WARREN:  Well, I will say this: I don't know.  And I wish I did know.  Some of the things -- the questions we ask we're not going to find the answer to until we get to heaven.  We don't understand all of what goes on.  We do know, as I said, it's not a perfect world, but some of those answers aren't going to come until we get to heaven.          KING:  And you believe his son is there?         WARREN:  Oh, absolutely.  The Bible says in Proverbs, ""the Lord preserves the simple.""  That means those who aren't competent enough to understand what it means to make a commitment of your life to Christ or to open their life up to his love, they are safe in the arms of God.          KING:  Thanks, Rick.  Thanks for being with us.          WARREN:  Thank you, Larry.          KING:  Look forward to your next visit.          WARREN:  Good to be with you.        KING:  Nice suspenders, too.          WARREN:  Thank you.        KING:  Rick Warren, author of the number one ""New York Times"" best-seller ""The Purpose-Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here For?"" His first prime-time appearance since the Ashley Smith story.          I'll be right back to tell you about tomorrow night.         (COMMERCIAL BREAK)        KING:  Quite an hour with Rick Warren.

The house is a handsome, gray, two-story colonial that smells of new carpet and Pine-Sol and aftershave; the men who live there call it Ivanwald. At the end of a tree-lined cul-de-sac, quiet but for the buzz of lawn mowers and kids playing foxes-and-hounds in the park across the road, Ivanwald sits as one house among many, clustered together like mushrooms, all devoted, like these men, to the service of Jesus Christ. The men tend every tulip in the cul-de-sac, trim every magnolia, seal every driveway smooth and black as boot leather. And they pray, assembled at the dining table or on their lawn or in the hallway or in the bunk room or on the basketball court, each man's head bowed in humility and swollen with pride (secretly, he thinks) at being counted among such a fine corps for Christ, among men to whom he will open his heart and whom he will remember when he returns to the world not born-again but remade, no longer an individual but part of the Lord's revolution, his will transformed into a weapon for what the young men call spiritual war.             Jeff, will you lead us in prayer?              Surely, brother. It is April 2002, and I have lived with these men for weeks now, not as a Christian—a term they deride as too narrow for the world they are building in Christ's honor—but as a believer. I have shared the brothers' meals and their work and their games. I have been numbered among them and have been given a part in their ministry. I have wrestled with them and showered with them and listened to their stories: I know which man resents his father's fortune and which man succumbed to the flesh of a woman not once but twice and which man dances so well he is afraid of being taken for a fag. I know what it means to be a brother, which is to say that I know what it means to be a soldier in the army of God.              Heavenly Father, I begin. Then, O Lord, but I worry that this doesn't sound intimate enough. I settle on, Dear Jesus. Dear Jesus, just, please, Jesus, let us fight for Your name.                          Ivanwald, which sits at the end of Twenty-fourth Street North in   Arlington, Virginia, is known only to its residents and to the   members and friends of the organization that sponsors it, a group of   believers who refer to themselves as the Family. The   Family is, in its own words, an invisible association,   though its membership has always consisted mostly of public   men. Senators Don Nickles (R., Okla.), Charles Grassley (R., Iowa),   Pete Domenici (R., N.Mex.), John Ensign (R., Nev.), James Inhofe   (R., Okla.), Bill Nelson (D., Fla.), and Conrad Burns (R., Mont.)   are referred to as members, as are Representatives Jim   DeMint (R., S.C.), Frank Wolf (R., Va.), Joseph Pitts (R., Pa.),   Zach Wamp (R., Tenn.), and Bart Stupak (D., Mich.). Regular prayer   groups have met in the Pentagon and at the Department of Defense,   and the Family has traditionally fostered strong ties with   businessmen in the oil and aerospace industries. The Family   maintains a closely guarded database of its associates, but it   issues no cards, collects no official dues. Members are asked not to   speak about the group or its activities.             The organization has operated under many guises, some active, some   defunct: National Committee for Christian Leadership, International   Christian Leadership, the National Leadership Council, Fellowship   House, the Fellowship Foundation, the National Fellowship Council,   the International Foundation. These groups are intended to draw   attention away from the Family, and to prevent it from becoming, in   the words of one of the Family's leaders, a target for   misunderstanding.  1 1.                   The  Los Angeles Times  reported   in September that the Fellowship Foundation alone has an annual   budget of $10 million, but that represents only a fraction of the   Family's finances. Each of the Family's organizations raises funds   independently. Ivanwald, for example, is financed at least in part   by an entity called the Wilberforce Foundation. Other projects are   financed by individual friends: wealthy businessmen,   foreign governments, church congregations, or mainstream foundations   that may be unaware of the scope of the Family's activities. At   Ivanwald, when I asked to what organization a donation check might   be made, I was told there was none; money was raised on a   man-to-man basis. Major Family donors named by the    Times  include Michael Timmis, a Detroit lawyer and Republican   fund-raiser; Paul Temple, a private investor from Maryland; and   Jerome A. Lewis, former CEO of the Petro-Lewis Corporation.      The Family's only publicized gathering is the National Prayer   Breakfast, which it established in 1953 and which, with   congressional sponsorship, it continues to organize every February   in Washington, D.C. Each year 3,000 dignitaries, representing scores   of nations, pay $425 each to attend. Steadfastly ecumenical, too   bland most years to merit much press, the breakfast is regarded by   the Family as merely a tool in a larger purpose: to recruit the   powerful attendees into smaller, more frequent prayer meetings,   where they can meet Jesus man to man.             In the process of introducing powerful men to Jesus, the Family has   managed to effect a number of behind-the-scenes acts of   diplomacy. In 1978 it secretly helped the Carter Administration   organize a worldwide call to prayer with Menachem Begin and Anwar   Sadat, and more recently, in 2001, it brought together the warring   leaders of Congo and Rwanda for a clandestine meeting, leading to   the two sides' eventual peace accord last July. Such benign acts   appear to be the exception to the rule. During the 1960s the Family   forged relationships between the U.S.  government and some of the   most anti-Communist (and dictatorial) elements within Africa's   postcolonial leadership. The Brazilian dictator General Costa e   Silva, with Family support, was overseeing regular fellowship groups   for Latin American leaders, while, in Indonesia, General Suharto   (whose tally of several hundred thousand Communists   killed marks him as one of the century's most murderous dictators)   was presiding over a group of fifty Indonesian legislators.  During   the Reagan Administration the Family helped build friendships   between the U.S. government and men such as Salvadoran general   Carlos Eugenios Vides Casanova, convicted by a Florida jury of the   torture of thousands, and Honduran general Gustavo Alvarez Martinez,   himself an evangelical minister, who was linked to both the CIA and   death squads before his own demise. We work with power where   we can, the Family's leader, Doug Coe, says, build new   power where we can't.             At the 1990 National Prayer Breakfast, George H.W. Bush praised   Doug Coe for what he described as quiet diplomacy, I wouldn't   say secret diplomacy, as an ambassador of faith.   Coe has visited nearly every world capital, often with congressmen   at his side, making friends and inviting them back to   the Family's unofficial headquarters, a mansion (just down the road   from Ivanwald) that the Family bought in 1978 with $1.5 million   donated by, among others, Tom Phillips, then the C.E.O. of arms   manufacturer Raytheon, and Ken Olsen, the founder and president of   Digital Equipment Corporation. A waterfall has been carved into the   mansion's broad lawn, from which a bronze bald eagle watches over   the Potomac River. The mansion is white and pillared and surrounded   by magnolias, and by red trees that do not so much tower above it as   whisper. The mansion is named for these trees; it is called The   Cedars, and Family members speak of it as a person. The Cedars   has a heart for the poor, they like to say. By   poor they mean not the thousands of literal poor living   barely a mile away but rather the poor  in spirit,  for theirs   is the kingdom: the senators, generals, and prime ministers who   coast to the end of Twenty-fourth Street in Arlington in black   limousines and town cars and hulking S.U.V.'s to meet one another,   to meet Jesus, to pay homage to the god of The Cedars.              There they forge relationships beyond the din of vox   populi (the Family's leaders consider democracy a manifestation of   ungodly pride) and throw away religion in favor of the   truths of the Family. Declaring God's covenant with the Jews broken,   the group's core members call themselves the new   chosen.             The brothers of Ivanwald are the Family's next generation, its high   priests in training. I had been recommended for membership by a   banker acquaintance, a recent Ivanwald alumnus, who had mistaken my   interest in Jesus for belief.  Sometimes the brothers would ask me   why I was there. They knew that I was half Jewish, that   I was a writer, and that I was from New York City, which most of   them considered to be only slightly less wicked than Baghdad or   Amsterdam.  I told my brothers that I was there to meet Jesus, and I   was: the new ruling Jesus, whose ways are secret.                          At Ivanwald, men learn to be leaders by loving their leaders. They're so busy loving us, a brother once explained to me, but who's loving them? We were. The brothers each paid $400 per month for room and board, but we were also the caretakers of The Cedars, cleaning its gutters, mowing its lawns, whacking weeds and blowing leaves and sanding. And we were called to serve on Tuesday mornings, when The Cedars hosted a regular prayer breakfast typically presided over by Ed Meese, the former attorney general. Each week the breakfast brought together a rotating group of ambassadors, businessmen, and American politicians. Three of Ivanwald's brothers also attended, wearing crisp shirts starched just for the occasion; one would sit at the table while the other two poured coffee.              The morning I attended, Charlene, the cook, scrambled up eggs with blue tortillas, Italian sausage, red pepper, and papaya. Three women from Potomac Point, an Ivanwald for girls across the road from The Cedars, came to help serve. They wore red lipstick and long skirts (makeup and feminine attire were required) and had, after several months of cleaning and serving in The Cedars while the brothers worked outside, become quite unimpressed by the high-powered clientele.  Girls don't sit in on the breakfasts, one of them told me, though she said that none of them minded because it was just politics.             The breakfast began with a prayer and a sprinkle of scripture from Meese, who sat at the head of the table. Matthew 11:27: No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. That morning's chosen introduced themselves. They were businessmen from Dallas and Oregon, a Chinese Christian dissident, a man who ran an aid group for Tibetan refugees (the Dalai Lama had been very positive on Jesus at their last meeting, he reported). Two ambassadors, from Benin and Rwanda, sat side by side. Rwanda's representative, Dr. Richard Sezibera, was an intense man who refused to eat his eggs or even any melon. He drank cup after cup of coffee, and his eyes were bloodshot. A man I didn't recognize, whom Charlene identified as a former senator, suggested that negotiators from Rwanda and Congo, trapped in a war that has slain more than 2 million, should stop worrying about who will get the diamonds and the oil and instead focus on who will get Jesus.  Power sharing is not going to work unless we change their hearts, he said.              Sezibera stared, incredulous. Meese chuckled and opened his mouth to speak, but Sezibera interrupted him. It is not so simple, the Rwandan said, his voice flat and low. Meese smiled. Everyone in the Family loves rebukes, and here was Rwanda rebuking them. The former senator nodded. Meese murmured, Yes, stroking his maroon leather Bible, and the words Thank you, Jesus rippled in whispers around the table as I poured Sezibera another cup of coffee.             The brothers also served at the Family's four-story, redbrick Washington town house, a former convent at 133 C Street S.E. complete with stained-glass windows.  Eight congressmen—including Senator Ensign and seven representatives 2 2.                    According to the  Los Angeles Times , congressmen who have lived there include Rep. Mike Doyle (D., Pa.), former Rep. Ed Bryant (R., Tenn.), and former Rep. John Elias Baldacci (D., Maine). The house's eight congressman-tenants each pay $600 per month in rent for use of a town house that includes nine bathrooms and five living rooms. When the  Times  asked then-resident Rep. Bart Stupak (D., Mich.) about the property, he replied, We sort of don't talk to the press about the house. —lived there, brothers in Christ just like us, only more powerful. We scrubbed their toilets, hoovered their carpets, polished their silver. The day I worked at C Street I ran into Doug Coe, who was tutoring Todd Tiahrt, a Republican congressman from Kansas. A friendly, plainspoken man with a bright, lazy smile, Coe has worked for the Family since 1959, soon after he graduated from college, and has led it since 1969.              Tiahrt was a short shot glass of a man, two parts flawless hair and one part teeth. He wanted to know the best way for the Christian to win the race with the Muslim. The Muslim, he said, has too many babies, while Americans kill too many of theirs.             Doug agreed this could be a problem. But he was more concerned that the focus on labels like Christian might get in the way of the congressman's prayers. Religion distracts people from Jesus, Doug said, and allows them to isolate Christ's will from their work in the world.              People separate it out, he warned Tiahrt. 'Oh, okay, I got religion, that's private.' As if Jesus doesn't know anything about building highways, or Social Security. We gotta take Jesus out of the religious wrapping.             All right, how do we do that? Tiahrt asked.              A covenant, Doug answered. The congressman half-smiled, as if caught between confessing his ignorance and pretending he knew what Doug was talking about. Like the Mafia, Doug clarified. Look at the strength of their bonds. He made a fist and held it before Tiahrt's face. Tiahrt nodded, squinting. See, for them it's honor, Doug said. For us, it's Jesus.              Coe listed other men who had changed the world through the strength of the covenants they had forged with their brothers: Look at Hitler, he said. Lenin, Ho Chi Minh, Bin Laden. The Family, of course, possessed a weapon those leaders lacked: the total Jesus of a brotherhood in Christ.                That 's what you get with a covenant, said Coe. Jesus plus nothing.                                           To the Family, Jesus is not just a name; he is also a real     man. An awesome guy, a Family employee named Terry     told the brothers over breakfast one morning. He excelled in     every activity. He was a great teacher, sure, but he was also a     real guy's guy. He would have made an  excellent      athlete.              On my first day at Ivanwald, on an uneven court behind the house, I learned to play a two-ball variant of basketball called bump that was designed to sharpen both body and soul. In bump, players compete at free throws, each vying to sink his own before the man behind him sinks his. If he hits first then you're out, with one exception: the basket's net narrows at the chute so that the ball sometimes sticks, at which point another player can hurl his ball up from beneath, knocking the first ball out. In this event everyone cries  Bu-u-ump,  with great joy.              Bengt began it. He was one of the house's leaders, a twenty-four-year-old North Carolinian with sad eyes and spiky eyebrows and a loud, disarming laugh that made him sound like a donkey. From inside the house, waiting for a phone call, he opened a second-floor window and called to Gannon for a ball. Gannon, the son of a Texas oilman, worked as a Senate aide 3 3.                    Gannon worked for Senator Don Nickles, then the second-ranking Republican.  The man who oversaw Ivanwald and interviewed us for admission was a lawyer named Steve South, who formerly had been Senator Nickles's chief counsel and was still a close associate. ; he had blond hair and a chin like a plow, and he sang in a choir. He tossed one up, which Bengt caught and dispatched toward the basket. Nice, Gannon drawled as the ball sank through.               As soon as the ball bounced off the rim, Beau was at the free-throw line, taking his shot. Beau was a good-natured Atlantan with the build of a wrestler; as a bumper he was second only to Bengt.              It's okay if you bump into the other guys, too, Gannon told me as my turn approached. The idea's kinda to get that tension building. Ahead of me Beau bent his knees to take another shot. The moment the ball rolled off his fingers, Wayne, also from Georgia, jumped up and hurled his own ball over Beau's head. As he returned to earth, his elbow descended on Beau's shoulder like a hammer. Bump  that,  he said.             Bump was designed to bring out your hostilities. The Family believes that you can't grow in Jesus unless you face your anger, and then abandon it.  When bump worked right, each man was supposed to lose himself, forgetting even the precepts of the game. Sometimes you wanted to get the ball in, sometimes you wanted to knock it out. In, out, it didn't matter. Your ball, his, who cared? Bump wasn't horseplay, it was a physicalized theology. It was to basketball what the New Testament is to the Old: stripped down to one simple story that always ends the same. Bump, Jesus. Bump, Jesus.             I stepped to the line and, after missing, moved in for a layup. Wayne jumped to the line and shot. Dude! he shouted. I looked up. His ball, meant to hit mine, slammed into my forehead.  Bu-u-ump!  the boys hollered. They had bumped me with Christ.             Bengt bumped. Beau bumped. Gannon bumped. I was out of contention. Gannon joined me, then Beau. The game was down to Bengt and Wayne. When Wayne threw from behind Bengt, he hurled the ball with such force that it sent Bengt chasing his ball into the neighboring yard. Tenacious Wayne! Gannon roared. Wayne scooped up his own ball, leapt, and slam-dunked Bengt out. That's yo motha! he hollered.              Trotting back to the court, Bengt shook his head. You the man, Wayne, he said. Just keep it calm. Wayne was ready to burst.              Huddle up guys, said Bengt. We formed a circle, arms wrapped around shoulders. Okay, he said. We're gonna pray now. Lord, I just want to thank you for bringing us out here today to have fellowship in bump and for blessing this fine day with a visit from our new friend Jeff. Lord, we thank you for bringing this brother to us from up north, because we know he can learn to bump, and just—love you, and serve you and Lord, let us all just—Lord, be together in your name. Amen.                              The regimen was so precise it was relaxing: no swearing,     no drinking, no sex, no self. Watch out for magazines and don't     waste time on newspapers and never watch TV. Eat meat, study the     Gospels, play basketball: God loves a man who can sink a     three-pointer.   Pray to be broken.  O Heavenly Father. Dear     Jesus. Help me be humble. Let me do Your will. Every morning began     with a prayer, some days with outsiders—Wednesdays led by a     former Ivanwald brother, now a businessman; Thursdays led by     another executive who used tales of high finance to illuminate our     lessons from scripture, which he supplemented with xeroxed midrash     from  Fortune  or  Fast Company;  Fridays with the women     of Potomac Point. But most days it was just us boys, bleary-eyed,     gulping coffee and sugared cereal as Bengt and Jeff Connolly,     Bengt's childhood friend and our other house leader, laid out     lines of Holy Word across the table like strategy.             The dining room had once been a deck, but the boys had walled it in and roofed it over and unrolled a red Persian carpet, transforming the room into a sort of monastic meeting place, with two long tables end to end, ringed by a dozen chairs and two benches. The first day I visited Ivanwald, Bengt cleared a space for me at the head of the table and sat to my right. Beside him, Wayne slumped in his chair, his eyes hidden by a cowboy hat. Across from him sat Beau, still wearing the boxers and T-shirt he'd slept in. Bengt alone looked sharp, his hair combed, golf shirt tucked tightly into pleated chinos.              Bengt told Gannon to read our text for that morning, Psalm 139: 'O Lord, you have searched me and you know me.' The very first line made Bengt smile; this was, in his view, an awesome thing for God to have done. Bengt's manners and naive charm preceded him in every encounter. When you told him a story he would respond,  Goll-y!  just to be nice. When genuinely surprised he would exclaim,  Good ni-ight!  Sometimes it was hard to remember that he was a self-professed revolutionary.             He asked Gannon to keep reading, and then leaned back and listened.              'Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?  If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.'             Bengt raised a hand. That's great, dude. Let's talk about that. The room fell silent as Bengt stared into his Bible, running his finger up and down the gilded edge of the page. Guys, he said. What—how does that make you feel?             Known, said Gannon, almost in a whisper.             Bengt nodded. He was looking for something else, but he didn't know where it was. What does it make you think of?             Jesus? said Beau.             Bengt stroked his chin. Yeah . . . Let me read you a little more. He read in a monotone, accelerating as he went, as if he could persuade us through a sheer heap of words. 'For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb,' he concluded. His lips curled into a half smile. Man!  I mean, that's intense, right? 'In my mother's womb'—God's right in there with you. He grinned. It's like, he said, it's like, you  can't  run. Doesn't matter where you turn, 'cause Jesus is gonna be there, just waiting for you.              Beau's eyes cleared and Gannon nodded. Yeah, brother, Bengt said, an eyebrow arched. Jesus is  smart . He's gonna get you.             Gannon shook his head. Oh, he's already got me.             Me, too, Beau chimed, and then each man clasped his hands into one fist and pressed it against his forehead or his chin and prayed, eyes closed and Jesus all over his skin.                                  We prayed to be nothing. We were there to soften our hearts to authority. We instituted a rule that every man must wipe the toilet bowl after he pisses, not for cleanliness but to crush his inner rebel. Jeff C. did so by abstaining from shady R-rated movies, lest they provoke dreams of women. He was built like a leprechaun, with curly, dark blond hair and freckles and a brilliant smile. The Potomac Point girls brought him cookies; the wives of the Family's older men asked him to visit. One night, when the guys went on a swing-dancing date with the Potomac Pointers, more worldly women flocked to Jeff C., begging to be dipped and twirled. The feeling was not mutual. I just don't like girls as much as guys, he told me one day while we painted a new coat of Gettysburg Gray onto Ivanwald. He was speaking not of sex or of romance but of brotherhood. I like—he paused, his brush suspended midstroke— competence.               He ran nearly every day, often alone, down by the Potomac. On the basketball court anger sometimes overcame him:  Shoot  the ball! he would snap at Rogelio, a shy eighteen-year-old from Paraguay, one of several international brothers. But later Jeff C. would turn his lapse into a lesson, citing scripture, a verse we were to memorize or else be banished, by Jeff C. himself, to a night in the basement. Ephesians, chapter 4, verses 2627: 'In your anger do not sin': Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.             Jeff C.'s pride surfaced in unexpected ways. Once, together in the kitchen after lunch, I mentioned that I'd seen the soul singer Al Green live. Jeff C.  didn't answer. Instead he disappeared, reemerged with a Green CD, and set it in the boom box. He pressed play, and cracked his knuckles and his neck bones. His hands balled into fists, his eyes widened, and his torso became a jumping bean as his chest popped out on the downbeat. He heard me laughing, applauding, but he didn't stop. He started singing along with the Reverend. He grabbed his crotch and wrenched his shirt up and ran his hand over his stomach. Then he froze and dropped back to his ordinary voice as if narrating.              I used to work in this pizza parlor, he said. It was, like, a buncha . . . I dunno,  junkies . Heroin. He grinned. But man, they  loved  Al Green. We had a poster of him. He was, he was . . . man!  Shirtless, leather pants.  Low  leather pants. Jeff C. tugged his waistband down. Hips cocked. He shook his head and howled. Moonwalking away, he snapped his knees together, his feet spread wide, his hands in the air, testifying.               Jeff C. figured I had a thing against Southerners. Once, he asked if I thought the South was racist. I got it, I tried to tell him, I knew the North was just as bad, but he wouldn't listen. He told me I could call him a redneck or a hillbilly (I never called him either), but the truth was that he was blacker than me. He told me of his deep love for black gospel churches. Loving black people, he told me, made him a better follower of Christ. Remember that story Cal Thomas told? he asked. Thomas, a syndicated columnist, had recently stopped by Ivanwald for a mixer with young congressional staffers. He had regaled his audience with stories about tweaking his liberal colleagues, in particular about when he had addressed a conference of nonbelievers by asking if anyone knew where to buy a good negro. Jeff C. thought it was hilarious but also profound.  What Thomas had meant, he told me, was that absent the teachings of Jesus there was no reason for the strong not to enslave the weak.                                  Two weeks into my stay, David Coe, Doug's son and the presumptive heir to leadership of the Family, dropped by the house. My brothers and I assembled in the living room, where David had draped his tall frame over a burgundy leather recliner like a frat boy, one leg hanging over a padded arm.             You guys, David said, are here to learn how to rule the world. He was in his late forties, with dark, gray-flecked hair, an olive complexion, and teeth like a slab of white marble. We sat around him in a rough circle, on couches and chairs, as the afternoon light slanted through the wooden blinds onto walls adorned with foxhunting lithographs and a giant tapestry of the Last Supper.  Rafael, a wealthy Ecuadoran who'd been a college soccer star before coming to Ivanwald, had a hard time with English, and he didn't understand what David had said. So he stared, lips parted in puzzlement. David seemed to like that. He stared back, holding Raf's gaze like it was a pretty thing he'd found on the ground.  You have very intense eyes, David said.              Thank you, Raf mumbled.              Hey, David said, let's talk about the Old Testament. Who would you say are its good guys?              David, Beau volunteered.              King David, David Coe said. That's a good one. David. Hey.  What would you say made King David a good guy? He was giggling, not from nervousness but from barely containable delight.             Faith? Beau said. His faith was so strong?             Yeah. David nodded as if he hadn't heard that before. Hey, you know what's interesting about King David? From the blank stares of the others I could see that they did not. Many didn't even carry a Hebrew Bible, preferring a slim volume of just the New Testament Gospels and Epistles and, from the Old, Psalms. Others had the whole book, but the gold gilt on the pages of the first two thirds remained undisturbed. King David, David Coe went on, liked to do really, really bad things. He chuckled. Here's this guy who slept with another man's wife—Bathsheba, right?—and then basically murders her husband. And this guy is one of our heroes. David shook his head. I mean, Jiminy Christmas, God likes this guy! What, he said, is  that  all about?             The answer, we discovered, was that King David had been chosen. To illustrate this point David Coe turned to Beau. Beau, let's say I hear you raped three little girls. And now here you are at Ivanwald. What would I think of you, Beau?             Beau shrank into the cushions. Probably that I'm pretty bad?              No, Beau. I wouldn't. Because I'm not here to judge you. That's not my job. I'm here for only one thing.              Jesus? Beau said. David smiled and winked.              He walked to the National Geographic map of the world mounted on the wall.  You guys know about Genghis Khan? he asked. Genghis was a man with a vision. He conquered—David stood on the couch under the map, tracing, with his hand, half the northern hemisphere—nearly everything.  He devastated nearly everything. His enemies? He beheaded them. David swiped a finger across his throat. Dop, dop, dop, dop.              David explained that when Genghis entered a defeated city he would call in the local headman and have him stuffed into a crate. Over the crate would be spread a tablecloth, and on the tablecloth would be spread a wonderful meal. And then, while the man suffocated, Genghis ate, and he didn't even hear the man's screams. David still stood on the couch, a finger in the air. Do you know what that means? He was thinking of Christ's parable of the wineskins.  You can't pour new into old, David said, returning to his chair. We elect our leaders. Jesus elects his.             He reached over and squeezed the arm of a brother. Isn't that great? David said. That's the way everything in life happens. If you're a person known to be around Jesus, you can go and do anything. And that's who you guys are. When you leave here, you're not only going to know the value of Jesus, you're going to know the people who rule the world. It's about vision. 'Get your vision straight, then relate.' Talk to the people who rule the world, and help  them  obey. Obey Him. If I obey Him myself, I help others do the same. You know why?  Because I become a warning.  We  become a warning. We warn everybody that the future king is coming. Not just of this country or that, but of the world. Then he pointed at the map, toward the Khan's vast, reclaimable empire.                                  One night I asked Josh, a brother from Atlanta who was hoping to do mission work overseas, if I could look at some materials the Family had given him. Man, I'd love to share them with you, he said, and retrieved from his bureau drawer two folders full of documents. While my brothers slept, I sat at the end of our long, oak dining table and copied them into my notebook.             In a document entitled Our Common Agreement as a Core Group, members of the Family are instructed to form a core group, or a cell, which is defined as a publicly invisible but privately identifiable group of companions. A document called Thoughts on a Core Group explains that Communists use cells as their basic structure. The mafia operates like this, and the basic unit of the Marine Corps is the four man squad. Hitler, Lenin, and many others understood the power of a small core of people.              Another document, Thoughts and Principles of the Family, sets forth political guidelines, such as                           21. We recognize the place and responsibility of national  secular  leaders in the work of advancing His kingdom.                23. To the world in general we will say that we are in Christ rather than Christian—Christian having become a political term in most of the world and in the United States a meaningless term.                24. We desire to see a leadership led by God—leaders of all levels of society who direct projects as they are led by the spirit.                         and self-examination questions:                            4. Do I give only verbal assent to the policies of the family or am I a partner in seeking the mind of the Lord?                7. Do I agree with and practice the financial precepts of the family? 4 4.                    The Family's financial precepts apparently amount to the practice of soliciting funds only privately, and often indirectly. This may also refer to what some members call biblical capitalism, the belief that God's economics are laissez-faire.                              13. Am I willing to work without human recognition?                        When the group is ready, Thoughts on a Core Group explains, it can set to work:                            After being together for a while, in this closer relationship, God will give you more insight into your own geographical area and your sphere of influence—make your opportunities a matter of prayer.   . . . The primary purpose of a core group is not to become an action group, but an invisible believing group. However, activity normally grows out of agreements reached in faith and in prayer around the person of Jesus Christ.                        Long-term goals were best summarized in a document called Youth Corps Vision. Another Family project, Youth Corps distributes pleasant brochures featuring endorsements from political leaders—among them Tsutomu Hata, a former prime minister of Japan, former secretary of state James Baker, and Yoweri Museveni, president of Uganda—and full of enthusiastic rhetoric about helping young people to learn the principles of leadership. The word Jesus is unmentioned in the brochure.              But Youth Corps Vision, which is intended only for members of the Family (it's kinda secret, Josh cautioned me), is more direct.                             The Vision is to mobilize thousands of young people world wide—committed to principle precepts, and person of Jesus Christ. . . .   A group of highly dedicated  individuals who are united together  having a total commitment to use their lives to daily seek to mature into people who talk like Jesus, act like Jesus, think like Jesus. This group will have the responsibility to:   —see that the commitment and action is maintained to the overall vision;  —see that the finest and best invisible organization is developed and maintained at all levels of the work;  —even though the structure is hidden, see that the family atmosphere is maintained, so that all people can feel a part of the family.                        Another document—Regional Reports, January 3, 2002—lists some of the nations where Youth Corps programs are already in operation: Russia, Ukraine, Romania, India, Pakistan, Uganda, Nepal, Bhutan, Ecuador, Honduras, Peru.  Youth Corps is, in many respects, a more aggressive version of Young Life, a better-known network of Christian youth groups that entice teenagers with parties and sports, and only later work Jesus into the equation. Most of my American brothers at Ivanwald had been among Young Life's elite, and many had returned to Young Life during their college summers to work as counselors. Youth Corps, whose programs are often centered around Ivanwald-style houses, prepares the best of its recruits for positions of power in business and government abroad. The goal: Two hundred national and international world leaders bound together relationally by a mutual love for God and the family.                                   Between 1984 and 1992 the Fellowship Foundation consigned 592 boxes—decades of the Family's letters, sermons, minutes, Christmas cards, travel itineraries, and lists of members—to an archive at the Billy Graham Center of Wheaton College in Illinois. Until I visited last fall, the archive had gone largely unexamined.             The Family was founded in April 1935 by Abraham Vereide, a Norwegian immigrant who made his living as a traveling preacher. One night, while lying in bed fretting about socialists, Wobblies, and a Swedish Communist who, he was sure, planned to bring Seattle under the control of Moscow, Vereide received a visitation: a voice, and a light in the dark, bright and blinding. The next day he met a friend, a wealthy businessman and former major, and the two men agreed upon a spiritual plan. They enlisted nineteen business executives in a weekly breakfast meeting and together they prayed, convinced that Jesus alone could redeem Seattle and crush the radical unions. They wanted to give Jesus a vessel, and so they asked God to raise up a leader. One of their number, a city councilman named Arthur Langlie, stood and said, I am ready to let God use me. Langlie was made first mayor and later governor, backed in both campaigns by money and muscle from his prayer-breakfast friends, whose number had rapidly multiplied. 5 5.                    As Vereide recounted in a 1961 biography,  Modern Viking , one union boss joined the group, proclaiming that the prayer movement would make unions obsolete. He said, 'I got down on my knees and asked God to forgive me . . . for I have been a disturbing factor and a thorn in Your flesh.' A rugged capitalist who had been the chairman of the employers' committee in the big strike put his left hand on the labor leader's shoulder and said, 'Jimmy, on this basis we go on together.'  Vereide and his new brothers spread out across the Northwest in chauffeured vehicles (a $20,000 Dusenburg carried brothers on one mission, he boasted). Men, wrote Vereide, thus quickened. Prayer breakfast groups were formed in dozens of cities, from San Francisco to Philadelphia. There were already enough men ministering to the down-and-out, Vereide had decided; his mission field would be men with the means to seize the world for God. Vereide called his potential flock of the rich and powerful, those in need only of the real Jesus, the up-and-out.              Vereide arrived in Washington, D.C., on September 6, 1941, as the guest of a man referred to only as Colonel Brindley. Here I am finally, he wrote to his wife, Mattie, who remained in Seattle. In a day or two—many will know that I am in town and by God's grace it will hum. Within weeks he had held his first D.C. prayer meeting, attended by more than a hundred congressmen.  By 1943, now living in a suite at Colonel Brindley's University Club, Vereide was an insider. My what a full and busy day! he wrote to Mattie on January 22.                             The Vice President brought me to the Capitol and counseled with me regarding the programs and plans, and then introduced me to Senator [Ralph Owen] Brewster, who in turn to Senator [Harold Hitz] Burton—then planned further the program [of a prayer breakfast] and enlisted their cooperation. Then to the Supreme Court for visits with some of them . . . then back to the Senate, House. . . . The hand of the Lord is upon me. He is leading.                          By the end of the war, nearly a third of U.S. senators attended one of his weekly prayer meetings.              In 1944, Vereide had foreseen what he called the new world order. Upon the termination of the war there will be many men available to carry on, Vereide wrote in a letter to his wife. Now the ground-work must be laid and our leadership brought to face God in humility, prayer and obedience. He began organizing prayer meetings for delegates to the United Nations, at which he would instruct them in God's plan for rebuilding from the wreckage of the war.  Donald Stone, a high-ranking administrator of the Marshall Plan, joined the directorship of Vereide's organization. In an undated letter, he wrote Vereide that he would soon begin a tour around the world for the [Marshall Plan], combining with this a spiritual mission. In 1946, Vereide, too, toured the world, traveling with letters of introduction from a half dozen senators and representatives, and from Paul G. Hoffman, the director of the Marshall Plan. He traveled also with a mandate from General John Hildring, assistant secretary of state, to oversee the creation of a list of good Germans of the predictable type (many of whom, Vereide believed, were being held for having the faintest connection with the Nazi regime), who could be released from prison to be used, according to their ability in the tremendous task of reconstruction. Vereide met with Jewish survivors and listened to their stories, but he nevertheless considered ex-Nazis well suited for the demands of strong government, so long as they were willing to worship Christ as they had Hitler.              In 1955, Senator Frank Carlson, a close adviser to Eisenhower and an even closer associate of Vereide's, convened a meeting at which he declared the Family's mission to be a worldwide spiritual offensive, in which common cause would be made with anyone opposed to the Soviet Union. That same year, the Family financed an anti-Communist propaganda film,  Militant Liberty,  for use by the Defense Department in influencing opinion abroad. By the Kennedy era, the spiritual offensive had fronts on every continent but Antarctica (which Family missionaries would not visit until the 1980s). In 1961, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia deeded the Family a prime parcel in downtown Addis Ababa to serve as an African headquarters, and by then the Family also had powerful friends in South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. Back home, Senator Strom Thurmond prepared several reports for Vereide concerning the Senate's deliberations. Former president Eisenhower, Doug Coe would later claim at a private meeting of politicians, once pledged secret operatives to aid the Family's operations. Even in Franco's Spain, Vereide once boasted at a prayer breakfast in 1965, there are secret cells such as the American Embassy [and] the Standard Oil office [that allow us] to move practically anywhere.             By the late sixties, Vereide's speeches to local prayer breakfast groups had become minor news events, and Family members' travels on behalf of Christ had attracted growing press attention. Vereide began to worry that the movement he had spent his life building might become just another political party. In 1966, a few years before he was promoted to heaven at age eighty-four, Vereide wrote a letter declaring it time to submerge the institutional image of [the Family]. No longer would the Family recruit its powerful members in public, nor recruit so many. There has always been one man, wrote Vereide, or a small core who have caught the vision for their country and become aware of what a 'leadership led by God' could mean spiritually to the nation and to the world. . . . It is these men, banded together, who can accomplish the vision God gave me years ago.                                   Two weeks into my stay, Bengt announced to the brothers that he was applying to graduate school. He had chosen a university close enough to commute from the house, with a classics program he hoped would complement (maybe even renew, he told me privately) his relationship with Christ. After dinner every night he would disappear into the little office beside his upstairs bunk room to compose his statement of purpose on the house's one working computer.              Knowing I was a writer, he eventually gave me the essay to read. We sat down in Ivanwald's office, a room barely big enough for the two of us.  We crossed our legs in opposite directions so as not to knock knees.                            My formal education has been a progression from confusion and despair to hope,  the essay began. Its story hewed to the familiar fundamentalist routine of lost and found: every man and woman a sinner, fallen but nonetheless redeemed.  And yet Bengt's sins were not of the flesh but of the mind. In college he had abandoned his boyhood ambition of becoming a doctor to study philosophy: Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Hegel. Raised in the faith, his ideas about God crumbled before the disciplined rage of the philosophers. I cut and ran, he told me. To Africa, where by day he worked on ships and in clinics, and by night read Dostoevsky and the Bible, its darkest and most seductive passages: Lamentations, Job, the Song of Songs. These authors were alike, his essay observed:  They wrote about [suffering] like a companion.                        I looked up. A double, I said, remembering Dostoevsky's alter egos.               Bengt nodded. You know how you can stare at something for a long time and not see it the way it really is? That's what scripture had been to me. Through Dostoevsky he began to see the Old Testament for what it is: relentless in its horror, its God a fire, a whirlwind, a bear, lying in wait, a lion in secret places. Even worse is its Man: a rapist, a murderer, a wretched thief, a fool.             But, said Bengt, that's not how it ends.             Bengt meant Jesus. I thought of the end of  The Brothers Karamazov:  the saintly Alyosha, leading a pack of boys away from a funeral to feast on pancakes, everyone clapping hands and proclaiming eternal brotherhood. In Africa, Bengt had seen people who were diseased, starving, trapped by war, but who seemed nonetheless to experience joy. Bengt recalled listening to a group of starving men play the drums. Doubt, he said, is just a prelude to joy.             I had heard this before from mainstream Christians, but I suspected Bengt meant it differently. A line in Dostoevsky's  The Possessed  reminded me of him: when the conservative nationalist Shatov asks Stavrogin, the cold-hearted radical, Wasn't it you who said that even if it was proved to you mathematically that the Truth was outside Christ, you would prefer to remain with Christ outside the Truth? Stavrogin, who refuses to be cornered, denies it.             Exactly, Bengt said. In Africa he had seen the trappings of Christianity fall away. All that remained was Christ. You can't argue with absolute power.             I put the essay down. Bengt nudged it back into my hands. I want to know what you think of my ending.                           As I have read more about Jesus,  it ran,  I have                               also been intrigued by his style of interaction with other people.  He was fascinated in particular by an encounter in the Gospel of John, chapter 1, verse 3539, in which Jesus asks two men why they are following him. In turn, the men ask where Jesus is staying, to which he replies, Come and see.  I am not sure how Jesus asks the question,  Bengt had concluded,  but from the response, it seems like he is asking, What do you desire?                        That's what it's about, Bengt said. Desire. He shifted in his chair. Think about it: 'What do you desire?'             God?             Yes.             That's the answer? I asked.             He's the question, Bengt retorted, half-smiling, satisfied with his inversion by which doubt became the essence of a dogma. God was just what Bengt desired Him to be, even as Bengt was, in the face of God, nothing. Not for aesthetics alone, I realized, did Bengt and the Family reject the label Christian. Their faith and their practice seemed closer to a perverted sort of Buddhism, their God outside the truth, their Christ everywhere and nowhere at once, His commands phrased as questions, His will as simple to divine as one's own desires. And what the Family desired, from Abraham Vereide to Doug Coe to Bengt, was power, worldly power, with which Christ's kingdom can be built, cell by cell.                                  Not long after our conversation, Bengt put a bucket beside the toilet in the downstairs bunk room. From now on, he announced, all personal items left in the living room would go into the bucket. If you're missing anything, guys, Bengt said over dinner, look in the bucket.             I looked in the bucket. Here's what I found: One pair of flip-flops. One pocket-sized edition of the sayings of Jesus. One Frisbee. One copy of  Executive Orders,  by Tom Clancy, hardcover. One brown-leather Bible, well worn, beautifully printed on onion skin, given to Bengt Carlson by Palmer Carlson. One pair of dirty underwear.             When I picked up the Bible the pages flipped open to the Gospel of John, and my eyes fell on a single underlined phrase, chapter 15, verse 3: You are already clean.                         Whenever a sufficiently large crop of God's soldiers was bunked up at Ivanwald, Doug Coe made a point of stopping by for dinner. Doug was, in spirit, Christ's closest disciple, the master bumper; the brothers viewed his visit as far more important than that of any senator or prime minister. The night he joined us he wore a crisply pressed golf shirt and dark slacks, and his skin was well tanned. He brought a guest with him, an Albanian politician whose pale face and ill-fitting gray suit made Doug seem all the more radiant. In his early seventies, Doug could have passed for fifty: his hair was dark, his cheeks taut. His smile was like a lantern.             Where, Doug asked Rogelio, are you from, in Paraguay?             Asuncin, he said.             Doug smiled. I've visited there many times. He chewed for a while.  Asuncin. A Latin leader was assassinated there twenty years ago.  A Nicaraguan. Does anybody know who it was?             I waited for someone to speak, but no one did. Somoza, I said.  The dictator overthrown by the Sandinistas.             Somoza, Doug said, his eyes sweeping back to me. An interesting man.              Doug stared. I stared back. I liked to visit him, Doug said. A very bad man, behind his machine guns. He smiled like he was going to laugh, but instead he moved his fork to his mouth. And yet, he said, a bite poised at the tip of his tongue, he had a heart for the poor. Doug stared. I stared back.             Do you ever think about prayer? he asked. But the question wasn't for me. It wasn't for anyone. Doug was preparing a parable.             There was a man he knew, he said, who didn't really believe in prayer.  So Doug made him a bet. If this man would choose something and pray for it for forty-five days, every day, he wagered God would make it so. It didn't matter whether the man believed. It wouldn't have mattered whether he was a Christian.  All that mattered was the fact of prayer. Every day. Forty-five days. He couldn't lose, Doug told the man. If Jesus didn't answer his prayers, Doug would pay him $500.             What should I pray for? the man asked.             What do you think God would like you to pray for? Doug asked him.               I don't know, said the man. How about Africa?              Good, said Doug. Pick a country.              Uganda, the man said, because it was the only one he could remember.               Fine, Doug told him. Every day, for forty-five days, pray for Uganda. God please help Uganda. God please help Uganda.              On the thirty-second day, Doug told us, this man met a woman from Uganda. She worked with orphans. Come visit, she told the man, and so he did, that very weekend.  And when he came home, he raised a million dollars in donated medicine for the orphans. So you see, Doug told him, God answered your prayers.  You owe me $500.             There was more. After the man had returned to the United States, the president of Uganda called the man at his home and said, I am making a new government.  Will you help me make some decisions?             So, Doug told us, my friend said to the president, 'Why don't you come and pray with me in America? I have a good group of friends—senators, congressmen—who I like to pray with, and they'd like to pray with you.'  And that president came to The Cedars, and he met Jesus. And his name is Yoweri Museveni, and he is now the president of all the presidents in Africa. And he is a good friend of the Family.              That's awesome, Beau said.              Yes, Doug said, it's good to have friends. Do you know what a difference a friend can make? A friend you can agree with? He smiled.  Two or three agree, and they pray? They can do anything. Agree. Agreement.  What's that mean? Doug looked at me. You're a writer. What does that mean?             I remembered Paul's letter to the Philippians, which we had begun to memorize.   Fulfill ye my joy, that ye be likeminded.                        Unity, I said. Agreement means unity.             Doug didn't smile. Yes, he said.  Total  unity. Two, or three, become one. Do you know, he asked, that there's another word for that?             No one spoke.             It's called a covenant. Two, or three, agree? They can do anything. A covenant is . . . powerful. Can you think of anyone who made a covenant with his friends?              We all knew the answer to this, having heard his name invoked numerous times in this context. Andrew from Australia, sitting beside Doug, cleared his throat: Hitler.              Yes, Doug said. Yes, Hitler made a covenant. The Mafia makes a covenant. It is such a very powerful thing. Two, or three, agree. He took another bite from his plate, planted his fork on its tines. Well, guys, he said, I gotta go.              As Doug Coe left, my brothers' hearts were beating hard: for the poor, for a covenant. Awesome, Bengt said. We stood to clear our dishes.                         On one of my last nights at Ivanwald, the neighborhood boys asked my brothers and me to play. There were roughly six boys, ranging in age from maybe seven to eleven, all junior members of the Family. They wanted to play flashlight tag. It was balmy, and the streetlight glittered against the blacktop, and hiding places beckoned from behind trees and in bushes. One of the boys began counting, and my brothers, big and small, scattered. I lay flat on a hillside. From there I could track movement in the shadows and smell the mint leaves planted in the garden. A figure approached and I sprang up and ran, down the sidewalk and up through the garden, over a wall that my pursuer, a small boy, had trouble climbing. But once he was over he kept charging, and just as I was about to vanish into the trees his flashlight caught me. Jeff I see you you're

Books such as Richard Dawkins The God Delusion, Christopher Hitchens God Is Not Great, and Sam Harris The End of Faith, all contend that Western society would be better off if we could eradicate from it the last vestiges of Christianity. But Christianity is largely responsible for many of the principles and institutions that even secular people cherishchief among them equality and liberty.   When Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, he called the proposition self-evident. But he did not mean that it is immediately evident. It requires a certain kind of learning. And indeed most cultures throughout history, and even today, reject the proposition.     At first glance, there is admittedly something absurd about the claim of human equality, when all around us we see dramatic evidence of inequality. People are unequal in height, in weight, in strength, in stamina, in intelligence, in perseverance, in truthfulness, and in about every other quality. But of course Jefferson knew this. He was asserting human equality of a special kind. Human beings, he was saying, are moral equals, each of whom possesses certain equal rights. They differ in many respects, but each of their lives has a moral worth no greater and no less than that of any other. According to this doctrine, the rights of a Philadelphia street sweeper are the same as those of Jefferson himself.   This idea of the preciousness and equal worth of every human being is largely rooted in Christianity. Christians believe that God places infinite value on every human life. Christian salvation does not attach itself to a persons family or tribe or city. It is an individual matter. And not only are Christians judged at the end of their lives as individuals, but throughout their lives they relate to God on that basis. This aspect of Christianity had momentous consequences.   Though the American founders were inspired by the examples of Greece and Rome, they also saw limitations in those examples. Alexander Hamilton wrote that it would be as ridiculous to seek for [political] models in the simple ages of Greece and Rome as it would be to go in quest of them among the Hottentots and Laplanders. In The Federalist Papers, we read at one point that the classical idea of liberty decreed to the same citizens the hemlock on one day and statues on the next&. And elsewhere: Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob. While the ancients had direct democracy that was susceptible to the unjust passions of the mob and supported by large-scale slavery, we today have representative democracy, with full citizenship and the franchise extended in principle to all. Let us try to understand how this great change came about.   A New Morality  In ancient Greece and Rome, individual human life had no particular value in and of itself. The Spartans left weak children to die on the hillside. Infanticide was common, as it is common even today in many parts of the world. Fathers who wanted sons had few qualms about drowning their newborn daughters. Human beings were routinely bludgeoned to death or mauled by wild animals in the Roman gladiatorial arena. Many of the great classical thinkers saw nothing wrong with these practices. Christianity, on the other hand, contributed to their demise by fostering moral outrage at the mistreatment of innocent human life.   Likewise, women had a very low status in ancient Greece and Rome, as they do today in many cultures, notably in the Muslim world. Such views are common in patriarchal cultures. And they were prevalent as well in the Jewish society in which Jesus lived. But Jesus broke the traditional taboos of his time when he scandalously permitted women of low social status to travel with him and be part of his circle of friends and confidantes.   Christianity did not immediately and directly contest patriarchy, but it helped to elevate the status of women in society. The Christian prohibition of adultery, a sin it viewed as equally serious for men and women, and rules concerning divorce that (unlike in Judaism and Islam) treated men and women equally, helped to improve the social status of women. Indeed so dignified was the position of the woman in Christian marriage that women predominated in the early Christian church, and the pagan Romans scorned Christianity as a religion for women.   Then there is slavery, a favorite topic for the new atheist writers. Consult the Bible, Sam Harris writes in Letter to a Christian Nation, and you will discover that the creator of the universe clearly expects us to keep slaves. Steven Weinberg notes that Christianity&lived comfortably with slavery for many centuries. Nor are they the first to fault Christianity for its alleged approval of slavery. But we must remember that slavery pre-dated Christianity by centuries and even millennia. It was widely practiced in the ancient world, from China and India to Greece and Rome. Most cultures regarded it as an indispensable institution, like the family. Sociologist Orlando Patterson has noted that for centuries, slavery needed no defenders because it had no critics.   But Christianity, from its very beginning, discouraged the enslavement of fellow Christians. We read in one of Pauls letters that Paul himself interceded with a master named Philemon on behalf of his runaway slave, and encouraged Philemon to think of his slave as a brother instead. Confronted with the question of how a slave can also be a brother, Christians began to regard slavery as indefensible. As a result, slavery withered throughout medieval Christendom and was eventually replaced by serfdom. While slaves were human tools, serfs had rights of marriage, contract, and property ownership that were legally enforceable. And of course serfdom itself would eventually collapse under the weight of the argument for human dignity.   Moreover, politically active Christians were at the forefront of the modern anti-slavery movement. In England, William Wilberforce spearheaded a campaign that began with almost no support and was driven entirely by his Christian convictionsa story powerfully told in the recent film Amazing Grace. Eventually Wilberforce triumphed, and in 1833 slavery was outlawed in Britain. Pressed by religious groups at home, England then took the lead in repressing the slave trade abroad.   [...]   Freedom Redefined  Christianity has also lent force to the modern concept of individual freedom. There are hints of this concept both in the classical world and in the world of the ancient Hebrews. One finds, in such figures as Socrates and the Hebrew prophets, notable individuals who have the courage to stand up and question even the highest expressions of power. But while these cultures produced great individuals, as other cultures often do today, none of them cultivated an appreciation for individuality. And it is significant that Socrates and the Hebrew prophets came to bad ends. They were anomalies in their societies, and those societieslacking respect for individual freedomgot rid of them.   As Benjamin Constant pointed out, freedom in the ancient world was the right to participate in the making of laws. Greek democracy was direct democracy in which every citizen could show up in the agora, debate issues of taxes and war, and vote on what action the polis should take. The Greeks exercised their freedom solely through active involvement in the political life of the city. There was no other kind of freedom and certainly no freedom of thought or of religion of the kind that we hold dear. The modern idea of freedom, by contrast, is rooted in a respect for the individual. It means the right to express our opinion, the right to choose a career, the right to buy and sell property, the right to travel where we want, the right to our own personal space, and the right to live our own life. In return, we are responsible only to respect the rights of others. This is the freedom we are ready to fight for, and we become indignant when it is challenged or taken away.   Christianity has played a vital role in the development of this new concept of freedom through its doctrine that all human beings are moral agents, created in Gods image, with the ability to be the architects of their own lives. The Enlightenment certainly contributed to this understanding of human freedom, though it drew from ideas about the worth of the individual that had been promulgated above all by the teachings of Christianity.   ————————   Let me conclude with a warning first issued by one of Western civilizations greatest atheists, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The ideas that define Western civilization, Nietzsche said, are based on Christianity. Because some of these ideas seem to have taken on a life of their own, we might have the illusion that we can abandon Christianity while retaining them. This illusion, Nietzsche warns us, is just that. Remove Christianity and the ideas fall too.   Consider the example of Europe, where secularization has been occurring for well over a century. For a while it seemed that secularization would have no effect on European morality or social institutions. Yet increasingly today there is evidence of the decline of the nuclear family. Overall birthrates have plummeted, while rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock births are up.   Nietzsche also warned that, with the decline of Christianity, new and opposing ideas would arise. We see these today in demands for the radical redefinition of the family, the revival of eugenic theories, and even arguments for infanticide.   In sum, the eradication of Christianityand of organized religion in generalwould also mean the gradual extinction of the principles of human dignity. Consider human equality. Why do we hold to it? The Christian idea of equality in Gods eyes is undeniably largely responsible. The attempt to ground respect for equality on a purely secular basis ignores the vital contribution by Christianity to its spread. It is folly to believe that it could survive without the continuing aid of religious belief.   If we cherish what is distinctive about Western civilization, thenwhatever our religious convictionswe should respect rather than denigrate its Christian roots.   . . .  more                                                                          Thursday 08 Jan 2009  |             Blog-Editor  |  Christianity ,   Culture war ,   Defense of Innocence  |                One Response to “Created Equal: How Christianity Shaped the West”                   1)  |    Top  | Jan 09 2009 |  Margaret Mueller             Latest direct attack on Christianity:   http://www.thegodmovie.com/   note who is supporting this effort.
