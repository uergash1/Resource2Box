GX009-19-11113699	"Brooklyn,            New York:           On            August 19, 1991, violence erupted in the Crown Heights Community of            Brooklyn after a car being driven as part of a security convoy struck            and killed an African-American male, age seven. In the ensuing violence,            a group of African-Americans attacked and stabbed Yankel Rosenbaum,            a visiting Hasidic scholar from Australia. Rosenbaum subsequently died            from the injuries he sustained.                         On August 27, 1991, Lemrick Nelson, an African-American male, age 16,            was charged locally with murdering Rosenbaum. On October 29, 1992, Nelson            was acquitted. Following the local acquittal, the Department of Justice            requested that the FBI conduct a federal civil rights investigation.            On August 11, 1994, Nelson was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury and            charged with violation Title 18, U.S.C., Section 245. On August 7, 1996,            a second subject, Charles Price, was also indicted and charged with            violating Title 18, U.S.C., Section 245. Price was observed at the scene            of the Rosenbaum attack inciting the crowd to violence. After four days            of deliberations, both subjects were found guilty on February 10, 1997,            of federal civil rights violations. On March 31, 1998, Nelson was sentenced            to 235 months in prison. On July 9, 1998, Price was sentenced to 260            months in prison.                           Los            Angeles, CA:                      On            October 3, 1996, FBI Los Angeles initiated an investigation at the request            of the Los Angeles Attorney's Office after local newspapers reported            an unidentified individual had sent threatening E-mail messages to 58            University of California at Irvine (UCI) students. The message blamed            Asian students for all the crimes that occurred on the UCI campus, and            the author wrote that he wanted Asians to leave UCI or he would hunt            them down and kill them. The writer was identified as Richard Machado,            a former UCI student.           A            summons was issued ordering him to appear before a federal magistrate            on November 25, 1996, in Santa Ana, California. Machado did not show            for initial appearance and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Machado's            former employer, roommates, and family members claimed to have no knowledge            of his whereabouts.           He            was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury and on November 13, 1996, and a            Failure to Appear warrant was issued. Machado's whereabouts were unknown            until February 6, 1997 when he was arrested by United States Customs            Agents at Nogales, Arizona, while attempting to enter the United States            from Mexico.           Machado            was returned to the central district of California by United States            Marshal's on March 3, 1997. He was declared a flight risk by a U.S.            Magistrate Judge and ordered detained on March 5, 1997. Machado entered            a not guilty plea during his arraignment in Santa Ana, California, on            March 10, 1997.           On            November 13, 1996, Richard Machado, was indicted by a Federal Grand            Jury, and charged with ten counts of Interference with Federally Protected            Activities, 18 U.S.C., Section 245 (b) 2 (A). The trial began on November            4, 1997 with the defense and prosecution giving closing arguments on            November 18, 1997. After three days of deliberations, a jury could not            reach a verdict and U.S. District Judge Alicemarie Stotler declared            a mistrial. A hearing was held on December 1, 1997, to consider bail            reduction. The defendant was still considered a fight risk, and the            judge ordered him detained pending a new trial. A new trial date was            set for January 27, 1998.           During            the second trial, Machado was charged with two counts of Interfering            with Federally Protected Activities. That trial began on January 27,            1998. A guilty verdict was returned on one count February 10, 1998.            The jury failed to agree on a verdict pertaining to the second count.           On            September 24, 1998, Machado admitted to violating his probation requirements.            A U.S. District Judge sentenced him to four months in a halfway house            and eight months supervised probation.           On            May 4, 1998, Machado was sentenced to one year in jail and was given            credit for maximum time already served. Conditions for his supervised            release were submission to scheduled drug tests; counseling in racial            relations; no driver's license or passport applications without approval            from his probation officer; no trespassing on UCI campus and no contact            with recipients of the hate mail or witnesses in the trial.                                  Back            To Top                                                                                 Dallas, Texas:           On            April 26, 1997, Donald Ray Anderson drove his 1978 Cadillac into the            parking lot of the Baruch Ha Shem Synagogue. At the time, members of            the synagogue were present and participating in regular service. After            exiting his vehicle, Anderson, armed with an SKS rifle, walked to the            synagogue's courtyard. Upon entering the courtyard, Anderson was allegedly            heard to have yelled, ""I'm here to expose the Jewish conspiracy.""            He then aimed his gun toward a woman who was present in the courtyard.            Thereafter, he raised the gun and shot four to five times into the air.            Anderson then returned to the parking lot and shot numerous times at            the synagogue itself.                         On May 14, 1997, a Dallas, Texas, Grand Jury indicted Anderson on four            counts of aggravated assault and one count of deadly conduct. Although            he was indicted on state charges, a Federal Grand Jury indicted Anderson            on August 28, 1997, charging him with violation of two counts of Title            18, U.S.C., Section 247, and one count of Title 18, U.S.C., Section            924(c) (Use of a firearm while committing a crime of violence). Subsequently,            Anderson entered into a plea agreement with the government. On May 5,            1998, Anderson was sentenced to 27 months imprisonment for violating            Title 18, U.S.C., Section 247; and 120 months imprisonment for violating            Title 18, U.S.C., Section 924(c).                                  Back            To Top                                                                       Mobile,            Alabama:                        On            July 1, 1997, St. Joseph Baptist Church was discovered burned to the            ground. Shortly thereafter, Tate Chapel A.M.E. Church, located approximately            a quarter mile from St. Joseph Baptist Church and on the same rural            road, was discovered vandalized with evidence also present of an attempted            arson. A joint investigation by the local National Church Arson Task            Force was immediately initiated. St. Joseph Baptist Church and Tate            Chapel A.M.E. Church host African American congregations.                         On July 31, 1997, subjects Alan Odom, Michael Woods, Brandy Boone, and            Kenneth Cumbie were indicted in connection with the arson of St. Joseph            Baptist Church. A second count of the indictment charged Alan Odom and            Jeremy Boone with the attempted arson of the Tate Chapel A.M.E. Church.            On November 3, 1997, Alan Odom, Brandy Boone, and John Kenneth Cumbie            were found guilty of violating Title 18, U.S.C., Section 371 and Odom            was also found guilty of violating Title 18, U.S.C., Sections 844(h)(1)            and 844(i) regarding the St. Joseph Baptist Church arson. Previously,            on October 27, 1997, defendant Michael Woods pled guilty to one count            each of the same arson related statutes.                         On November 4, 1997, the jury hearing the case involving the attempted            arson/vandalism of Tate Chapel A.M.E. Church convicted Alan Odom of            violating 18, U.S.C., Section 844(i) and acquitted him of all other            charges. Prior to the trial, Jeremy Boone, who was also charged in this            case, pled guilty to one count of violating 18, U.S.C., Section 844(i).            During the period of March 6, 1998 through March 12, 1998, each of the            subjects was sentenced. The sentences ranged from 41-180 months in prison            followed by three years of supervised probation for all subjects. In            addition, the subjects were ordered to pay restitution in the amount            of $96,836.00, jointly and severally with the other subjects to St.            Joseph Baptist Church.

The family, the only            African-Americans living in this small rural community, had resided            there for approximately two years. The flyer, which was filled with            racist and hate rhetoric, ordered the family to move from the community            within 30 days or suffer the ""wrath."" The flyer was signed,            ""Sincerely, the Last Rites."" On December 7, 1997, Daniel O'Brien            Porter, Barry Gene Dunn and Christopher Jayson Mahan were indicted and            charged with one count each of violating Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241,            and Title 42, U.S.C., Section 3631. Porter and Dunn pled guilty to the            above mentioned charges on April 6, 1998 prior to the commencement of            a federal trial. Mahan was convicted on April 7, 1998.

GX235-92-15955697	"Contact:  Sam Thompson (505) 222-9042   June 14, 2002   AG:  Judge Requires Full Restitution    in ""La Familia Grande"" Pyramid Scheme    (Albuquerque, NM)   Attorney General Patricia Madrid announced that Estevan    Apodaca, organizer of a pyramid scheme known as ""La Familia Grande"",    has been required by District Judge Ross Sanchez to provide full restitution    of up to $30,000 to victims of the scheme within 45 days.    The Judge ordered    Apodaca to appear before the court August 1, 2002, for final sentencing.   Apocada entered a plea of guilty to two felony counts of violating the Pyramid    Promotional Schemes Act in February 2002, which exposed him to a possible 3    years in prison.  Two victims of scheme spoke at the sentencing explaining their    losses in the scheme as well as Apodaca's insistence that the scheme was legal    and no one would be prosecuted.     ""Pyramid activity has been victimizing New Mexicans for too long.  I hope    that anyone who might still believe that these schemes are victimless activities    will rethink their position.  Pyramid activity is illegal under New Mexico law    - it is just that simple.  Unless the legislature is convinced to the contrary,    pyramid activity will continue to be illegal and those that take money from    others in these schemes may find themselves arrested for a felony,"" Attorney    General Madrid said.  ""When people lose money in these schemes, they turn    to law enforcement authorities or civil court for help.  The best advice I can    give to New Mexicans is simply to recognize that offers to make quick, easy    money are really opportunities for you to lose money.""   Two others indicted with Apodaca, Debbie Cattin and Paul Chavez, have entered    pre-prosecution diversion.  Making restitution to those from whom money was    taken is one of the conditions of the program.  Charges were dropped against    the fourth individual indicted with Apodaca.     Pre-prosecution diversion may be offered to individuals about whom complaints    alleging their participation in illegal pyramid activity have been filed with    the Office of the Attorney General.  Individuals who have not taken advantage    of the offer face potential indictment on criminal charges.   Pyramid activity was initially reported in New Mexico is April 2000.  At that    time, the Taos    District Attorney issued a warning about schemes called ""The Dinner Party,""    ""The Gifting Circle,"" and ""The Circle of Friends.""  The    first formal complaints about the schemes were not reported to the Office of    the Attorney General until December 2000.  The first arrests for pyramid activity    called ""Women Helping Women"" occurred in March 2001.    Approximately four hundred individuals have reported money losses in pyramid    schemes in New Mexico.  At the Attorney General's office, restitution to those    who have lost money has exceeded $50,000, with more expected over the next six    months.  Some people who have lost money have sued for restitution in magistrate    courts, this information is not available from the Office of the Attorney General.     ####"
GX253-82-13503167	OLR Bill Analysis    sHB 5059    AN ACT CONCERNING HUNTING SAFETY.    SUMMARY :    This bill creates the crimes of negligent hunting and hunting while under the influence or impaired.  It imposes enhanced penalties for persistent offenders. It generally requires the person arrested for these crimes to surrender his weapon.    By law, a hunter whose license has been suspended for violation of hunting laws must complete a remedial hunter education course designed by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) before his license can be reinstated.  The bill additionally requires the hunter to demonstrate that he has passed a conservation education/firearms safety course or its equivalent, as specified by DEP.    EFFECTIVE DATE:  October 1, 2000    NEGLIGENT HUNTING    The bill establishes four degrees of negligent hunting.  Hunting is:    1. pursuing, shooting, killing, and capturing a bird, four-legged animal, or reptile, or trying to do these things, whether or not this results in taking the animal or    2. any act of assistance in taking or attempting to take such an animal.    The bill establishes, as  prima facie  evidence that someone was hunting, his possession of a loaded hunting weapon while at, entering, or leaving an area where a reasonable person would believe the objective was to take wildlife.      But, the bill allows a person to possess a loaded long gun one hour before sunrise during deer and turkey firearms season if it does not have a live round in it.    A loaded hunting weapon is:    1. a long gun with a live round in the chamber or in a magazine attached to the gun,    2. a muzzle-loaded gun with a percussion cap in place,    3. a flintlock firearm with powder in the pan,    4. a bow with an arrow notched on it,    5. a drawn crossbow with a bolt in place, or    6. a high velocity air gun charged with a projectile in the chamber or in an attached magazine.    First Degree    A person is guilty of negligent hunting in the first degree when, with criminal negligence, he shoots a loaded hunting weapon and kills someone while hunting. Criminal negligence means failing to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result or circumstance described in a statute will occur.      Negligent hunting is a class D felony subject to imprisonment of one to five years, of which one year may not be suspended or reduced, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license indefinitely.    Second Degree    A person is guilty of this crime when, with criminal negligence, he (1) violates the law against jacklighting for deer or (2) shoots a loaded hunting weapon and causes serious physical injury to another person.  A serious physical injury is one that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes serious (1) disfigurement, (2) impairment of health, or (3) loss or impairment of a bodily organ's function.  The offense is a class A misdemeanor. The offender must be fined between $400 and $2,000 and can be imprisoned for up to one year.  In addition, DEP can suspend his license for up to 10 years.    Third Degree    A person is guilty of this crime if he, while hunting:      1. fires a loaded hunting weapon at a time of day when hunting is prohibited,       2. hunts on Sundays, or outside of hunting season;      3. shoots a firearm from a vehicle;      4. hunts with a suspended license; or      5. shoots an occupied dwelling.    This crime is a class B misdemeanor.  The hunter must be fined $200 to $1,000 and can be imprisoned up to six months. In addition, DEP can suspend his license for up to five years.    Fourth Degree    A person is guilty of this crime if he, while hunting:    1. hunts without buying the license, permit, or stamp required by law;    2. possesses a loaded hunting weapon during a time of day when hunting is prohibited;    3. hunts from or fires a hunting weapon across a public highway.    A person is also guilty of this crime if he hunts with or fires a firearm within (1) 250 feet of building occupied by people or domestic animals or used to store flammable or combustible material or (2) 125 feet of any of these buildings while hunting in tidal water.  This provision does not apply if the hunter is carrying the written authorization of the building's owner.     The crime is a class C misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to three months, a fine of up to $500, or both.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license for up to three years.    Allocation of Fines    Under the bill, fines for first-and second-degree negligent hunting go to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.  Fines for third-and fourth-degree negligent hunting go to the Conservation Fund, for land management or acquisition of hunting easements.    HUNTING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OR IMPAIRED    Elements of the Crime    The bill prohibits hunting while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs.  A person is considered impaired if his blood alcohol content at the time of the offense was .07%to .10%.  A person is considered under the influence if his BAC is above .10%.  If he has been previously convicted of hunting under the influence the threshold is .07%. A person can also be found to be under the influence independent of his BAC.     The bill allows DEP enforcement officers to arrest people for this crime.    Alcohol Testing Procedures    The bill extends the laws regarding alcohol tests that currently apply to drunk boating to hunting while under the influence or while impaired.  The law specifies that the arresting officer determine whether to give a blood, breath, or urine test; if the person is unwilling or unable to submit to a blood test, the officer must designate a breath or urine test.  If the person refuses to submit to the test, none is administered.  The refusal to submit to a test is admissible in court if the person was (1) placed under arrest, (2) informed of his constitutional rights, (3) given an opportunity to call a lawyer, and (4) informed that refusal is admissible and can be used against him.      Admissibility of Test Results    As under the boating laws, the test results are admissible if:    1. the hunter was given a chance to call a lawyer and submitted to the test;    2. a true copy of the test result was mailed or delivered to the defendant within 24 hours or the end of the next business day after the result is known, whichever is later;    3. the test was performed by or at the direction of a law enforcement officer, using methods and equipment approved by the Department of Public Health (DPH);    4. the test was performed by a person certified for this purpose by DPH or recertified by a DPH-certified instructor;    5. any blood sample was taken by a medical professional with specified credentials;    6. the testing device was checked for accuracy by a DPH-certified person at the beginning and by the end of the workday; and    7. evidence is presented that demonstrates that the BAC at the time of the test accurately reflected the BAC at the time of the alleged offense.    In addition, a second test of the same type must be administered at least 30 minutes after the first test and the testing device was checked for accuracy by DPH-certified person.  But, the results of the first test can be admitted if reasonable efforts were made to conduct the second test, even if the second test was not performed, was not performed within a reasonable time, or fails to meet the other criteria.    Penalties    Violation of the bill's drunk hunting provisions is a class A misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for up to one year, a fine of up to $2,000, or both.  The fines go to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license indefinitely.    PERSISTENT OFFENDERS    Under the bill, a person convicted of (1) negligent hunting in the first, second, or third degree or (2) hunting while impaired or under the influence within five years of a conviction of negligent hunting is considered a persistent negligent hunter.  A persistent negligent hunter must be fined at least twice the minimum provided for the second violation, that is, $400 for a conviction of negligent hunting in third degree and $800 for a conviction of negligent hunting in the second degree.  The hunter also is subject to the penalties for the next more serious degree of negligent hunting or hunting while impaired or under the influence.  The provision has no effect with regard to the drunk hunting crimes, since they have only one degree and no minimum fine.  It appears that any fine imposed on a persistent offender would go to the General Fund.    SURRENDER OF WEAPON    The bill requires anyone arrested for negligent hunting in the first, second, or third degree or hunting under the influence or impaired to surrender any weapon in his possession.  The police or conservation officer must confiscate the weapon at the time of the arrest.  If the hunter is acquitted or the charge is dismissed or nolled, the weapon must be returned in the same condition as when it was confiscated.    If the hunter is convicted, the weapon must turned over to DEP.  DEP can (1) retain the weapon for agency use; (2) convey to the Department of Administrative Services for sale at auction, with the proceeds going to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund; or (3) destroy the weapon.    These provisions to not apply to weapons used to jacklight deer, which are already subject to separate disposition procedures.

Kelly, 619-557-6216      For Immediate Release    NEWS RELEASE SUMMARY       United States Attorney Carol C. Lam today announced the entry of two guilty pleas and the indictments of four individuals in the investigation of PinnFund, U.S.A., Inc. (""PinnFund"").     PinnFund was a Carlsbad-based mortgage lender closed down by court order on March 23, 2001,  upon application of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").  Investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development - Office of the Inspector General,  in conjunction with the SEC, revealed that PinnFund had operated as a massive Ponzi scheme, resulting in losses of over $200 million by hundreds of investors.       KEITH G. GRUBBA, the former President and 40% owner of PinnFund from July 1996 to February 2001,  and MICHAEL A. TRAP, the former Syndication Manager of a related company, PinnLease USA,  entered guilty pleas in federal court before the Honorable Marilyn L. Huff to PinnFund-related criminal charges.       During his guilty plea, GRUBBA admitted  that he conspired with Michael Fanghella and John Garitta to deceive investors and thereby perpetuate the Ponzi scheme by various means, including the preparation and dissemination of false financial statements. GRUBBA admitted in court that he filed federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 2000, in which he failed to declare his full income, including illegal income derived from his Ponzi scheme activity.  Grubba evaded reporting over $6.7 million in gross income for the tax years 1997 through 2000, with a tax due and owing of approximately $2.5 million.  Grubba is scheduled to be sentenced on Monday, April 21, 2003, at 9:00 a.m. ,  and faces up to thirty years' imprisonment.     TRAP pled guilty to charges that he lied to a federal grand jury investigating PinnFund and its subsidiary, PinnLease USA, Inc.  TRAP is scheduled to be sentenced on April 21, 2003, at 9:00 a.m., and faces up to five years' imprisonment.     In a related development,  a federal grand jury today returned a  29-count indictment against  JAMES L. HILLMAN and PIOTR KODZIS,  charging them with intentionally having defrauded investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars by misrepresenting PinnFund's operations and compliance with investor agreements.  The indictment also charges that HILLMAN and KODZIS misrepresented the extent of their oversight and review of PinnFund's operations, and concealed various material facts, including their knowledge of multiple sets of contradictory PinnFund financial statements.  HILLMAN and KODZIS are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud.     A second 23-count indictment was also returned alleging  that TOMMY A. LARSEN and his son, KIM A. LARSEN, schemed  to obtain funds for PinnFund through fraudulent equipment leases and laundering their kickbacks of those funds to PinnFund through sham transactions and false invoices.  TOMMY A. LARSEN is further charged with (a) knowingly conspiring to provide funds to PinnFund through fraudulent equipment leases; (b) conspiring to skim and conceal a portion of the fraudulent lease proceeds by various means, including transportation of those  proceeds to a bank in Gibraltar; (c) committing  perjury before the United States District Court of the Southern District of California, suborning the perjury of a witness before a federal grand jury, and conspiring to obstruct justice by presenting false testimony from yet another witness before the District Court; and (d) evading his 1999 and 2000 federal income taxes by charging personal expenditures to PinnFund, structuring his compensation to avoid payroll taxes, and hiding the proceeds of illicit activity overseas.       Following his indictment, TOMMY A. LARSEN was arrested by the FBI with the assistance of the Escondido Police Department and is scheduled to be arraigned  before a federal magistrate judge on Friday, January 31, 2003, at 1:30 p.m.  KIM A. LARSEN, JAMES L. HILLMAN, and PIOTR KODZIS will be arraigned  before a federal magistrate judge on Tuesday, February 4, 2003, at 10:30 a.m.     United States Attorney Carol C. Lam said,  ""We are holding accountable those who committed one of the largest frauds to have occurred in San Diego history.   The United States Attorney's Office is committed to pursuing these complex cases and ensuring that those who commit financial crimes are brought to justice.""      The criminal investigation into PinnFund has previously yielded four other criminal convictions:     1. On March 22, 2002,   Michael J. Fanghella, former Chief Executive Officer of PinnFund, pled guilty to criminal charges that he operated PinnFund as a $300+ million Ponzi scheme that consistently lost money but was able to continue operations by attracting new investment capital and credit through, among other means, the creation of false financial statements and loan volume reports.  Fanghella is scheduled to be sentenced on February 3, 2003, and faces up to thirty years' imprisonment.     2. On August 23, 2002,   John D. Garitta, former Chief Financial Officer of PinnFund, pled guilty to criminal charges that he conspired with Fanghella to perpetuate the fraud by deceiving investors through the preparation and dissemination of false company financial statements.  Garitta is scheduled to be sentenced on April 14, 2003, and faces up to thirty years' imprisonment.     3. On August 23, 2002,  John C. Bykowski, a former administrative assistant at PinnFund, pled guilty to charges that he conspired with Fanghella, Garitta, and others to make cash withdrawals from PinnFund for the personal benefit of PinnFund executives, with the intent to conceal that cash income from the Internal Revenue Service.  Bykowski is also scheduled to be sentenced on April 14, 2003, and faces up to five years' imprisonment.     4. On December 3, 2002,  Kimberly A. Hulihee pled guilty to charges that she lied to a federal grand jury investigating PinnFund and its subsidiary, PinnLease USA, Inc.  Hulihee is scheduled to be sentenced on March 3, 2003, and faces up to five years' imprisonment.      Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kevin J. Kelly and Sanjay Bhandari and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Nick Morgan are assigned to the prosecution.  The cases are the result of a joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Inspector General.      Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge William Gore stated, ""Today's developments in the PinnFund Investigation are the result of an extensive and intensive multi-agency investigation that should send a message to all those who would engage in such complex and fraudulent schemes.  Do not expect to go undetected or unpunished.  The renewed focus of the FBI and other agencies on such crime throughout the nation, especially at the corporate level, will continue to receive the same priority attention given this successful, yet continuing, investigation.""   Denise L. Rubin, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge for San Diego, stated, ""The personal greed of those responsible for the massive PinnFund fraud is directly linked  to the collapse of the corporation, the evasion of taxes, and investors losses of  millions of dollars.  The financial ruin caused by these types of crimes is devastating, and IRS Criminal Investigation will continue to aggressively investigate corporate officers who are involved in financial crimes.""     Kenneth M. Donohue, Inspector General, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in Washington, D.C. stated that ""The Ponzi scheme that was discovered at PinnFund represented one of the largest investment fraud cases in Southern California.  The Office of Inspector General for HUD is committed to investigating fraudulent activities and will aggressively pursue any person or entity responsible for the use of false financial statements to perpetrate fraud involving HUD programs.""

GX249-20-2677164	"April 07, 2002          Human Tragedy Brings Tough Decisions for Judges         By  GARY JAHRIG  of the Missoulian     April 7, 2002         When someone takes the life of another person through negligence, what should happen? It's a question even seasoned judges and lawyers have a tough time answering           Since taking his place on the bench as a Missoula District Court judge more than a dozen years ago, Ed McLean has passed sentence on an array of murderers, rapists, thieves, habitual drunken drivers and other felons.         But McLean readily admits that he's hard-pressed to remember a judgment he's had to make that was as gut-wrenching as the negligent homicide sentence he handed down in February to William Andrew Johnson, who killed James Neumayer, 22, his 1-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn, and 18-year-old Amber Knutsen in June 2000 when his car crossed the centerline on U.S. Highway 93 South near Lolo and smashed head-on into two other vehicles.         ""That was as tough as they get,"" McLean said. ""You had good families and totally innocent people whose lives were taken. But at the same time, you had a person with an illness"" who caused the accident.         Johnson had blacked out moments before the wreck after suffering a diabetic reaction caused by his failure to take appropriate medication to control his blood-sugar level. After months of negotiations, Johnson avoided going to trial on the negligent homicide charge by reaching a plea agreement with the Missoula County Attorney's Office.         McLean sentenced Johnson to nine years on probation. He barred him from ever driving again and warned him that if he violates conditions of his probation by driving, he could spend up to 60 years in prison.         The sentence meant the 48-year-old Johnson, who was not jailed prior to his sentencing, would spend no time behind bars for killing three people.         Johnson's case is a prime illustration of the inconsistent nature of negligent homicide sentences, where defendants can be incarcerated for 20 years, or not at all, for killing one or more people.         Almost to a person, those in the legal profession who deal regularly with people who commit the most serious criminal offenses - judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and probation officers - agree that punishing felons convicted of negligent homicide is an extremely difficult task.         ""You don't read the presentence report on a negligent homicide just once. You have to read it and weigh the circumstances at least two or three times,"" McLean said. ""Negligent homicide is probably the toughest sentence to impose.""         The Johnson case is one of three highly publicized negligent homicide cases involving vehicle-related deaths that have been adjudicated in Missoula over the past two months. The cases were all similar in that they involved drivers of vehicles being responsible for the deaths of innocent parties.         But the similarities end there. The circumstances surrounding the deaths and the punishments handed down to the three convicted killers by three different judges vary greatly.         While Johnson escaped incarceration, Michelle Herd, a 28-year-old Washington woman who killed four members of the Good family of Seeley Lake - Stacy, 53, Kilty, 22, Arundel, 18, and Tully, 13 - in a fiery crash near Potomac in December 2000, received six months in a prerelease center and a lifetime ban on driving.         Angela Shultz, a 21-year-old Missoula woman who killed 12-year-old Larry Pyette last May while driving drunk, got what amounted to a five-year sentence in which she will likely spend time in prison, a state boot camp and a prerelease center.         Shultz was the only one of the three who was intoxicated at the time of the fatal incident. Herd was driving down the wrong side of a two-lane highway in a fatigued state as she rushed to her critically ill mother's hospital bedside. Johnson simply failed to take care of himself.         The only other common denominator in the cases was that the negligence of Johnson, Herd and Shultz all resulted in tragedy and had devastating affects on the family and friends of the victims.         Larson said the reason that negligent homicide sentences are harder to predict is simply the people charged with the offenses. That the three most recently resolved cases in Missoula had different outcomes comes as no surprise to the nine-year District Court judge.         ""You look at any three negligent homicide cases and you will find a wide range of sentences,"" Larson said. ""No two defendants are at all alike. Their ages, experiences in the criminal justice system and circumstances of the actual accidents vary greatly. And the much larger role of the victim's family in sentencing could also account for the difference. ... And with negligent homicide, the sentences generally have an individual component that the judge puts in that is not in the presentence report.""         Under Montana law, the offense of negligent homicide occurs when a ""person negligently causes the death of another human being."" It carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.         Referred to as negligent homicide in Montana, the same or similar offense in other states is often called manslaughter. Other states also have vehicular homicide statutes on the books, which covers deaths caused only through driving negligence.         While many of the defendants charged with negligent homicide in Montana have killed someone through their driving, the Montana charge can be applied to an array of accidental deaths ranging from hunting accidents to parents leaving children unattended in vehicles.         ""In general, there are two kinds of negligence that lead to negligent homicide charges,"" said Karen Townsend, the chief deputy Missoula County attorney and a 25-year prosecutor. ""There are acts of commission like drunk driving where you end up causing a traffic fatality. Or the other is acts of omission, like where you fail to provide medical care to an injured baby.         ""When you are talking negligence, you must show not just ordinary negligence. ... You must prove reckless disregard or what the law calls gross negligence. It's a pretty high standard.""         According to statistics calculated by the Missoulian from a state Department of Corrections database, in the past 12 years, 171 people have died as a result of negligent homicide in Montana in 37 counties. Perhaps reflecting population centers, the most deaths occurred in Yellowstone (17), Flathead and Lake counties (16 each), Cascade (15), Missoula (13) and Lewis and Clark (11).         Of the 158 people convicted in that time, 33 of them went to prison for stays ranging from three to 20 years. Three-quarters of those got 10-year sentences.         Another 49 received prison terms with some time suspended. Thirty-four of them got 10-year sentences, and 25 of them served at least half their sentence incarcerated.         One in five of those convicted were between 15 and 20 years old, and just over half were under 30. The number of negligent homicide incidents declines by age until the mid-30s, when the graph shows a spike among 36-45-year-olds.         Younger felons are much less likely to spend time in prison than their middle-aged counterparts. Those between 15 and 20 went to jail one out of every three incidents, while those between 36 and 40 were sentenced to prison 68 percent of the time. Of those between 46 and 50, just one out of five avoided prison in their sentence.         Townsend and others in the criminal justice system say the disparity between age and serving prison time is primarily due to the fact that older people are more likely to have criminal records prior to their negligent homicide convictions.         ""If a person has a criminal record in their past, there's more of a chance you will ask for some sort of incarceration,"" Townsend said.         Another variable in negligent homicide cases, Townsend said, is the fact that Montana does not have sentencing guidelines, which permits judges to ""take into account individual nuances about each case.""         ""With negligent homicide, you have a wide variety of different people committing the same offense. The facts of the case differ in all cases,"" she said. ""But you must ask 'do the acts committed rise to the level of the charge.' You do that for every case, but you don't ask the question unless there has been a death.""         Margaret Borg, Missoula County's chief public defender, has represented numerous people charged with negligent homicide in her more than 25 years as a defense attorney. She agrees wholeheartedly with her colleagues that negligent homicide is among the most unpredictable sentences.         ""I think the hardest thing for me to control ... is the wild card of what the victim's family demands,"" Borg said.         In all negligent homicide cases, the victim's survivors are consulted extensively before sentencing and are given the right to speak at sentencing hearings. As a defense attorney, the wishes of the victim's family often play a role in how Borg defends her clients.         Often with negligent homicide sentences, the end result can simply be another message against drinking and driving, Borg said. But she's not sure if such a message is very effective.         ""The people who wouldn't do that sort of thing anyway are the ones who hear the message the loudest,"" Borg said. ""The ones most likely involved in that type of behavior don't hear the message. I'm not sure the audience it's directed at actually gets the message. It sends the right message, but whether it affects the right audience is questionable.""         After spending 30 years working as a probation and parole officer, Sam Lemaich is not easily surprised when it comes to felony sentences.         Except when it comes to negligent homicide.         ""Negligent homicide is definitely one of the most unpredictable,"" said Lemaich, the Missoula-based regional administrator of probation and parole. ""You just never know because there are so many variables not there in so many other offenses.""         The Johnson case, for example, charted completely new ground for Lemaich and his staff - the people responsible for preparing presentence reports for District Court judges.         ""I've been doing this 30 years, but the diabetic case was a real twist for me,"" he said. ""This was not someone who did something like drink or take drugs. This happened because he didn't do something. In 30 years I never saw one like that.""         So Lemaich wasn't all that surprised when Judge McLean did not follow the presentence report prepared by his office for the Johnson case.         ""We recommended something completely different than what the judge did,"" Lemaich said. ""We recommended commitment to the Department of Corrections with the idea of him being placed in a prerelease center. He ended up getting a deferred sentence. But in negligent homicide there are so many facts and emotions to consider, you can never be sure.""         What Lemaich and his staffers try to do is give a judge as much background information on a defendant as possible before sentencing takes place. They also make a recommendation on every felony sentence that goes before a judge.         After a defendant either pleads guilty or is convicted of a felony offense, a probation officer is assigned the task of preparing an extensive presentence report.         ""All felony cases have presentence investigations,"" Lemaich said. ""The investigation is a pretty important document for everybody involved. It's supposed to be the independent, objective voice in the situation. The county attorney and the defendant have vested interests. And judges are not bound by plea bargains. We gather a lot of information and present it to the judge with a recommendation.""         Presentence reports are generally extensive investigative documents that can take up to 30 hours to prepare when it comes to negligent homicide cases. The probation officer preparing the report first summarizes police reports, county attorney files and past interviews with the defendant. They then have the defendant fill out an extensive questionnaire and conduct further interviews with the subject to be sentenced.         Lemaich said the reports also contain the defendant's complete criminal history and a social history that includes places of residence, past employment and family background. The officer also tries to speak to spouses and other family members about the defendant.         Once the personal background is complete, the probation officer turns to the victim's family and friends.         ""In the case of negligent homicide or rape, we put a lot of emphasis on victim impact,"" he said. ""We contact the survivors of victims and talk to them personally and offer them an opportunity to send letters to express their feelings. ... A lot of times they are very angry.""         When the presentence report is complete, it is placed in a sealed envelope and presented to the judge before the defendant's sentencing hearing.         ""Part of the reason negligent homicide sentences are all over the board is that no two are the same and no two judges are the same,"" Lemaich said. ""You have all this extraneous information put in the pot and the judge has to process it. Ultimately the judge makes the decision. In 90 percent of other felonies, the judge follows the presentence recommendations. But in negligent homicide, I don't know. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.""         Lemaich said that after spending some 30 hours preparing a recommendation, it's only human nature for probation officers to become personally attached to the case.         ""I would be lying to say that the probation officer is not vested in these. They put a lot of time into it,"" Lemaich said. ""It can be emotionally draining. But we're just one part of the judicial system. Judges are judges. ... It's their job to make the ultimate decision.""         With prisons bursting at the seams and courtroom calendars packed on a daily basis, it's not uncommon for the average felon to get three strikes before prison enters the equation.         ""As a general rule, a person can commit three felonies before they end up in prison,"" Judge McLean said.         A first conviction usually earns the defendant a deferred sentence, where the charge can be stricken from their record if they follow the terms of their sentence and commit no further crimes during that time period. The second felony generally is worth a suspended sentence, McLean said, where the conviction remains on the defendant's record, but no prison time is required if they stay out of trouble. A third trip before the judge on a felony offense typically opens the prison doors.         ""The two places we make exceptions are deliberate homicide and sexual assault,"" McLean said. ""If a person inflicts that type of injury intentionally ... then we're talking of an infliction that causes both emotional and physical injuries. That normally means prison.""         Then there's negligent homicide, where even judges admit sentencing is a highly unpredictable business.         ""Negligent homicide is definitely the exception to the rule,"" McLean said. ""You could go to prison for negligent homicide or you could not. There's just so many variables to consider.""         McLean said when negligent homicide occurs, it usually falls into one of two categories.         ""More often than not, the accident involves taking the life of a loved one or family member. Then you have the victim's family telling you the driver has been punished enough,"" McLean said. ""Or there are ones where you have someone under the influence of alcohol taking the life of a stranger. That completely changes things and you have people asking for incarceration.         ""The problem you have in a lot of negligent homicides is that you have someone coming before the court that does not have a criminal history. You have a law-abiding citizen who made a one-time mistake that turned out tragic. It's a whole different ball game with someone who has a prior conviction for drunken driving.""         McLean said judges must carefully weigh the value of taking a human life with the assurance that the defendant will not have the opportunity to commit such an act again.         ""The bottom line when you get through it all is what is the likelihood of this happening again. There's no question there has to be some cost of taking the life of an innocent person. But when it's done accidentally, what do you do? What's very difficult is that you know the poor victim's family has suffered such a loss and when you take the loss into account, you want to make certain it never happens again.""         Judge Larson said the presentence report is a vital tool when deciding a negligent homicide sentence.         ""(Probation officers) are well trained and take it very serious. They are very independent and are not tied to one side or the other,"" Larson said. ""Generally presentence reports take 30 minutes to read. With negligent homicide you spend more time. And you generally give negligent homicide cases a separate hearing that doesn't run in the regular law and motion format. I think it's helpful for the defendant and the victim's family to have a separate time with nothing else going on.""         While he relies heavily on presentence reports, Larson is quick to point out that judges are not bound by it, just as they are not required to follow the terms of plea agreements struck between prosecutors and defense attorneys.         ""The report gives you a start. But negligent homicide sentences generally have an individual component that the judge puts in that is not in the report,"" he said.         For example in the Herd case, Larson added a stipulation not in the presentence report that bars Herd from holding a driver's license for at least 40 years - a part of the sentence that was applauded by surviving members of the Good family.              Finally, the wishes of the victim's family must also be considered before imposing sentence, Larson said, particularly when multiple deaths occur, such as the Herd case where four members of the same family perished as a result of the defendant's negligence.         ""When you get into multiple deaths, it's even more important to look at the victim's family and find out where they are at. In a multiple death scenario, the function of the sentence is often therapeutic and helps close the case for the victim's family,"" Larson said.         ""The much larger role of the victim's family in negligent homicide cases could account for the differences in sentences. ... You want an example to be underlined so future conduct will be set for the community.""         Both Larson and McLean also said they realize that family members of victims are not always thinking clearly when it comes time to hand out punishment.         ""You see some anger and frustration, but I think a lot of it is they are acting out of grief,"" Larson said. ""I don't think you see a lot of vindictiveness in negligent homicide cases.

GX029-39-10842036	"Sept. 29, 2000       Greene County man sentenced to eight years in connection with $6 million investment Ponzi scheme    Springfield, Mo. -- A Greene County man was sentenced to eight years in prison today after pleading guilty to criminal charges that he operated a $6 million environmental investment scheme that paid early investors with money paid by later investors. Schemes that pay early investors with later investors' money are known as Ponzi schemes.    Dale Wayne McCurry (DOB - 1/2/59), of Fair Grove, was indicted on 13 counts last February by a Greene County grand jury at the request of Attorney General Jay Nixon, whose office then prosecuted the case. Nixon said that from 1994 through 1998, McCurry solicited investments totaling more than $6 million from more than 200 investors, some of whom invested as much as $447,000.    McCurry told investors he was operating a successful environmental business that purchased ""waste-eating micro-bacterial bugs."" McCurry used the proceeds from later sales to pay off early investors to create the facade that the business operations of McCurry Environmental Solutions were financially successful.     Greene County Circuit Judge Don E. Burrell Jr. sentenced McCurry to eight years in prison after McCurry pleaded guilty to four counts of securities fraud, three counts of selling unregistered securities, two counts of selling securities as an unregistered agent, three counts of stealing by deceit and one count of passing a bad check.     McCurry's Missouri sentence will run concurrent to the five years remaining on federal convictions for mail fraud and money laundering related to the scheme. He was returned to federal prison after being sentenced today.                                 Missouri Revised Statutes        Sept. 29, 2000"

The four count indictment, returned yesterday and unsealed today, charges Michelle Leigh Dunn, 21, Jerry Lynn Jones, 25, and Robert Marion Treece, 24, with conspiring to set fire to the Universal Church of God on May 25, 1995.  Treece also faces charges of intimidating a witness in connection with a subsequent investigation of the incident.    ""Today's case underscores our ongoing commitment to find and prosecute those who attack our nation's houses of worship,"" said James E. Johnson, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Co-Chairs of the National Church Arson Task Force.      The first three counts of the indictment charges the three defendants with conspiring to set fire to a mobile home trailer used by the church as a Christian school in order to intimidate African-American members of the church.  Count four charges Treece with threatening a witness in order to prevent the communication of information about the fire to federal law enforcement officers.    The maximum possible prison term for all of the charges returned against Dunn, Jones, and Treece is forty years in prison.  In addition to prison terms, each defendant could also be sentenced to fines of $250,000 for each count of the indictment.    The indictment was the result of a joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  The investigation began in August 1997, after the fire at the Universal Church of God.  The Task Force also opened an investigation into an earlier fire at the church that had been set in May, 1995.  The second fire remains under investigation.         More than 600 hundred arsons of houses of worship have been reported to the Church Arson Task Force since January 1995.  Already, 273 suspects have been arrested in connection with 204 arsons.    An indictment is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   # # #     98-183"
GX026-57-11276207	"Spammers Are Target of AG Lawsuit                    SEATTLE - July 11, 2002 - Attorney General Christine Gregoire today filed          a lawsuit against two Minnesota men whose e-mail pitches for debt consolidation          services could mislead some people to think their credit ratings are at          risk.                                               Complaint                                                 COMPLAINT                FOR INJUNCTIVE AND ADDITIONAL RELIEF UNDER THE UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES--CONSUMER                PROTECTION ACT AND THE UNSOLICITED ELECTRONIC MAIL ACT                  ChippynetComplaintforRelief.pdf                 (83K .PDF)                                       The lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, accuses Samuel and          Adam Meltzer and their companies, Chippynet.com and Mobydns.com, of sending          possibly thousands of deceptive e-mails to Washington residents in violation          of the state's groundbreaking anti-spam law.         The lawsuit alleges the Meltzers use deceptive subject lines, such as          ""Payment Past Due,"" ""Check Unclaimed,"" and ""URGENT          - Account Update,"" to entice recipients to open the e-mails.          The e-mail directs consumers to a website that promotes debt consolidation          services. Investigators say the websites change names frequently to avoid          easy detection.         ""As with most e-mail spam, the defendants try to make people believe          they are receiving important information from a business with which they          already have a relationship. Instead, consumers find nothing but a commercial          pitch,"" Gregoire said         The Meltzers, the lawsuit alleges, also use deceptive sender information          in the ""from"" field of the e-mails, such as ""Collections          Department"" and ""Payment Department.""           ""When e-mail spam is misleading and deceptive, it's more than just          annoying. In Washington, it's illegal. This action serves as notice to          spammers that they could face lawsuits if they send deceptive messages          to Washington consumers, "" Gregoire said.         The lawsuit contends the e-mails violate the state's Unsolicited Electronic          Mail Act, which outlaws misleading and deceptive subject lines and false          sender information that conceals the e-mails' true source.                    The Attorney General's Office has received about 19 complaints about the          unsolicited e-mails from the Meltzers, and attorneys suspect that thousands          of Washington residents have received illegal e-mail messages from the          pair.         Attorneys are asking for a court order permanently barring further deceptive          commercial e-mails and are seeking an unspecified amount of civil penalties.         The lawsuit is just the latest effort by Gregoire's office to combat          illegal e-mail spam.           The Attorney General's Office is currently developing a comprehensive          program to educate the public about what type of unsolicited commercial          e-mail violates the law and what consumers can do to avoid it.          Specifically, the law prohibits unsolicited commercial e-mail that contains          misleading information in its subject line, uses a third party's domain          name without permission or misrepresents the message's point of origin.         To avoid it, consumers should avoid submitting their e-mail address online,          refrain from responding to any spam e-mail, and should create separate          e-mail accounts and screen names - one for private, personal use and the          other to make online purchases or to visit chatrooms.          In September, a trial in the first case to be brought against an e-mail          spammer is scheduled to begin in King County Superior Court. That case          has been pending while the state's Unsolicited Electronic Mail Act, which          was passed by the Legislature in 1998, was challenged.

Felix and Mercedes Navarrete, their daughter Joann Frederick,                      30, and associate Pedro Miramontes, 51, were being held on                      a total of 28 felony counts involving theft, said Detective                      Gene Arreola of the Los Angeles Police Department's Financial                      Crimes Division.                     They were being held at Van Nuys jail in lieu of $1 million                      bail each.                     Felix Navarrete, 70, and his wife Mercedes, 54, were initially                      arrested in April in the case, but no charges were filed then                       because of incomplete evidence, Arreola said.                     Arreola declined to detail the charges against the Navarretes,                      their daughter and the fourth suspect prior to the arraignment,                      which he said would occur within 72 hours.                     But he said the case built on allegations that were made                      public when the Navarretes were first arrested. At that time,                      police called Luz de Oro - in Spanish, Light of Gold - a ""complex,                      endless chain scheme"" that promised new cars and homes                      to people but rarely delivered. Police said the club had some                      25,000 members, thousands of whom invested at least $2,000.                      Some were bilked of more than $20,000, according to police.                     People became eligible for the club's ""automobile program""                      after investing about $3,800 and signing up at least seven                      new members, police said in April. Some victims drove sport                      utility vehicles off car lots under the mistaken impression                      Luz de Oro would pay for them; police said the cars were usually                      bought under deferred payment plans and no payments were made.                     Many of the cars have now been repossessed.                                                                                                                                                    • Securities   • Franchises  •  Off-Exchange Commodities  • Investment and Financial Services •  • Independent Escrows  • Consumer and Commercial Finance Lending  • Residential Mortgage Lending •         Back to Top of Page                © 2003 State of California.

U.S. District Court Judge David H. Coar sentenced Taurino Armando Brito-Sotelo, 36, to 63 months in prison, according to Elissa A. Brown, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago office of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Patrick Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.    Counterfeit document production is a precursor to a myriad of crimes that defraud local and state institutions of significant revenue and undermine our national security, said Elissa A. Brown, Special Agent-in-Charge of ICE in Chicago. ICE is committed to making the largest possible impact through our investigations to disrupt and dismantle this criminal activity.    Brito-Sotelo and his co-conspirators were the targets of a year-long investigation conducted by ICE agents into a major counterfeit-document ring operating at the Mega Mall, a discount shopping center located at 2500 N. Milwaukee in Chicago. During the investigation, undercover ICE agents purchased counterfeit identity documents at the Mega Mall, including fake green cards and social security cards. It was determined that ringleader Brito-Sotelo, an illegal alien himself, received a $50 cut from each set of documents made and sold, with an estimated 3 to 5 sets purchased each day.     Counterfeit identity documents sell on the street for approximately $80 per set, which includes a fake social security card and green card, and are routinely manufactured and sold to undocumented aliens who use them to gain unlawful employment and conceal their true identity. Fraudulent documents are also sold and purchased to evade the law by developing multiple identities. As part of the conspiracy, the documents were produced at various locations in Chicago, including 2953 W. Fullerton, transported back to the Mega Mall, and sold to illegal aliens.      In January 2003, ICE agents arrested Brito-Sotelo and three other vendors and seized several hundred counterfeit green cards and social security cards. A fifth individual was arrested on December 4. Brito-Sotelo is the third individual to be sentenced for his involvement in operating this fraud scheme.    ###             ICE, the primary investigative arm of the Department of Homeland               Security, was established to bring a unified focus to the enforcement               of U.S. immigration and customs laws, with the principal goal of               preventing violations by terrorists and other criminals who threaten           the nation's security.                                Last Modified 12/09/2003                        ABOUT           |  NEWS ROOM  |  ENFORCEMENT  |  CAREERS            Threat Level  |  Home  |  Text  |  Site Map  |  Search  |  FOIA  |  Legal  |  Firstgov |  DHS
GX235-67-7869960	"Stock Swindlers Sentenced   Author Tom Clancy Lost $1.7 Million     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  April 14, 2000   Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr. announced today the sentencing of two individuals in a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme that listed among its victims author and Baltimore Orioles minority owner, Tom Clancy.  Edward Pereira, 35, and Jeffrey Goodman, 47, were sentenced on their previous pleas of guilty to multiple counts of conspiracy and stock fraud by the Honorable G. R. Hovey Johnson.  Pereira was sentenced to three years in prison, all but six months suspended, to be served at the Prince George's County Detention Center, and fined $10,000, all but $3500 suspended, to be paid over a period of three years probation. Goodman's sentence was suspended to probation.  Richard Scott, 54, who is terminally ill, will appear for sentencing at a date to be determined, pending receipt of medical information.   Scott, who lives in Alexandria, Va., and Pereira, who lives in North Beach, Md., entered Alford pleas - in which they did not admit guilt but did acknowledge that the State had sufficient evidence to convict them - after five weeks of testimony and on the eve of the case going to the jury.  Goodman, who also lives in Alexandria, Va., pleaded guilty on the first day of his January trial.  His plea was pursuant to a cooperation agreement in which he agreed to testify against his co-defendants.    In the trial, 25 victims testified to an elaborate scheme run by the defendants out of their Camp Springs, Md. coin and stamp store called Goldies.  Promising returns of 15% and above, the defendants sold ""interests"" in two investment ""accounts"".    The first, called the Fifteen Per Cent Account, was supposed to be an investment in valuable coin estates, on which Goldies promised a guaranteed 15% return.  The second investment, called the Stock Account, involved the buying and selling of stocks, particularly initial public offerings.  Despite the glowing reports of profits and handsome returns paid out to some investors, the investments were not made as promised.     ""In the five years that the scheme was in operation, 1990 to 1995, fewer than five coin estates were purchased by Goldies,"" General Curran said.  ""Similarly, little of the promised stock was actually purchased and that which was lost money.  Investor's money was instead used to pay off earlier investors and to finance the defendants' lavish lifestyles, which included frequent gambling junkets to Atlantic City, Las Vegas and local casinos.""   Although the defendants took in over $8 million in investor funds, by the time Goldies went into bankruptcy in late 1995, it had less than $100,000 in coin and stamp inventory and stock holdings of less than $400,000.   Author Tom Clancy invested well over $1 million in both Goldies Accounts.  Other victims included doctors, psychologists, a carpenter, a bartender, government workers and retired military personnel.   At the sentencing hearing today, evidence was presented of Scott's declining health, due to the ravages of diabetes, liver and kidney failure, congestive heart failure and poor circulation.  Because of his poor health, the trial, which was originally scheduled for June of last year, had to be postponed to January of this year.  All parties agreed that his health has declined since completion of the trial, which is why the court wanted additional medical information.

GX017-18-10876851	For Immediate Release    February 28, 2003          SECURITIES FRAUD TASK FORCE OBTAINS NDICTMENT OF MULTIPLE FELONY CHARGES AGAINST  SEVEN DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING A CLEARWATER ATTORNEY, IN $18.4 MILLION PONZI SCHEME    Paul I. Perez, United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida,  announced today that a Federal Grand Jury in Tampa returned a Superseding Indictment  charging seven defendants with multiple crimes. This Superseding Indictment represents  the continuing efforts of the Security Fraud Task Force, a federal and state task  force which has been investigating and prosecuting both national and international,  large-scale securities fraud for seven years. The Superseding Indictment charges  seven persons with a number of crimes, including conspiracy to commit securities  fraud, to sell unregistered securities, and to commit mail fraud (18 U.S.C. 371).  The defendants are also charged with securities fraud (15 U.S.C.  78J(b)); selling  unregistered securities (15 U.S.C.  77e(a)); mail fraud (18 U.S.C.  1341); money  laundering conspiracy (18 U.S.C.  1956(h)); engaging in illegal monetary transactions  (18 U.S.C.  1957); and laundering of monetary instruments (18 U.S.C.  1956(a)(1)(A)(i)).      The statutory maximum penalties for conspiracy and mail fraud are five years  incarceration, a $250,000 fine, and three years supervised release. The statutory  maximum penalties for securities fraud are ten years incarceration, a $1,000,000  fine and five years supervised release. The statutory maximum penalties for  selling unregistered securities are five years incarceration, a $10,000 fine,  and three years supervised release. The statutory maximum penalties for engaging  in illegal monetary transactions are ten years incarceration, a $250,000 fine,  and three years supervised release. The statutory maximum penalties for the  money laundering related offenses are twenty years incarceration, a $500,000  fine, and three years supervised release.     The defendants named in the Superseding Indictment are Gregory G. Schultz, an  attorney, age 54, of Clearwater; Danny L. Wey, age 54, of Dunedin; Joseph Cuciniello,  age 54, of Oldsmar; Dean A. Sinibaldi, age 43,of Fort Myers; Anthony Cuciniello,  Jr., age 59, of Odessa; Robert M. Phillips, age 53, of Palmetto; and Gene A. Tyrrell,  age 53,of Glendale, Arizona.    The Superseding Indictment alleges that the defendants orchestrated the sale of  more than $18 million in fraudulent, worthless securities in the Middle District  of Florida and twenty-one other states in the United States. The Superseding  Indictment charges that beginning in September 1996 and continuing through August  2000, in the Middle District of Florida, and elsewhere, the defendants devised  a scheme to defraud investors. The defendants and others who conspired with them  sold securities in the form of promissory notes, participation agreements, and  stock certificates to victims who often invested their life savings. The defendants  created false and fraudulent promotional materials and offering documents which  described investment opportunities in these securities. According to the Superseding  Indictment, the defendants disseminated the materially false materials utilizing  the United States mail, private and commercial carriers, and direct sales pitches  to investors, utilizing stock brokers, insurance agents and financial consultants.  The defendants promised the investors they would be purchasing high quality securities  which would pay a high rate of return. In many instances, the defendants also  falsely promised that the securities were guaranteed and that the investors could  not lose their principal investments. In reality, up to seventy percent of the  investor funds were diverted, rather that invested as promised.     According to the Superseding Indictment, the investments were marketed under  a variety of names, including Millennium Investment, Inc. Trust and The Stonehenge  Group.     Upon obtaining the investor funds, the defendants moved the money to bank accounts  which they controlled and converted much of the money to their own uses. As a  result of the defendants fraudulent activities, more than 300 investors, throughout  twenty-one states, lost more than $18 million.     United States Attorney Perez commended the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the  United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Florida Comptrollers Office  in Tampa, for their successful and continuing collaboration with the United States  Attorneys Office on this Task Force. Mr. Perez stated, This multi-agency effort,  focusing of persons involved in securities fraud throughout the Middle District  of Florida and elsewhere, is an example of the ongoing efforts by law enforcement  to combat investor fraud.     This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Michael E.  Runyon and Rachelle DesVauxBedke of the General Crimes Section of the United States  Attorneys Office.     An indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed a violation  of federal criminal laws. Every defendant is presumed innocent until, and unless,  proven guilty.

""Pyramid scheme activity spread through New Mexico like a virus from late    2000 to mid-2001.   During that time I repeatedly warned the public that such    schemes were illegal and money would be lost.  Unfortunately for many, the warnings    were not heeded.  Many New Mexicans lost money to the scheme.  And a number    of people have been convicted of felonies for promoting the scheme,"" Attorney    General Madrid said.     To date, only one individual charged with violations of the Pyramid Promotional    Act has chosen to go to a jury, and she lost her case.  On June 27, 2003, Sandra    Mirabal was convicted of three counts of violating the Pyramid Promotional Act.     Mirabal, an Albuquerque business owner, was targeting women with a scheme call    ""Women Empowering Women"" and ""The Gifting Circle.""  Mirabal    will be sentenced in December 2003.   Fourteen individuals have accepted plea agreements in pyramid cases.  Eleven    have entered pre-prosecution diversion programs.  Eight have settled before    charges were filed in district court and trials against six others are pending.     In all cases, the defendants have been required to make restitution.     ""To date, more than $300,000 in restitution has been given to 168   victims    of pyramid schemes in our state.  I hope that New Mexicans statewide understand    that pyramid scheme activity is illegal.  People who promote this activity can    expect to be prosecuted.  Recently we notified a number of individuals that    we are preparing to take legal action against them.  Should these individuals    wish to avoid the likelihood of being indicted by a grand jury, they can contact    my office and avoid formal prosecution,"" Madrid said.    ""The pyramid schemes that took hold in New Mexico the last few years were    unlike the schemes we had seen in the past.  The schemes of the past typically    featured a few individuals making money from many individuals.  The variation    we were confronted with here was more like a    cottage industry.  Pyramid schemes were springing up all over with different    people controlling each scheme,"" Madrid added.  ""I would like to acknowledge    Assistant Attorney General Jody Curran for his tireless efforts to prosecute    pyramid offenses.  Jody was recently named Legal Impact Prosecutor of the Year    2002 by the Prosecutors Section of the State Bar in part for the strategy he    developed to prosecute these cases.""    ####"

SYLLABUS BY THE COURT              1.    “To trigger application of the 'plain error' doctrine, there must be (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.” Syllabus Point 7,  State v. Miller,  194 W.Va. 3, 459 S.E.2d 114 (1995).            2.    “An unpreserved error is deemed plain and affects substantial rights only if the reviewing court finds the lower court skewed the fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceedings in some major respect. In clear terms, the plain error rule should be exercised only to avoid a miscarriage of justice. The discretionary authority of this Court invoked by lesser errors should be exercised sparingly and should be reserved for the correction of those few errors that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.” Syllabus Point 7,  State v. LaRock,  196 W.Va. 294, 470 S.E.2d 613 (1996).            3.    “When offering evidence under Rule 404(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence, the prosecution is required to identify the specific purpose for which the evidence is being offered and the jury must be instructed to limit its consideration of the evidence to only that purpose. It is not sufficient for the prosecution or the trial court merely to cite or mention the litany of possible uses listed in Rule 404(b). The specific and precise purpose for which the evidence is offered must clearly be shown from the record and that purpose alone must be told to the jury in the trial court's instruction.” Syllabus Point 1,  State v. McGinnis,  193 W.Va. 147, 455 S.E.2d 516 (1994).             4.    “Where an offer of evidence is made under Rule 404(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence, the trial court, pursuant to Rule 104(a) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence, is to determine its admissibility. Before admitting the evidence, the trial court should conduct an  in camera  hearing as stated in  State v. Dolin , 176 W.Va. 688, 347 S.E.2d 208 (1986). After hearing the evidence and arguments of counsel, the trial court must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the acts or conduct occurred and that the defendant committed the acts. If the trial court does not find by a preponderance of the evidence that the acts or conduct was committed or that the defendant was the actor, the evidence should be excluded under Rule 404(b). If a sufficient showing has been made, the trial court must then determine the relevancy of the evidence under Rules 401 and 402 of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence and conduct the balancing required under Rule 403 of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence. If the trial court is then satisfied that the rule 404(b) evidence is admissible, it should instruct the jury on the limited purpose for which such evidence has been admitted. A limiting instruction should be given at the time the evidence is offered, and we recommend that it be repeated in the trial court's general charge to the jury at the conclusion of the evidence.” Syllabus Point 2,  State v. McGinnis,  193 W.Va. 147, 455 S.E.2d 516 (1994).             5.    “The function of an appellate court when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, is sufficient to convince a reasonable person of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Syllabus Point 1,  State v. Guthrie , 194 W.Va. 657, 461 S.E.2d 163 (1995).            6.    “A criminal defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction takes on a heavy burden. An appellate court must review all the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and must credit all inferences and credibility assessments that the jury might have drawn in favor of the prosecution. The evidence need not be inconsistent with every conclusion save that of guilt so long as the jury can find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Credibility determinations are for a jury and not an appellate court. Finally, a jury verdict should be set aside only when the record contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To the extent that our prior cases are inconsistent, they are expressly overruled.” Syllabus Point 3,  State v. Guthrie , 194 W.Va. 657, 461 S.E.2d 163 (1995).      Per Curiam:              This is an appeal from a June 8, 1998, final order of the Circuit Court of Monongalia County sentencing the appellant, Marc Scott (“Scott”), to a term of 25 years as a result of his jury conviction of second degree murder. Scott argues that the circuit court erred: (1) in allowing the medical examiner to state that the victim died by homicide; and (2) by admitting evidence in violation of  West Virginia Rules of Evidence  Rule 404(b). Scott also argues that the evidence presented below was insufficient to establish second degree murder. See footnote 1  1   Based upon our review of the record, the parties' arguments, and all matters submitted before this Court, we find that no error was committed by the court, and therefore, we affirm.      I.              On the night of October 18, 1997, Scott drank alcohol beverages with his neighbor Clarence Cassidy (“Cassidy”). Scott returned home and continued to drink. The next morning Scott experienced a “hangover;” nevertheless, he decided to go squirrel hunting at approximately 7:00 a.m. Scott testified that he walked up a path behind the trailer in which he resided, up to a ridge. Scott further testified that he decided to return to his trailer when he could not find any squirrels.            According to Scott, as he was returning to his trailer he saw “glimpses of red,” which Scott testified he believed to be a squirrel foraging for nuts. From approximately 50 yards away from what he believed to be a squirrel, Scott fired a .22 caliber weapon. Unfortunately, what Scott saw was not a squirrel. It was 16-year-old Brandon Rosenberger whom he shot in the head, and who died within moments of being shot.            Scott approached Rosenberger and checked his pulse, which quickly faded. Scott returned to his residence and hid his .22 caliber weapon under his trailer. Scott then returned to Cassidy's residence where he reportedly drank to intoxication.            Sometime later, two young boys discovered the body of Brandon Rosenberger and quickly informed one of the boys' father, LeRoy Wheeler. Mr. Wheeler, with his son, drove to the scene, and Mr. Wheeler checked Brandon Rosenberger for a pulse. He found none. While examining the victim, Mr. Wheeler heard two gunshots fired in his direction. The Wheelers quickly returned to their vehicle and reported the incident to the police.            Cassidy testified that he woke on the afternoon of October 19, 1997, to the sound of a gun being fired twice. After hearing the gunshots, Cassidy went to his porch where he found Scott standing, having just fired a 9mm handgun.            When the police arrived at the scene they found Brandon Rosenberger lying in the woods dead, with blood around his face, wearing jeans and a blue pullover.             The police then went to the Cassidy home where they were informed of the gunshots that Cassidy had heard, and were told that Scott had been there with a gun. The police next went to the home of Scott where they found Scott intoxicated. In Scott's trailer the police found a 9mm handgun behind the front door. They did not, at this time, find the .22 caliber weapon.            After being advised of his rights, Scott voluntarily went with a state trooper to the Morgantown state police detachment. While being transported, Scott denied firing a weapon that day. During an interview at the detachment, Scott changed his story and admitted that he fired shots from his 9mm handgun, but he denied owning a .22 caliber weapon. Scott also stated that he had heard gunshots and, after hearing the shots, he had investigated the area near his trailer and located the body of Brandon Rosenberger. Scott stated that he thought that Rosenberger was unconscious and left him alone.            On October 21, 1997, Scott changed his story, reporting to the police that he had owned a .22 caliber weapon, but had sold it 3 weeks prior to the shooting of Rosenberger. After Scott was informed that the police had evidence indicating that Scott had a .22 caliber weapon in his possession only 1 week prior to the death of Rosenberger, Scott again changed his story, admitting that he had the weapon before the shooting but had recently sold it.            Shortly thereafter, a search was conducted of the crime scene and the surrounding area. A .22 caliber weapon was located under Scott's trailer. On October 23, 1997, after the discovery of the weapon, Scott confessed to the shooting -- now claiming it was a hunting accident.             Scott was subsequently charged with first degree murder and, following a trial by jury, was found guilty of second degree murder. This appeal followed.                               II.  A.    Testimony of the State's Medical Examiner              The first issue on appeal is whether the trial court properly allowed the state medical examiner, Dr. Frost, to testify that Rosenberger's “manner of death” See footnote 2  2   was a “homicide.” Scott argues that by using the word “homicide,” the testimony of Dr. Frost was an opinion on an ultimate issue at trial -- whether the death of Brandon Rosenberger was due to an accident or due to murder.            Dr. Frost's testimony was not objected to during the course of the trial. However, Scott argues that although the testimony of Dr. Frost was not objected to, his testimony constitutes plain error that requires the conviction to be overturned.            We have held that “[t]o trigger application of the 'plain error' doctrine, there must be (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.” Syllabus Point 7,  State v. Miller,  194 W.Va. 3, 459 S.E.2d 114 (1995). We have further explained this doctrine and held that:           An unpreserved error is deemed plain and affects substantial rights only if the reviewing court finds the lower court skewed the fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceedings in some major respect. In clear terms, the plain error rule should be exercised only to avoid a miscarriage of justice. The discretionary authority of this Court invoked by lesser errors should be exercised sparingly and should be reserved for the correction of those few errors that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.     Syllabus Point 7,  State v. LaRock,  196 W.Va. 294, 470 S.E.2d 613 (1996).            In a plain error analysis, we first must determine whether the testimony of Dr. Frost, standing alone, would constitute error if admitted into evidence. Dr. Frost testified in relevant part, as follows:          Q. [by the State] Ultimately, Dr. Frost, what did you determine the cause of death to be?          A. Gunshot wound to the head.          Q. And is part of your determination in addition to cause of death, manner of death?          A. Yes, it is.          Q. Explain to the jury what the difference is between those two areas?          A. The cause of death is the injury or the disease process that causes someone's death. The manner of death is an opinion that deals with the circumstances under which death occurs. We have five manners of death; natural, accident, suicide, homicide and when you can't for all the investigation and all your determinations conclude whether it's one of the previous four, you use the category of undetermined. Which in most, many medical examiner coroners' offices is perhaps one or two percent of all your cases.          Q. Now, you've said that the cause of death in your determination was the gunshot wound, is that correct?          A. Yes.          Q. Did you have an opinion as to the manner of death in this case?          A. Yes.          Q. What was that opinion as you expressed it in your report?          A. Manner of death is homicide.          . . .           Q. [by the defense] Now, by stating that the manner of death was homicide, that doesn't rule out some type of accidental shooting by a second person, does it?          A. The information I had didn't seem to indicate that this was accidental.          . . .          A. I don't make the differentiations between the varying degrees of manslaughter, voluntary, involuntary which is a legal matter when I have a wound that was fatal and fired from a distance and another person purposely pulled the trigger to fire that shot.          Q. Okay. And whenever you say you don't make the differentiation, that's a legal conclusion as to whether it would first degree manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter or something else?          A. That's right. That's your realm, not mine.          Q. You're not able to sit here today and tell us which of those degrees would apply to the facts of this case, are you?          A. No, that is not my work. That is not my experience. That is not my training.            Scott contends that Dr. Frost's testimony was error in that it improperly invaded the province of the jury in that the testimony was on the ultimate issue, and was not sufficiently probative so as to assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence and determine a fact at issue. Scott contends that Dr. Frost's testimony basically instructed the jury on what conclusion to reach. Scott relies on  State v. Clark,  171 W.Va. 74, 297 S.E.2d 849 (1982), for the proposition that a state medical examiner may not testify that “homicide” was the manner of death in a case where the defendant's state of mind is at issue. See footnote 3  3              We note that  Clark  was decided prior to our 1985 adoption of Rule 704 of the  West Virginia Rules of Evidence . Rule 704 provides that “testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.” Additionally, this Court stated in  State v. Smith , 178 W.Va. 104, 358 S.E.2d 188 (1987), that with the adoption of Rule 704,  Clark  would not be controlling on the issue of an expert's ability to testify that homicide was the manner of death. See footnote 4  4   Scott's reliance on  Clark  is, consequently, misplaced. See footnote 5  5              Nevertheless, Scott argues that the use of the term “homicide” by Dr. Frost was misleading to the jury and that his testimony stripped Scott of his defense that the shooting was an accident. Homicide is the “killing of one human being by the act, procurement, or omission of another.”  Black's Law Dictionary  (6th ed. 1990). Homicide is not, in and of itself, a crime.            [Homicide] is a necessary ingredient of the crimes of murder and manslaughter, but there are other cases in which homicide may be committed without criminal intent and without criminal consequences. . . . The term “homicide” is neutral; while it describes the act, it pronounces no judgment on its moral or legal quality.     Black's Law Dictionary  (6th ed. 1990).            Because the term “homicide” is neutral and pronounces no judgment, we do not find that Dr. Frost testifying that Brandon Rosenberger's manner of death was homicide removed any defense available to Scott. In fact, Dr. Frost testified that his opinion was not a legal conclusion -- that he was neither trained nor qualified to render a legal conclusion concerning Brandon Rosenberger's death.             We do not find in the instant case that the circuit court committed an error in permitting Dr. Frost to testify that Rosenberger's manner of death was homicide; therefore, we need not go further with the  Miller  analysis to determine the effect such testimony may have had in the trial. See footnote 6  6        B.    Rule 404(b) Evidence              Scott next argues that the circuit court erred in permitting improper introduction of evidence under Rule 404(b) of the  West Virginia Rules of Evidence . Rule 404(b) provides:             Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he or she acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.            Concerning the admissibility of 404(b) evidence, we have stated:             When offering evidence under Rule 404(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence, the prosecution is required to identify the specific purpose for which the evidence is being offered and the jury must be instructed to limit its consideration of the evidence to only that purpose. It is not sufficient for the prosecution or the trial court merely to cite or mention the litany of possible uses listed in Rule 404(b). The specific and precise purpose for which the evidence is offered must clearly be shown from the record and that purpose alone must be told to the jury in the trial court's instruction.    Syllabus Point 1,  State v. McGinnis,  193 W.Va. 147, 455 S.E.2d 516 (1994).            Syllabus Point 2 of  McGinnis  states:             Where an offer of evidence is made under Rule 404(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence, the trial court, pursuant to Rule 104(a) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence, is to determine its admissibility. Before admitting the evidence, the trial court should conduct an in camera hearing as stated in  State v. Dolin , 176 W.Va. 688, 347 S.E.2d 208 (1986). After hearing the evidence and arguments of counsel, the trial court must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the acts or conduct occurred and that the defendant committed the acts. If the trial court does not find by a preponderance of the evidence that the acts or conduct was committed or that the defendant was the actor, the evidence should be excluded under Rule 404(b). If a sufficient showing has been made, the trial court must then determine the relevancy of the evidence under Rules 401 and 402 of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence and conduct the balancing required under Rule 403 of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence. If the trial court is then satisfied that the rule 404(b) evidence is admissible, it should instruct the jury on the limited purpose for which such evidence has been admitted. A limiting instruction should be given at the time the evidence is offered, and we recommend that it be repeated in the trial court's general charge to the jury at the conclusion of the evidence.                  In order to convict the defendant of second degree murder, See footnote 7  7   the prosecution was required to prove malice. See footnote 8  8   Malice is not easy to define. It has been “frequently used, but not extensively defined, by this Court.”  State v. Starkey,  161 W.Va. 517, 524, 244 S.E.2d 219, 223 (1978),  overruled on other grounds, State v. Guthrie , 194 W.Va. 657, 461 S.E.2d 163 (1995). In an attempt to define “malice” we stated:            [T]he source of . . . malice is not only confined to a particular ill will to the deceased, but is intended to denote . . . an action flowing from a wicked and corrupt motive, a thing done  malo animo , where the fact has been attended with such circumstances as carry in them the plain indications of a heart regardless of social duty, and fatally bent on mischief. And therefore malice is implied from any deliberate cruel act[.]     State v. Douglass,  28 W.Va. 297, 299 (1886).               Whether malice exists in a particular case is a question for the jury to determine -- “malice is a subjective condition of mind, discoverable only by words and conduct, and the significance of the words and conduct of an accused person, . . . addresses itself peculiarly to the consideration of the jury.” Syllabus Point 4,  State v. Hamrick,  112 W.Va. 157, 163 S.E. 868 (1932).                 The prosecution sought introduction of the 404(b) evidence under the theory that Scott did not accidentally shoot Brandon Rosenberger in a hunting accident, as the defendant claimed, and to prove malice. See footnote 9  9   The prosecution sought to show that Scott had a history of threats and violent acts, in an attempt to keep people away from his property. The 404(b) evidence included testimony that Scott had brandished and fired weapons in several instances in a threatening manner.            The prosecution filed a motion to introduce the 404(b) evidence, and a hearing was conducted pursuant to  McGinnis, supra. See footnote 10  10   The trial court, after a  McGinnis  analysis, concluded that: (1) the defendant had committed the acts; (2) that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial; and (3) that there existed similarities between each incident and the state's theory of what occurred. See footnote 11  11   We held in Syllabus Point 1 of  State v. Edward Charles L.,  183 W.Va. 641, 398 S.E.2d 123 (1990) that:             Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.            Furthermore, we review the admission of 404(b) evidence under an abuse of discretion standard and have stated that we review the introduction “in the light most favorable to the party offering the evidence, in this case the prosecution, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its prejudicial effect.”  McGinnis , 193 at 159, 455 S.E.2d at 528.            We note that the trial court was very careful in its examination of the proffered 404(b) evidence, adhering to the requirements set forth in  McGinnis . Scott does not argue that the trial court's factual determinations were incorrect, nor does he argue that the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on the limited purpose for which the 404(b) evidence was admitted. Rather, Scott argues that the trial court erred in admitting the 404(b) evidence, when the evidence was prejudicial and not sufficiently probative. See footnote 12  12              Rule 403 of the  West Virginia Rules of Evidence  provides “that although relevant, evidence may nevertheless be excluded when the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion, or undue delay is disproportionate to the value of the evidence.”  State v. Derr,  192 W.Va. 165, 178, 451 S.E.2d 731, 744 (1994) (citations omitted). However, we have also stated that Rule 404(b) is an “'inclusive rule' in which all relevant evidence involving other crimes or acts is admitted at trial unless the sole purpose for the admission is to show criminal disposition.”  State v. Edward Charles L.,  183 W.Va. 641, 647, 398 S.E.2d 123, 129 (1990) (citations omitted).            The record indicates that the trial court observed all of the requirements of  McGinnis . After determining that the acts or conduct occurred, and that Scott committed the acts, the trial court determined that the evidence was relevant and probative. See footnote 13  13   We find that the prosecution was not seeking to admit the 404(b) evidence to show a criminal disposition, but to provide evidence indicating that the shooting was not the shooting accident Scott claimed. Consequently, we find that Scott's argument that the trial court abused its discretion is without merit.     C.    Sufficiency of the Evidence              Finally, Scott argues that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and, therefore, the conviction should be overturned. Scott argues that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that “malice” existed -- an element required to be found before a jury can return a verdict of guilty for second degree murder. Scott contends that there was no evidence that he had ever met Brandon Rosenberger before the day of the shooting nor was there any evidence admitted tending to show that Scott acted with malice when he shot Brandon Rosenberger. Scott asserts that there was only one eyewitness to the fatal shooting, Scott himself, and he testified that the shooting was accidental.            We have established the following standards for reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge:             The function of an appellate court when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, is sufficient to convince a reasonable person of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.     Thus, the relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.              A criminal defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction takes on a heavy burden. An appellate court must review all the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and must credit all inferences and credibility assessments that the jury might have drawn in favor of the prosecution. The evidence need not be inconsistent with every conclusion save that of guilt so long as the jury can find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Credibility determinations are for a jury and not an appellate court. Finally, a jury verdict should be set aside only when the record contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To the extent that our prior cases are inconsistent, they are expressly overruled.    Syllabus Points 1 and 3,  State v. Guthrie , 194 W.Va. 657, 461 S.E.2d 163 (1995).            We have stated that a defendant faces an “uphill climb” when he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and that we will reverse “only if no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.”  State v. LaRock,  196 W.Va. 294, 303, 470 S.E.2d 613, 622 (1996).            The record in this matter indicates that Scott killed Brandon Rosenberger with a .22 caliber weapon from a distance of approximately 50 to 60 yards while Brandon was walking down a path. Scott argued that he was hunting. However, evidence was introduced that the shooting took place on a Sunday -- when it was illegal to hunt -- and in an area where it was illegal to hunt. Evidence was also introduced demonstrating that Scott had not hunted for a period of 1 to 2 years prior to the shooting, and did not have a hunting license.             In addition to this evidence, the jury also heard from neighbors and children who testified that Scott had a history of brandishing firearms in an attempt to intimidate people and keep individuals away from his property. Finally, the jury also heard testimony suggesting that not only did Scott leave Brandon Rosenberger after shooting him, but when Mr. Wheeler came to investigate the matter, Scott shot at him as well.             Taken in a light most favorable to the prosecutor, we believe that the evidence was sufficient to convince a reasonable person of Scott's malice in his actions toward Brandon Rosenberger. Consequently, we find that Scott's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support a guilty verdict for second degree murder is without merit.      III.                       In conclusion, we find that the trial court committed no error in regard to Scott's conviction and we therefore affirm the trial court.        Affirmed.         Footnote: 1          1 Scott also argues that the circuit court erred in permitting a jury view of the scene of the shooting during a time of year when the appearance of the scene was altered and by denying Scott's motion to suppress several statements made by Scott during the course of the investigation. We find these assignments of error to be without merit.          Footnote: 2          2 The “manner of death” refers to how the death occurred and the circumstances surrounding the decedent's death.           Footnote: 3          3 In  State v. Clark ,  supra. , we stated:              We agree that it was improper to permit the state medical examiner to testify conclusively that homicide was the manner of death. The appellant was charged with murder. In order for the jury to determine whether a murder had occurred, it first had to decide whether a homicide had taken place. Homicide means the killing of a human being by another human being for whatever reason justified or not. Once a jury determines that a homicide has occurred, it must then determine whether the killing was justified, and if not, the degree of culpability to be placed on the defendant.  Clark, 171 W.Va. at 78, 297 S.E.2d at 852-853.            Footnote: 4          4 In  Smith, supra,  we stated:           It is argued that the testimony of the medical examiner regarding the manner of death was impermissible under [ Clark ], insofar as it embraced an ultimate issue to be decided by the jury. However, in  Clark  we said that a medical examiner “may give his opinion as to the physical and medical cause of death.” 171 W.Va. at 78, 297 S.E.2d at 853. We indicated he could not invade the province of the jury by giving the ultimate fact     conclusion that it was a “homicide.” Since  Clark , we have adopted Rule 704 of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence . . .  178 W.Va. at 107 n.1, 358 S.E.2d at 191 n.1 (1987) (citations omitted).           Footnote: 5          5 Also, subsequent to the adoption of Rule 704 and  Clark , the state medical examiner has testified that homicide was the cause and manner of a victim's death.  See State v. Garrett , 195 W.Va. 630, 466 S.E.2d 481 (1995) and  State v. Triplett,  187 W.Va. 760, 421 S.E.2d 511 (1992).           Footnote: 6          6 We do not intimate that in some cases a defendant might be able to legitimately oppose permitting an expert to give an opinion that invades the province of the jury -- including labeling a death a “homicide.” This is not such a case.           Footnote: 7          7 W.Va. Code,  61-2-1 [1991] defines first and second degree murder as follows:           Murder by poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, or by any willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or in the commission of, or attempt to commit, arson, kidnaping, sexual assault, robbery, burglary, breaking and entering, escape from lawful custody, or a felony offense of manufacturing or delivering a controlled substance . . . is a murder of the first degree. All other murder is murder of the second degree.           Footnote: 8          8 ""This Court has always recognized that malice is an essential element to murder in the . . . second degree.”  State v. Starkey,  161 W.Va. 517, 523, 244 S.E.2d 219, 223, (1978) (citations omitted).           Footnote: 9          9     To prove malice in the instant case,     the prosecution relied upon the following 404(b) evidence: (1) Brian D., a child, testified that Scott had yelled at him, and had seen Scott holding a firearm on different occasions; (2) Christina D., a child, testified that she once had heard shots, after seeing Scott holding a handgun on his porch; (3) Nick D., a child, testified that after Scott's dog mysteriously disappeared, Scott had threatened Nick and his friend, saying that if Scott found out they had “messed” with his dogs he would kill them; (4) Josh C., a child, testified that while riding past Scott's trailer, Josh felt something hit his back -- and he believed that Scott had fired an air gun pellet at him; and (5) Fred Simmons, a neighbor, testified that Scott had mentioned he was going to shoot an acquaintance and, on another occasion, brandished a weapon while Scott made general threats toward those who “messed with him.”           Footnote: 10          10 The State offered the following reasons during the  McGinnis  hearing to explain the relevance of the requested testimony under 404(b):          [Scott] says it's an accident and that he did not intend, obviously, by saying that, did not intend to harm the victim or any person. We believe that by his pattern of making threats towards these youth that came through that area -- and Brandon Rosenberger [the victim], you'll hear later on in this hearing was     one of the individuals who was a recipient of threats and knew about the threats toward others, and all of these kids who we are talking about here today who were aware of how the defendant behaved toward them and was protective of his property and not wanting these youth up there.          Footnote: 11          11 The trial court did not permit all 404(b) evidence to be introduced at trial. The testimony of another child, Jeremy C., was rejected after the trial court determined that the testimony did not meet the requirements of  McGinnis.           Footnote: 12          12 W.Va. R. Evid.  Rule 403 provides:           Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by consideration of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.           Footnote: 13          13 In its order of April 27, 1998 the trial court stated that “the evidence is not unduly prejudicial and finds that there exist significant similarities between each incident and the State's theory of what occurred in this case and that the incidents are not too remote in time to be relevant.”"
GX066-00-7357053	"NEWS  RELEASE   For Immediate Distribution   ALEJANDRO N. MAYORKAS   United States Attorney  Central District of California       Thom Mrozek, Public Affairs Officer  (213) 894-6947  thom.mrozek@usdoj.gov       June 21, 1999     TWO MEN WHO SOLD COUNTERFEIT IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS  TO MORE THAN 1,100 VICTIMS SENTENCED TO 7+ AND 9 YEARS    The leaders of a conspiracy that produced and sold counterfeit immigration documents to hundreds of unsuspecting immigrants who were seeking legal residency in the United States have been sentenced to substantial prison terms for defrauding approximately $11 million from their victims, United States Attorney Alejandro N. Mayorkas announced today.   Working with a counterfeited “I-551 stamp” -- essentially a temporary proof of legal residency or “green card” that is stamped into a passport -- the immigration fraud ring operated out of a number of offices in the Los Angeles area and was able to charge customers up to $10,000 for what they thought was a legitimate and legal immigration procedure.   In early 1995, Jose Mendoza De La Merced and Don Thomas Banzon joined together to form an immigration business that operated under names such as Merced & Associates; Law Offices of Wang, Lee & Associates; and Law Offices of Eaton & Friedman. Individual victims heard, through word of mouth or a series of recruiters, that they could obtain valid immigration documents from Merced, whom many believed to be a lawyer, and/or his partner.   Banzon, 47, of Los Angeles, was sentenced today to 87 months in federal prison. Merced, 44, of La Habra, was sentenced last week to 108 months incarceration. Both defendants pleaded guilty in November to smuggling, making false statements to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, counterfeiting INS documents, mail fraud and money laundering. The court determined that both defendants laundered more than $1 million, which made them eligible for enhanced sentences under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.   Both defendants were sentenced by United States District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, who ordered both men to pay restitution of $1,061,638.75.   Merced received a longer sentence than Banzon because Judge Wilson found that he obstructed justice by destroying evidence.   “These defendants targeted a vulnerable immigrant community, and they deserve the severe punishment they received,” said United States Attorney Mayorkas. “This office is committed to protecting the rights of each and every resident of this country, particularly those who may fear reporting crimes to authorities.”   Thomas J. Schiltgen, District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, stated: “This investigation marks the intensified efforts of the INS to combat these fraud practitioners who persist to exploit undocumented migrants. We will continue to aggressively pursue these lawbreakers in accordance with the Attorney General's initiative established to rid our communities of these types of unscrupulous immigration fraud practitioners.”   John G. Freeman, Inspector in Charge of the United States Postal Inspection Service, Southern California Division, said: “Although mail fraud schemes perpetrated against anyone are intolerable, the financial hardship and devastation caused in this case which targeted immigrants is particularly shocking. Use of the U.S. Mails to steal money from any unsuspecting victims could trigger an investigation by Postal Inspectors and could result in felony convictions and stiff prison sentences for mail fraud and other crimes, as evidenced here.”   This case involves a total of 10 defendants. Two other men were previously sentenced by Judge Wilson to prison terms of 30 months each. Five other defendants in the case have been convicted and will be sentenced throughout the summer. One defendant is a fugitive who is wanted by federal authorities.   Merced and Banzon orchestrated the sophisticated scheme in which many victims were told that they were able to obtain legal status through a new law enacted by President Clinton called ""245.10."" (While there is a law 245.10, it did not apply to any of the victims in this case.) The fraud ring filed political asylum applications on behalf of clients, which prompted the Immigration and Naturalization Service to open files on behalf of the victims. However, the victims were never told about the asylum process, specifically that they had to appear before the INS to discuss their cases. When the ring was shut down in January 1997 after 2½ years of operation, hundreds of notices from the INS were found.   As part of the scheme, Merced, Banzon, or one of their associates would accompany victims to the INS office in downtown Los Angeles. The victims were often told that they were going to INS to get “adjusted.” At the INS offices, an I-485 Application (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) was completed with the required fee of $130.00 for the application. After paying the fee and submitting the residency form to INS, many victims were told they had been “adjusted.” In fact, the trip to INS was simply part of the scheme to lull the victims into believing that they were legitimately going through an immigration process. The I-485 form, while paid for at INS in the presence of the victim, was never actually filed with INS.   After completing the sham visit to INS, the victims gave up their passports after being told they would receive their passports with the I-551 stamp in a few weeks. Sometime later, the passport was returned with a counterfeit I-551 stamp.   During the investigation, bank account records showed that some of the victims' money was placed in bank accounts and that the money was used to pay for rent in high-rise office buildings, cell phones, luxury automobiles, insurance on automobiles and employee payroll.    Release No. 99-124                Return to the  Home Page"

The four defendants are scheduled for trial July 29 in Valencia County Court.     The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Attorney General Jody Curran.   Estevan Apodaca, who pled guilty to two felony    counts for violations of the Pyramid Promotional Schemes Act, was recently given    45 days by district court to return $30,000 in restitution before returning    to court for final sentencing, which could include time in jail.   ####"

CHICAGO, IL 60604  NEWS RELEASE Monday, July 29, 2002  Mexican National Sentenced for Identity Document Fraud Chicago, IL - Brian R. Perryman, District Director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in Chicago, together with Patrick J. Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, announced the sentencing of a Mexican national for operating a document fraud ring in the city of West Chicago. Gerardo Garcia-Juarez, age 31, an undocumented alien from Mexico residing at 646 South Neltnor in West Chicago, was sentenced July 26 by U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. Gettleman to 21 months in prison. Garcia-Juarez, a taxicab owner/operator, would take orders for counterfeit identity documents from his taxi and then return to his apartment on South Neltnor to produce the documents. Once the documents were manufactured, Garcia-Juarez would set up a meeting with his clients to deliver the order for a fee of $150.00. The arrest of Garcia-Juarez was the result of a joint investigation conducted by the INS and the West Chicago Police Department that began in October 2001. During the course of the investigation, which culminated in the service of a search warrant at Garcia-Juarez's residence February 12, 2002, INS agents seized 241 counterfeit social security cards and green cards. Garcia-Juarez was making these documents and selling them for $150 a set to undocumented aliens. Counterfeit documents sell on the street in the Chicago area for between $100 to $150 per set, which includes a false social security card and green card, and are routinely manufactured and sold to undocumented aliens who purchase such documents to obtain employment. Since 1998, documents surrendered deportation INS agents in Chicago have confiscated more than 70,000 fraudulent from illegal document manufacturers and vendors. Garcia-Juarez will be to the custody of INS upon completion of his sentence to be placed in proceedings. ###

Wayne Fountain,  Special Judge  Cause No. 79D02-0112-CF-148            May 15, 2003     OPINION – FOR PUBLICATION      BAILEY, Judge          Case Summary        Christopher Sipple (Sipple) appeals the maximum eight-year sentence he received after pleading guilty  to Involuntary Manslaughter.        See footnote    We affirm.             Issue        The issue here is whether the trial court properly sentenced Sipple to the  maximum eight years for his crime.      Facts and Procedural History        Shortly after midnight on January 24, 2001, members of the Tippecanoe County Sheriff’s  Department arrived at Sipple’s parents’ residence in response to a call regarding a  shooting.  They found Sipple’s pregnant twenty-one-year-old wife Christina on the floor near  the doorway between the bedroom and living area of the basement suite in  which the couple lived.  Her feet were apparently in the living area,  and her head was in the bedroom.  Sipple and his father Wes  were standing by Christina, who had a gunshot wound to her abdomen.   Police officers did not observe any blood around the room other than that  which was coming from Christina’s wound.  The officers found a loaded shotgun  on the bed inside the bedroom.  Paramedics soon arrived, but Christina was  pronounced dead shortly thereafter.        Sipple was taken by police officers to a police vehicle and was questioned  about the incident.  After speaking with officers in the vehicle, Sipple was  taken to the police station where he provided additional details about the shooting.   Both conversations were recorded.  Sipple stated that he and a friend  began hunting coyotes behind the residence that Sipple and Christina shared with Sipple’s  parents at some point before 11:00 p.m.  The pair hunted for around  twenty minutes, and then returned to the residence.  The two men and  their wives played cards in the living area of the basement until around  11:30 p.m., when Sipple’s hunting partner and his wife left.  Sipple and  Christina went to bed.  At some point, Sipple walked upstairs from the  basement to use the restroom.  The lights in the basement were off,  and the area was dark.  Despite the darkness, Sipple noticed as he  came back down the stairs that he had left the 12-guage shotgun used  on the coyote hunt against or near the wall next to the bedroom  door.  Sipple stated that he realized he had forgotten to unload the  weapon, so he evidently decided to bring it into the lightless bedroom where  his wife was sleeping to remove the shells from the gun.  He  stated that he was carrying the gun with his left hand on or  near the fore-stock pump mechanism, his right hand on the hand-grip area of  the stock near the trigger and the barrel up and across his body  to the left in a port arms position.  Sipple was adamant that  his right index finger was not inside the trigger guard.  Sipple told  the officers that as he was walking with the loaded shotgun in the  darkness toward the doorway to the bedroom, he tripped over a piece of  furniture and fell to the ground while still holding the weapon.  According  to Sipple, his finger was not on the trigger, and the gun’s safety  was on.  Sipple fell on top of the weapon and it discharged  a single shot in the direction of the doorway.  Sipple heard a  scream, looked up from the floor, and even though it was too dark  to see the piece of furniture on which he tripped, he was able  to see his wife lying on the ground with a wound to her  abdomen.  He then turned on the lights to the bedroom and threw  his gun on the bed.  His parents came down the stairs to  the basement and turned on the lights to the living area.  Sipple  said that his parents handed him a towel that he used to slow  the bleeding from Christina’s wound until the ambulance arrived.        In the early morning hours of January 25, 2001, Dr. Donna Smith performed  an autopsy on Christina.  The autopsy indicated that Christina had been struck  by a shotgun blast coming from above her head rather than from below  her waist, as Sipple’s version of events suggested.  The muzzle of the  gun was between three and six feet from Christina at the time of  the shooting.    Police officers returned to Sipple’s residence after the autopsy to look for any  evidence of splattered blood consistent with the kind of wound Christina sustained.   They found none.  The officers also took various measurements of the basement  and of Sipple’s gun.  Taking these measurements, as well as information obtained  during the autopsy regarding the path of the shotgun blast and the distance  between the muzzle of the gun and Christina’s body, police officers concluded that  Christina was most likely shot while lying on the ground by someone standing  above her head and behind her.        Police officers spoke with Sipple again during the afternoon of January 25, 2001  to discuss the discrepancies between his story and the pathology evidence.  As  before, Sipple stated that he was walking with the gun, but this time  told the officers that his right index finger was inside the trigger guard.   He repeated his claim that he tripped over a piece of furniture  on the way to the bedroom, but now said that the gun went  off as he tripped, and that he fell over after the shot was  fired.  He heard his wife say that she couldn’t move, so he  turned on the lights in the bedroom and saw his wife on the  ground in the doorway.  Sipple did not explain how he was able  to step over his wife’s body without tripping over her in the total  darkness to get into the bedroom to turn the lights on.        On January 26, 2001, police officers returned to the residence with a search  warrant, and performed testing to reveal the presence of blood evidence in the  basement.  They found evidence of blood on the wall of the bedroom  near where Christina’s body was found, as well evidence of blood on a  nearby CD rack.  Blood on both areas appeared to have been wiped  off.  In addition, the testing indicated that some amount of blood had  been wiped from the carpet before paramedics arrived.  Members of the Sipple  family denied cleaning the area.        On January 29, 2001, Sipple gave yet another statement to the police in  which he changed key points of his story.  Sipple again said that  he came down the stairs to the pitch-black basement after visiting the restroom  and somehow sensed the presence of his loaded shotgun leaning against the wall.   He picked up the weapon and proceeded toward the equally darkened bedroom  to unload it when he bumped into his wife as she was walking  out through the doorway.  According to Sipple, he knocked Christina down.   Sipple generally stated that he was carrying his gun as described above, with  the fore-stock in his left hand, his right hand on the stock near  the trigger, and the barrel generally pointed ahead.  This time, however, Sipple  stated that the barrel of the gun was pointed down rather than up.   Sipple claimed that he felt his wife startle as he ran into  her.  He did not explain how his body contacted his wife before  the protruding barrel of the shotgun did.  After knocking his wife to  the ground, Sipple evidently continued through the doorway in complete darkness, stepping over  but not on his wife’s prone body.  He then turned around, swinging  the barrel of the downward-pointed shotgun in his wife’s direction.  Just as  the barrel of the gun was centered on Christina’s abdomen, it mysteriously discharged.   Sipple, who never brought loaded guns into his house and who always  used a gun’s safety trigger lock, did not explain how the weapon fired.   He denied seeing blood on the wall and CD rack, the existence  of which had been revealed in testing done on January 26, and denied  cleaning up any blood.         On November 28, 2001, the State charged Sipple with Reckless Homicide, Criminal Recklessness,  and Involuntary Manslaughter, each as a Class C felony.  Sipple eventually pleaded  guilty to Involuntary Manslaughter.  During the September 27, 2002 hearing on his  guilty plea, Sipple abandoned the story he had told on January 29, 2002,  reverting instead to a form of the version of events related to police  in his earlier statements.  He testified that the shotgun went off after  he tripped on a small piece of furniture on his way into the  bedroom.  The State did not object to Sipple’s testimony, and made no  effort to rescind the plea agreement and charge Sipple with a more serious  crime on the basis of the discrepancies between the evidence and Sipple’s constantly  changing stories.  He related this version of events during the November 13, 2002 sentencing hearing.   During the hearing, Sipple added that he began to fall to the  ground after tripping over the furniture.  Rather than dropping the weapon, which  was pointed off to his left, to catch himself as he fell, however,  Sipple swung the gun around to the darkened doorway in mid-fall and inexplicably  pulled the trigger, shooting his wife.      At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed the maximum  eight-year sentence for Sipple’s Class C felony conviction.  In support of the  enhancement, the trial court noted that it had received numerous letters from Christina’s  family and friends demanding that Sipple receive the maximum possible sentence for taking  the lives of Christina and her unborn child.  The trial court found  the killing’s psychological impact on Christina’s family and friends supported the maximum enhancement.   The trial court also found Sipple’s lack of remorse over Christina’s death,  as discussed by several of the letter writers and by those who testified  during the hearing, warranted enhancement.  The court further considered what it saw  as Sipple’s efforts to conceal the truth about the shooting to be aggravating.   Finally, the trial court found that the maximum enhancement was justified by  the facts and circumstances of the case, which in the view of the  court amounted to a degree of recklessness beyond that normally associated with the  crime for which Sipple was being sentenced.  The only mitigator Sipple proffered  was his clean criminal record.  The trial court declined, however, to ascribe  much significance to this fact, and determined that it did not outweigh the  aggravators.      Sipple appeals.      Discussion and Decision  A.  Standard of Review    Determining the appropriate sentence is within the trial court’s discretion, and the trial  court will only be reversed if it has abused that discretion.  Bacher  v. State, 722 N.E.2d 799, 801 (Ind. 2000).  The trial court has  the discretion to increase or decrease a presumptive sentence upon finding aggravating or  mitigating circumstances. Id.  The weighing of those factors is soundly within the  court’s discretion.  Id.  When the court imposes a sentence other than the presumptive sentence, we examine  the record to determine whether the trial court sufficiently explained its reasons for  selecting the sentence it imposed.  Kile v. State, 729 N.E.2d 211, 213  (Ind. Ct. App. 2000).  The trial court must identify all significant aggravating  and mitigating circumstances, explain why each circumstance is aggravating or mitigating, and weigh  mitigating circumstances against the aggravating factors.  Utley v. State, 699 N.E.2d 723,  730 (Ind. Ct. App. 1998).  While a sentencing court must consider all  evidence of mitigating circumstances presented by a defendant, the finding of mitigating circumstances  rests within the sound discretion of the court.  Bacher, 722 N.E.2d at  803.  The court cannot ignore mitigating factors that are clearly supported by  the record.  Widener v. State, 659 N.E.2d 529, 534 (Ind. 1995).   The failure to find a mitigating circumstance clearly supported by the record may  imply that the circumstance in question was overlooked.  Id.  However, the  trial court need not consider, and we will not remand for reconsideration of,  alleged mitigating factors that are highly disputable in nature, weight, or significance.   Wilkins v. State, 500 N.E.2d 747, 749 (Ind. 1986).  Moreover, a sentencing  court need not agree with the defendant as to the weight or value  to be given to proffered mitigating facts.  Bacher, 722 N.E.2d at 803.   Indeed, a sentencing court is under no obligation to find mitigating factors  at all.  Echols v. State, 722 N.E.2d 805, 808 (Ind. 2000).   Ultimately, a single aggravator may support the enhancement of a sentence, and we  may affirm an enhanced sentence when a trial court has relied in part  upon improper aggravators so long as the trial court relied on other proper  aggravators to enhance the sentence.  Hollen v. State, 761 N.E.2d 398, 402  (Ind. 2002).   B.  Analysis  1.  Sentence Enhancement        Sipple’s conviction for Involuntary Manslaughter as a Class C felony came with a  presumptive sentence of four years, to which up to four years could be  added for aggravating circumstances, and as many as two years subtracted for mitigating  circumstances.  See Ind. Code § 35-50-2-6(a).  The trial court, as noted  above, enhanced Sipple’s four-year presumptive sentence by the maximum four years.  Sipple  contends that his sentence is improper because it was enhanced on the basis  of invalid aggravators and did not account for significant mitigators.  Specifically, Sipple  claims that the trial court erroneously identified the wishes of Christina’s family and  friends, Sipple’s efforts to conceal the truth about the shooting, and the nature  and circumstances of the recklessness involved here.  Sipple does not challenge the  trial court’s use of his lack of remorse as an aggravator.  Sipple  also argues that his lack of criminal history and his guilty plea should  have been considered and given weight as mitigators.     a.  Aggravators  (1)  Victim Impact        Sipple correctly notes that the loss that accompanies a person’s death and its  impact on the person’s family and friends is largely encompassed within the range  of impact which the presumptive sentence for Involuntary Manslaughter is designed to punish,  and should therefore generally not be considered a factor favoring the imposition of  an enhanced sentence.  See Pickens v. State, 767 N.E.2d 530, 535 (Ind.  2002) (noting that impact of loss of murder victim’s life is part of  what presumptive sentence for murder punishes).  The impact resulting from a person’s  death may, however, constitute a proper aggravator when the defendant’s actions foreseeably caused  a level of devastation not typically associated with the commission of the offense  in question.  Id.  The trial court found that the impact of  Christina’s death on her family was unusually severe because they lost not only  Christina, but also her unborn child.  The loss of Christina’s unborn child  to her family constituted an impact of a destructive nature not typically associated  with the crime of Involuntary Manslaughter.  Given that Sipple was well aware  of his wife’s pregnancy, this impact was not unforeseeable.  The trial court  was therefore entitled to conclude that the impact on Christina’s family was a  factor justifying an enhanced sentence.   (2)  Concealment of Truth        Sipple also complains that the trial court’s reliance upon what the court viewed  as Sipple’s efforts to conceal the truth about the shooting was improper.   As Sipple sees it, when the trial court noted that Sipple had changed  his story numerous times, the trial court was engaged in an effort to  compensate for what the court felt was a plea deal too favorable to  Sipple.  In light of the fact that the evidence here arguably supported  a murder charge, Sipple’s concerns are understandable.  Indeed, some of those who  wrote to the trial court judge urging the imposition of the maximum sentence  suggested that Sipple intentionally killed his wife after taking up with another woman.   The State did not, however, charge Sipple with murder, and it would  have been entirely improper for the sentencing court here to have enhanced Sipple’s  sentence out of the belief that Sipple could have been charged or convicted  of a greater crime, or that he was allowed to plead guilty to  a lesser offense than the evidence might have supported.  See Cloum v.  State, 779 N.E.2d 84, 92 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002) (instructing trial court upon  remand to refrain from enhancing presumptive sentence for voluntary manslaughter conviction obtained after  guilty plea, when defendant initially charged with murder).    We do not think, however, that the trial court’s recognition that Sipple’s story  had been a work in progress revealed an improper intent to impose extra  punishment.  As noted in Cloum, the Indiana Supreme Court concluded in Gambill  that the trial court improperly enhanced a sentence for voluntary manslaughter to compensate  for what the trial court felt should have been a sentence for murder  when the judge explicitly said that he thought that voluntary manslaughter was not  the right verdict and that the evidence justified a murder conviction.  779  N.E.2d at 92 (citing Gambill, 436 N.E.2d at 305).  In Cloum, however,  we also noted that our supreme court found in another case that the  trial court’s statement attributing the defendant’s conviction of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder  to the skill of the defendant’s lawyer in establishing the element of sudden  heat in the face of conflicting evidence was “not a statement ‘so resolutely  opposed to the jury verdict as was the case in Gambill,’” and that  the resulting sentence for voluntary manslaughter in Cloum was therefore “not suspect.”   Id. at 91 (quoting Wilson v. State, 458 N.E.2d 654, 656 (Ind. 1984)).     In this case, the trial court did not state that Sipple should have  been charged with a greater offense than Involuntary Manslaughter or either of the  other two Class C felonies with which he was charged, or that Sipple  could have been convicted of a greater offense.  There is simply nothing  in the record to suggest that the trial court attempted to compensate for  charges not brought or convictions not obtained.  The trial court only noted  that Sipple’s story was inconsistent, and stated that the court found this conduct  troubling.  As the State notes, Sipple’s disinclination to provide an accurate account  of the events leading up to the shooting goes to his character, a  factor the trial court was required to consider during sentencing.  See Ind.  Code § 35-38-1-7.1(a)(3)(B).  Moreover, a trial court may consider a defendant’s effort  to interfere in the investigation of a crime by concealing information to be  an aggravating circumstance.  See Kingery v. State, 659 N.E.2d 490, 498 (Ind.  1995).  The trial court was entitled to conclude that Sipple attempted to  mislead the police in their investigation of the shooting by relating various inconsistent  stories, and to find this circumstance aggravating.   (3)  Degree of Recklessness        Sipple next argues that the trial court should not have enhanced his sentence  on the basis of its conclusion that the crime was committed with an  unusually high degree of   recklessness, because recklessness was a material element of Sipple’s crime.        See footnote    A material  element of a crime may not also constitute an aggravating circumstance.        Ellis  v. State, 707 N.E.2d 797, 804 (Ind. 1999).  The trial court may,  however, enhance a sentence on the basis of the particularized circumstances of the  criminal act so long as the court explains why those circumstances warrant the  enhancement.  Id.        As noted above, the evidence in this case indicated that Sipple picked up  a loaded shotgun in a completely dark room and, without turning on the  lights, walked through the darkness with his hand on or near the trigger,  the safety evidently off, and the barrel pointed ahead with the intention of  unloading the weapon in the darkened bedroom where his pregnant wife was sleeping.   The court explained its reliance on these facts as follows:        Again, in the sentencing statutes although the charge[d] crime is one of recklessness,  the Court can in certain circumstances look at the facts and circumstances surrounding  the recklessness and I do find the degree of recklessness in this case  to carry a loaded weapon with the safety not on through a dark  room knowing that there are people present in that room is far beyond  the normal amount of recklessness that the court can accept in a case  like this.            (Tr. 64.)  The trial court’s explanation was significantly more than the mere  recitation of the elements of the offense, and adequately supported the finding of  this aggravating circumstance.     b.  Mitigators  (1)  Lack of Criminal History        Sipple also argues that the trial court failed to properly consider his clean  criminal record as a mitigator.  A trial court must consider a defendant’s  criminal record during sentencing, Ind. Code § 35-38-1-7.1(a)(3)(C), and may take the defendant’s  lack of a history of criminal activity into account as a mitigating circumstance.   Id. at § -7.1(c)(6).  Here, the trial court recognized that Sipple  had no prior criminal record, but declined to ascribe this fact any mitigating  weight.  “In a criminal justice system founded on the principles of reformation,  see Ind. Const. art. I, § 18, where reasonably possible, sentencing orders should  distinguish between first offenders and repeat offenders.”  Bluck v. State, 716 N.E.2d  507, 514 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999).  Thus, the absence of a criminal  record is usually a factor entitled to “substantial mitigating weight.”  See Loveless  v. State, 642 N.E.2d 974, 976 (Ind. 1994).    Nevertheless, as noted above, the sentencing court need not agree with the defendant  as to the weight or value to be given to proffered mitigating facts,  Bacher, 722 N.E.2d at 803, and ultimately is not obligated to find mitigating  factors at all, Echols, 722 N.E.2d at 808.  A trial court may  properly conclude that a defendant’s lack of a criminal record is not entitled  to mitigating weight.  Jones v. State, 467 N.E.2d 681, 684 (Ind. 1984).   The trial court considered Sipple’s clean criminal record but declined to find  it mitigating under the circumstances.  This determination was within the court’s discretion.   (2)  Guilty Plea        Sipple additionally contends that the trial court erred by failing to conclude that  his guilty plea was a significant mitigating factor.  Sipple did not argue  during sentencing that his guilty plea should be considered, and the trial court  did not specifically mention the plea during the hearing.  Nevertheless, as noted  above, the sentencing court may not ignore significant mitigating factors that are clearly  supported by the record, and the court’s failure to find a clearly supported  mitigating circumstance may imply that the circumstance in question was overlooked.  Widener  v. State, 659 N.E.2d 529, 534 (Ind. 1995).  Thus, to support his  allegation that the trial court improperly failed to properly consider his guilty plea,  Sipple was required to establish that the guilty plea was both significant and  clearly supported by the record.  Antrim v. State, 745 N.E.2d 246, 248  (Ind. Ct. App. 2001).  The plea was not a significant mitigator.      “[N]ot every plea of guilty is a significant mitigating circumstance that must be  credited by a trial court.”  Trueblood v. State, 715 N.E.2d 1242, 1257  (Ind.  1999).  But when a guilty plea “saves the State the  time and expense inherent in a lengthy trial” and  “accordingly extends a  benefit to the State and the victim's family by avoiding a full-blown trial,  as well as demonstrating the defendant's acceptance of responsibility for a crime,” the  plea should be accorded significant mitigating weight.  Id.  In this case,  while Sipple’s plea saved the State the expense and time of a trial,  the benefit to the State was moderate at best given the fact that  Sipple had already given several statements to the police in which Sipple admitted  facts that, at a minimum, established his guilt of the crime to which  he pleaded.  Indeed, there was nothing in Sipple’s testimony given during the  hearing on his guilty plea that had not come out in one or  more of his earlier statements to the police.  Moreover, in light of  the position Christine’s family took with regard to Sipple’s sentencing and their evident  desire to see Sipple prosecuted to the maximum extent possible, the avoidance of  further family trauma does not weigh heavily in favor of the mitigating effect  of Sipple’s guilty plea.  Finally, Sipple’s story to the police conflicted with  forensic evidence and changed in important respects each time he gave a statement.   The story changed again between the time he agreed to plead guilty  and the date of the hearing on his plea.  Sipple’s plea therefore  hardly indicates his acceptance of responsibility for the crime.  In sum, Sipple  failed to establish that his guilty plea was a significant mitigating circumstance, and  we cannot say that the trial court erred by declining to identify it  as such.   c.  Balancing        The trial court found the wishes of Christina’s family and friends, Sipple’s efforts  to conceal the truth about the shooting, the nature and circumstances of the  recklessness involved here, and Sipple’s lack of remorse as factors favoring the imposition  of an enhanced sentence.  The trial court’s findings with regard to the  first three factors were not inappropriate, and Sipple does not challenge the court’s  use of his lack of remorse to support the enhancement.  Moreover, the  trial court did not err by declining to find Sipple’s guilty plea and  his lack of a criminal record mitigating.  The enhancement of Sipple’s sentence  was accordingly within the trial court’s discretion.   2.  Sentence Revision          Pursuant to the authority granted by Article Seven, section six of the Indiana  Constitution, Appellate Rule 7(b) provides that a reviewing court “may revise a sentence  authorized by statute if, after due consideration of the trial court’s decision, the  Court finds that the sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of  the offense and the character of the offender.  In general, the maximum  possible sentences should be reserved for the worst offenders and offenses.  See  Buchanan v. State, 767 N.E.2d 967, 974 (Ind. 2002).  Sipple contends that  the maximum enhancement of his sentence was inappropriate and should therefore be revised  because he was not the worst offender and did not commit the worst  of offenses.    In Buchanan, our supreme court attempted to clarify the rule regarding the imposition  of maximum sentences as follows:  This is not, however, a guideline to determine whether a worse offender could  be imagined.  Despite the nature of any particular offense and offender, it  will always be possible to identify or hypothesize a significantly more despicable scenario.   Although maximum sentences are ordinarily appropriate for the worst offenders, we refer  generally to the class of offenses and offenders that warrant the maximum punishment.   But such class encompasses a considerable variety of offenses and offenders.          767 N.E.2d 974 (emphasis in original).  In this case, Sipple pleaded guilty  to and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.  Our discussion above relating to  the propriety of the trial court’s identification of the degree of recklessness with  which Sipple committed this crime leads us to conclude that Sipple was among  the worst involuntary manslaughter offenders and his crime was among the worst within  that class of offenses.  Again, Sipple picked up a loaded shotgun in  a completely dark room and, without turning on the lights, walked through the  darkness with his hand on or near the trigger, the safety evidently off,  and the barrel pointed ahead with the intention of unloading the weapon (which  was done by discharging it) in the darkened bedroom where his pregnant wife  was sleeping.  In the process, Sipple killed his wife and their unborn  child.  Sipple does not suggest how this scenario could have been more  egregious and yet remain involuntary manslaughter and not a more serious offense.   The maximum enhancement of Sipple’s sentence was not inappropriate.      Affirmed.   BROOK, C.J., and NAJAM, J., concur.                Footnote:           I      nd. Code § 35-42-1-4.   Footnote:           Recklessness was a material element of Involuntary Manslaughter here.

Insurance                                          Fraud Prosecutor Greta Gooden Brown noted                                          that on the street, phony insurance identification                                          cards can be valuable, selling for $50                                          to more than $200 each. They have value                                          because they enable persons to drive without                                          buying a legitimate automobile insurance                                          policy.

Carter.   In September 2002, Reynolds pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to produce and use counterfeit credit cards. Reynolds and others at his direction would obtain identifying information and credit card account numbers from a variety of sources, including by using a hand-held ""skimmer"" device to capture the credit card account information from unsuspecting consumers at the TGI Friday’s restaurant in Laguna Niguel. Reynolds would then manufacture counterfeit credit cards with the stolen account numbers, and he would make purchases in California and Arizona with the bogus cards.   At the time of his arrest in May 2002, Reynolds had approximately 85 counterfeit credit cards, 13 counterfeit California Driver's Licenses, 278 credit card account numbers and other identifying information of persons other than himself, and devices used to make counterfeit cards. The total estimated loss from Reynolds' conduct is $229,835.   This case is the product of an investigation by the United States Secret Service.   Robert Brenner, Resident Agent in Charge of the Santa Ana Office of the United States Secret Service, stated: ""The ultimate goal of the Secret Service in the investigation of all financial crimes is to suppress the perpetration of offenses against the public. Through this investigation and the successful prosecution of Reynolds, we were able to serve that goal.""   Release No. 03-034    Return to the   2003 Press Release Index.   Return to the  Home Page"

SHEEHY and EFRAIN A. ROSARIO            T he    trail of drug paraphernalia can lead investigators to illicit drugs and drug    gangs.   The    FBI in Baltimore, Maryland, together with the Maryland State Police, U.S. Customs    Service, DEA, Internal Revenue Service, Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and    Howard County Police Departments put this concept to the test. From April 1997    through February 2000, these agencies conducted an investigation targeting drug    paraphernalia outlets. Known as “Shop Light,” this investigation used    the   outlets    as a means to locate, identify, and disrupt (or dismantle) large drug organizations    operating in the greater Baltimore metropolitan area.            The    Shop Light investigation recognized that two types of illegal paraphernalia    stores operated in the region. However, the investigation ignored the first    type of store, commonly referred to as “head shops,” because their    inventory, although illegal, consists of products designed for the end user    (addicts) to ingest drugs. Instead, the investigation   focused    on the second type of store, typically known as “cut or vial stores.”    Their inventory includes diluents, adulterants, and other products used by drug    organizations to measure, separate, convert, dilute, adulterate, and package    drugs in bulk quantities that drug gangs then sell.            UNDERSTANDING    THE CONNECTION            In    April 1997, investigators found 30 businesses in the city of Baltimore engaged    in the sale of  drug    paraphernalia to area gangs. With the exception of just a few of the businesses,    the sale of paraphernalia accounted for nearly all of the revenue received by    the shops. A review of law enforcement records revealed that police already    knew about the stores and, in fact, had raided most of the stores, some on more    than one occasion. Nearly all of the prior raids failed to result in meaningful    prosecutions, with most of these cases being stetted or nolle prossed. Those    that authorities pursued resulted in a fine and probation before judgment. The    subjects considered the prosecution merely an inconvenience and simply the price    of doing business. Further investigation discovered that even those offenders    successfully prosecuted in the past immediately reopened their stores and continued    business as usual. Two central themes appeared in the ill-fated cases: first,    an apparent lack of understanding of the essential and contributory role played    by these stores in the distribution of drugs and, second, an   inability    to present adequate testimony of the illegal nature and use of the paraphernalia.             Investigators    should not consider paraphernalia stores as an isolated industry, separate and    distinct from drug gangs. In fact, these stores fill an absolutely essential    role with each drug gang that patronizes such a store. For example, a kilogram    of raw heroin, purchased in New York for distribution in Bal-timore, is essentially    worth little more than its cost upon arrival at Baltimore in its raw form. However,    when diluted (gangs in Balti-more favored mannitol and quinine), the drug gang    will realize an increase in weight to approximately 8 kilograms of heroin at    a 13 percent purity level, ready for packaging and sale. At a very minimum,    the gang will gross a sixfold return over the cost of the original kilogram.             In    short, the paraphernalia industry acts in concert with the drug gangs, facilitating    drug distribution by supplying the means to   accomplish    the cutting and packaging of illegal drugs. This fact is exploited by the shops,    which greedily share in the drug proceeds by charging extraordinary mark ups,    ranging up to 2,500 percent over the cost of items sold. Evidence from cooperating    subjects revealed that shop owners also would advance paraphernalia to their    larger drug customers and await payment until after the drugs were sold.             Based    upon this view, one objective in the Shop Light investigation was to seriously    impact the paraphernalia industry after first using the industry to eliminate    multiple drug gangs. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Mary-land    decided to charge the more significant paraphernalia subjects with Conspiracy    to Aid and Abet the Distribution of Drugs and Engaging in Continuing Criminal    Enterprise (CCE) as more reflective of their involvement than mere violation    of paraphernalia laws. This case marked the first use of the CCE statute when    the underlying violation involved paraphernalia.       STRUCTURING    THE INVESTIGATION            Initially,    investigators must determine what diluents/adulterants (cut) and packaging materials    drug gangs operating in their territory favor. Debriefing such individuals as    drug subjects, sources, and local police officers should provide locations of    cut and vial stores from which drug organizations secure their supplies. Another    source of information concerning the whereabouts of these stores includes the    manufacturers of some of the items, such as gelatin capsules.            Once    investigators locate the stores, they should have sources or undercover officers    make small purchases of drug paraphernalia to observe the outlets’ operations.    After analyzing the information obtained during debriefings, investigators then    can formulate an investigative strategy. Next, investigators need to answer    some important questions.       cooperation.    Passive (covert) use of the stores occurs when investigators establish surveillance    without the knowledge of store owners/managers. And, of course, investigators    may choose to approach some store owners, securing their cooperation, while    conducting surveillance at other stores without involving the owners/managers.      •      How many outlets are operating in the area and when are they open?     •    Can    investigators identify the largest outlets and does paraphernalia sales account    for the majority of their business?     •    Should    authorities put some of the smaller outlets and those where legitimate business    is greater than paraphernalia sales out of the “cut game?” Continuous    raids that seize the products each time the store restocks paraphernalia will    force it to discontinue the sale of those items.     •    Which    stores are located in areas that investigators can surveil, including the use    of closed-circuit television under certain conditions?                   If    the answers to these questions reveal that cut/vial shops are in operation,    the most important question for investigators then becomes the selection of    an approach. The conduct of the investigation can be overt, covert, or both.    That is, aggressive (overt) use of the shops involves approaching the store    owners and securing their  cooperation. Passive (covert) use of the stores    occurs when investigators    establish surveillance without the knowledge of store owners/managers. And,    of course, investigators may choose to approach some store owners, securing    their cooperation, while conducting surveillance at other stores without involving    the owners/managers.          The    Shop Light investigation obtained positive results using both overt and covert    approaches. Obviously, cooperation from the store owner/manager simplifies selection    of which drug gangs to investigate. Owners can rank their customers based upon    the quantities of cut and packaging purchased, as well as the frequency at which    they make purchases. If owners do not know the true names of customers, they    often know their street names and usually can supply pager numbers, as well    as vehicle descriptions. If a gang frequents a store, the owner may restrict    certain products for its use alone, such as a specific color of gelatin capsule    or small plastic resealable bags bearing a specific stamp. By offering special    pricing discounts or restricted packaging, a   cooperating    store owner may predict the arrival of certain drug subjects, thereby making    surveillance more productive.            Regardless    of the approach, the objective remains the same, to follow drug dealers to their    “safe” or “stash” houses where they store drugs, weapons,    cash, documents, and other items of value to the investigation. The most compelling    reason for monitoring paraphernalia stores is that the drug dealers themselves    are indicating a recent receipt of raw drugs by making purchases of paraphernalia.    Following the paraphernalia will lead investigators directly to the nerve center    of the gang. Experience gained in Shop Light determined that drug gangs do not    stockpile or keep inventories of diluents and packaging, rather they purchase    those items on an as-needed basis. Investigators found that this paraphernalia    resupply, on average, occurred on a 2-week cycle, timed with the purchase of    raw drugs.       Overt    Approach: Owner Cooperates            Investigators    can obtain the cooperation of some store owners for economic reasons. Some will    prefer to assist investigators as a means to continue reaping the profits from    their business, rather than face closure, loss of income, and criminal charges.    However, absent prior contact indicating that a paraphernalia shop owner will    cooperate, investigators first should make a case against the store before “quietly”    approaching the owner away from the business. Indeed, the case   against    the store and owner already may exist, for the most part, by a drug subject    currently cooperating with investigators. Moreover, investigators should substantiate    statements relative to the store owner’s knowledge of the drug dealer’s    use of the products by a consensual covert recording in the store. The store    owner’s cooperation is more likely forthcoming if the individual believes    that investigators are ready to raid the business.       Covert    Approach: Owner Unaware            In    this approach, investigators conduct surveillance of customers away from a cut    store using an arbitrarily applied factor, such as following anyone carrying    an agreed-upon size bag or box from the store. Investigators can use this approach    only when drug paraphernalia sales account for nearly all sales made from the    store or if the paraphernalia sales can be readily distinguished from legitimate    sales (e.g., if the only legal merchandise in the store is tires or bicycles).    Because no one within the store is assisting investigators, establishing surveillance    without detection poses the largest problem. The Shop Light investigation employed    remote-controlled “pole cameras” to relay activity at the shop to    a monitoring site. The monitor would then broadcast to surveillance units the    physical and vehicle descriptive information for individuals meeting the agreed-upon    prerequisite.            Shop    Light investigators determined that even when some shop owners learned of the    surveillance, they were powerless to do anything  ab out    it. They could not warn their customers, fearing a loss of profits, and they    could not complain to authorities because they were attempting to create an    air of ignorance as to the actual use of the products.       RAIDING    THE DRUG GANGS            Experience    has shown that where members take the package of paraphernalia is the central    hub (safe house) for the gang. Here, the gang stores significant amounts of    drugs, cash, and other such items as weapons and records. Surveillance of that    location will identify the hierarchy of the organization, including many individuals    not involved in the actual street sales of drugs.       The    only people allowed into this site while the drugs are being prepared for distribution    are the most trusted members of the gang.            Probable    cause to raid a gang’s central hub or safe house must be drawn from facts    that investigators develop after identifying its location. This occurs primarily    to protect the technique of ongoing surveillance of the cut shop for      future use    against other gangs. Further, most judges will not consider following a package    from a store, even a known cut shop, sufficient probable cause to issue a search    warrant in the case of the covert surveillance. The affidavit would expose the    cooperation of the store owner/manager in the overt method. Normal investigative    procedures will develop the probable cause necessary to raid the safe house.             During    Shop Light, investigators frequently developed probable cause to support a search    warrant by retrieving trash containing packaging wrappers for paraphernalia    discarded from the identified safe house location, intercepting the delivery    of drugs from the stash house when transported to a worker at a site where the    drugs were sold, and stopping departing vehicles a distance away from the house    if a legal reason existed. In many instances, investigators developed the requisite    probable cause to support a search warrant in a matter of hours after identifying    the gang’s safe house. Some of the surveillances identified subjects of    ongoing investigations conducted by other agencies. Shop Light investigators    contacted officers from these agencies who then assumed investigative responsibility    from the Shop Light team at the safe house. In each case encountered, the investigating    agency had not previously identified the location.            As    a cautionary note, while conducting the initial surveillance away from the cut    store, investigators must not get too aggressive. It is better to lose the      subjects than    to needlessly expose the surveillance. The subjects will return to the store    on future dates to purchase additional diluents/adulterants and packaging, and    investigators might have better luck with the surveillance at that time.        CLOSING    THE STORES            After    using the paraphernalia stores to locate and eliminate as many gangs as deemed    worthwhile, the final action should be to close the shops. Depending upon the    number of stores and the evidence collected against each, authorities will have    to decide between federal or state prosecution. Criteria used in deciding which    venue to use for the Shop Light investigation included—     •        the prior criminal history of the store owner;     •       the assets possessed by the store owner;     •     the    amount of business in paraphernalia conducted by each store and legitimate versus    illegitimate sales proceeds;     •       whether a store was involved in retail, wholesale, or a combination    of sales;     •     whether    the owner exercised control over other stores, including material stocked or    prices charged;     •       whether weapons were seized from the business;         •         whether surveillance of subjects away from a store       •     produced      a prosecutable drug case; and       •         whether the owner conducted regional/national sales via      mail order or Internet advertising.     EXAMINING      THE RESULTS              The    Shop Light investigation resulted in the arrests of approximately 80 significant    drug dealers. Investigators seized multiple kilograms of heroin and cocaine,    weapons, cash, and vehicles usually within hours of the first sightings of the    drug dealers. Twenty federal indictments of drug paraphernalia distributors,    four of whom were charged with the minimum mandatory 20-year CCE violation,      were handed    down along with 25 state indictments of other drug paraphernalia distributors.    The investigation also closed 30 Balti-more area businesses engaged in paraphernalia    sales, a California chemical wholesaler specializing in the national distribution    of diluents and adulterants, and an importing company that distributed diluents    along the east coast of the United States used in selling 40,000 pounds of heroin    at street-level purity with a volume of drug sales approaching $1 billion. In    addition, Shop Light resulted in   numerous    spin-off drug investigations to include international subjects importing drugs    into the United States.

The approach represents another proven method that    agencies can employ in the battle against drug distribution. A major benefit    of using this technique is that it produces instant identification of the upper    echelon   members    of numerous drug gangs and identifies the gangs’ principle operating locations    in a minimum of time without relying upon unpredictable informants. Concentrating    on the trail of drug paraphernalia leads to those who traffic in such illicit    substances, provides a means of uncovering illegal drug operations, and shows    those involved in these criminal activities that no aspect of the drug trade    will be safe from the scrutiny of law enforcement agencies dedicated to ridding    society of the scourge of drug abuse.            The     Bulletin’s       E-mail Address         The     FBI    Law Enforcement Bulletin     staff invites you to communicate with us via e-mail.

Perspective        Addressing    the Need for a Uniform Definition of Gang-Involved Crime       By Mike    Langston       A    key issue in combating youth gangs is providing a uniform definition for them,    distinguishing them from troublesome youth groups and adult criminal organizations. 1             A     group    must be involved in a pattern of criminal acts to be considered a youth gang.    These groups typically are composed of only juveniles, but may include young    adults in their memberships.” 2     “A criminal street gang refers to three or more persons having a common    identifying sign or symbol or an identifiable leadership who continuously or    regularly associate in the commission of criminal activities.” 3     “A street gang is a cohesive group, with most members between the ages    of 11 and 21, that has a recognizable geographical territory (usually defined    with graffiti), leadership, a purpose, and various levels of organized continuous    course of criminal activities.” 4     These    three examples of what constitutes a gang illustrate the variety of definitions    of the term. With the surge in gang-involved criminal activity over the past    20 years, it would seem likely that the law enforcement community would have    a commonly recognized definition for what typically is called gang-related or    gang-motivated crime. The need for such a definition within the community would    appear obvious on its face. However, a review of published books, articles,    and law enforcement policies revealed that no uniform definition used openly    articulates what constitutes a gang-involved crime. 5     Rather, considerable differences existed in what the law enforcement profession    considers as gang-related or gang-motivated crime. Such variations in definitions    and reporting characteristics can lead to inaccurate and unreliable gang-related    crime statistics, which, in turn, can distort any national estimate of the gang      problem and    the extent of gang-related crime. What can the law enforcement community do    to remedy this?              Lieutenant Langston    serves with the Aurora, Illinois, Police Department.            THE    IMPORTANCE OF UNIFORMITY            “The    definition problem is not trivial. How to define a youth gang is one of the    most contentious issues in the field of youth crime. Policymakers, law enforcement    personnel, social service agencies, researchers, and other groups have not been    able to reach consensus on this issue over the past 25 years, and current efforts    to reach this goal have thus far met with only limited success. There is little    disagreement among those who study or deal with gangs that the availability    and widespread use of a uniform definition would be extremely useful for a variety    of important purposes, but few are willing to relinquish and replace the definitions    that have become established within their agencies and are intimately related    to agency operations....” 6     Herein lies the issue that can lead to vagueness, conflict, and denial, without    a uniform gang-involved crime definition.            With    these difficulties in mind, the author suggests a uniform gang-involved crime    definition that   he    believes can consider both the gang member-based and activity-based issues.    Adoption of a uniform policy would benefit the entire law enforcement community    in several ways.     •     All    in law enforcement could communicate in the same “definition language”    and would understand what someone from another agency meant when referring to    a gang member or a gang-involved crime.     Law    enforcement officers would better understand their own agency’s policy    on gang-member and gang-involved crime definitions and could apply those definitions    when documenting gang reports and investigating gang-involved crime.     •      Officers    could provide more complete and accurate information in police reports, improving    the content and accuracy of police records.     •      Databases    from different agencies could share information in common terms, reducing confusion    about whether a person is a gang member and in which, if any, jurisdiction.     •     Trainers    could communicate the same information when instructing law enforcement personnel    on gang awareness, identification, investigation, prosecution, and prevention.    Training materials would cover the same information and criteria.         •     Commonality      would exist when discussing gang members or gang-involved crime with prosecutors,      thereby aiding in the case presentation at trial for motive (common design)      and method of operation, as well as sentencing proceedings.       •      Courts      and juries would better understand the testimony of expert witnesses on the      issue of gang members and gang-involved crime as departmental, or even state      or federal, law enforcement operating guidelines would document the explanations      given by these witnesses.     •      Corrections      facilities would better understand incoming inmates and their gang involvement,      if any.         For these      reasons, as well as others, the law   enforcement      community should address the need for a uniform gang-member definition. A      set of definitions—open enough to encompass all of the relevant criteria,      yet specific enough for courts to accept and uphold—incorporated into      a model operational policy could offer a workable and practical solution for      classifying gang members and gang-involved crime.         A    MODEL POLICY            The    author offers this policy as an example of addressing the current need for a    uniform definition for gang crime and gang members and to outline a set of working    guidelines for the law enforcement community. The definitions include, but are    not limited to, members and associates of criminal street gangs, criminal motorcycle    gangs, criminal hate groups, and criminal extremist groups.       Definitions             •         Criminal gang :    A group of people following a common code of conduct, having common beliefs    and identifiers, existing in a semistructured organization or hierarchy, and    attempting to accomplish their goals through criminal activity.          •     Criminal gang member/associate :    A person involved with a criminal gang who either bears a tattoo that represents    a specific gang or states his or her membership in a specific gang. In addition,    a combination of two or more of the following items can establish criminal gang    association in a specific criminal gang and two or more of these on three or    more occasions can establish criminal gang membership in a specific criminal    gang: wears clothing that contains the colors or symbols of a specific criminal    gang; exhibits jewelry that represents a specific criminal gang; displays hand      signs or other    gestures or speaks a slogan of a specific criminal gang; associates with known    criminal gang members at established criminal gang locations or hangouts; and    has information meeting any of these criteria verified by a law enforcement    agency.          •     Gang-involved crime :    Any criminal acts, including but not limited to those, involving gang members    or gang associates committed for the benefit or furtherance of any criminal    gang or analyzed by a law enforcement officer with specialized training in identifying    criminal gang associates, members, or gang activity based on a reasonable application    of that specialized knowledge who can articulate facts that indicate criminal    gang involvement.   Reporting    Instructions            Agencies    should classify criminal incidents that involve a person or activity that meets    the definitions for a criminal gang, criminal gang member/associate, or gang-involved    crime as a gang-involved crime. A gang-involved crime report must have the appropriate    boxes (criminal gang member/associate involved as a victim, suspect, or complainant;    criminal gang identifiers involved; and criminal gang activity involved) checked    in the gang-involved crime section of the report.       The    incident report should document all known details and facts of criminal gang    members/associates or criminal gang activity involved in the incident. In the    event that the incident does not require a report, officers should document    the information on a criminal gang member/associate information form or an investigative    information report. In either case, officers should submit these documents to    their supervisor for approval. After approval, the supervisor forwards the documents    to the records division for data entry and then to the appropriate investigative    division. The supervisor also should include any relevant information for immediate    street operations planning on the appropriate shift pass-along information file    in the computer system. This information then becomes available for crime suppression    operations planning by patrol and special operations supervisors when applicable.                         Training              All    officers should receive training on gang awareness and identification. Training    objectives should provide relevant information on—   •    definitions of a criminal gang, criminal gang member/associate, and gang-involved    crime;    •    legal issues addressing criminal gang member/associate identifications, field    stops, and investigations;    •    criminal gang identifiers and common types of criminal gang activities;    •    locations typically used by criminal gangs; and     •    effective street investigation tactics and techniques for criminal gang activity    and gang-involved crime.     Information    Sharing            Information    sharing is critical to effective law enforcement planning. Agencies should use    gang-involved crime information for analysis purposes, including, but not limited    to, crime-occurrence mapping, crime statistics, crime patterns and trends, police    resource allocation, crime suppression planning, and community-oriented policing    direction.            Agencies    should produce daily gang information bulletins based on the review of gang-crime    incident reports, criminal gang member/associate information forms, investigative    information reports, and other relevant data. They can use these bulletins,    documented in the shift information computer file, not only for in-services    but every day throughout each   shift.    They also can use them in planning crime suppression operations and for crime    analysis. In addition, agencies should review current crime-mapping printouts    at in-services, along with any relevant crime analysis information.            Crime    analysts should compile weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual reports and distribute    them to all supervisory and command-level personnel, along with statistical    reports showing comparisons of historical patterns, current levels, and future    forecasts of potential trends. These reports should serve to keep a continuous    flow of information on gang-involved crime available for resource allocation,    operations planning, and response effectiveness evaluations.            Supervisors    should review all documentation closely and assure that all relevant information    is included and formatted properly. Accurate information collected, documented,    processed, and analyzed in a timely fashion greatly enhances effectiveness in    planning and scheduling and in investigations and other operational considerations.    This information establishes a strategy to focus daily, weekly, and long-term    goals to drive an agency’s efforts to reduce gang-involved crime. It also    serves to evaluate these efforts and to adjust the plans and operations for    peak performance.       Investigations             To    gather as much gang-related information as possible, agencies should endeavor    to interview every criminal gang member/associate arrested. These interviews    would be in addition to any criminal case investigation interviews in an attempt    to gain additional gang-related information or to corroborate current gang-involved    crime data. Interviewers should concentrate on learning about gang hierarchies,    leadership, membership, meeting information and locations, criminal activities,    rivalry, and any other relevant criminal gang information.            Officers    would document all information gained from these interviews on the appropriate    forms, duly   submitting    them to and processing them through the proper division for analysis. Supervisory    personnel would determine the practicality of distributing any information gained    through these interviews and the appropriate recipients for use in planning,    scheduling, operations, and investigations.       Legal    Issues            This    model policy serves as a set of guidelines for defining, classifying, and processing    criminal gang crime information. The collection, documentation, analysis, and    distribution of any information always would be within the applicable laws and    procedures. 7     Agencies    should address any questions on proper action through their training divisions,    supervisors, or command-level officers who would decide the appropriate action    or obtain further direction from their legal departments or advisors.        CONCLUSION             There    appears to be as many definitions for gang-related or gang-motivated crime as    there are different law enforcement agencies in the United States. Such a quandary    does little to help the law enforcement community reduce the ever-increasing    threat of gangs and their criminal activities. By agreeing upon a uniform definition    of what constitutes a criminal gang, what describes a person as a member/ associate    of a gang, and what unlawful acts comprise gang-involved crime, the law enforcement    profession can begin the difficult, but not impossible, task of reversing the    current menace that has engulfed many of America’s young people and their    communities.            Additionally,    a model policy that incorporates a broad range of criteria and gives the criminal    justice system a workable, comprehensive classification of gang members and    gang-involved crime can lead to a truer picture of the gang problem in America    and focus resources on this growing concern. The dedicated officers who strive    daily to rescue young people from the clutches of gang membership and who also    see the ravages inflicted upon the victims of   gang-involved    crime deserve the support of a law enforcement community united in its effort    to combat gangs and their criminal activities.

Crime    Data       National    Crime Victimization Survey       T he    U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has announced    that the nation’s violent crime rate fell 10 percent in 2001, continuing    a trend observed since 1994.   Violent    victimization and property crime rates in 2001 are the lowest recorded since    the National Crime Victimization Survey’s inception in 1973. There were    an estimated 44 million personal and household crimes that year, compared to    24.2 million during 2001.            In    2001, there were approximately 18.3 million property crimes (burglary, motor    vehicle theft, and household theft) and 5.7 million violent personal crimes    (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and simple and aggravated assault). The decline    in violent crimes in 2001 was attributable primarily to a drop in simple assaults.             According    to victim self-reports, most male victims of violence were victimized by strangers,    whereas the majority of females were victimized by someone they knew. About    1 in 3 victims of violence faced an offender armed with a weapon; 1 in 11 victims    of violence said the offender had a firearm. Firearm use in crime has significantly    declined; it accounted for 12 percent of all violent crime in 1994 and 9 percent    in 2001. Additionally, between 1993 and 2000, FBI murder data show a decrease    of 42 percent in the per capita rate of murder, a drop from 9.5 murders per    100,000 U.S. residents to 5.5 per 100,000 residents.            The    report, “Criminal Victimization 2001, Changes 2000-2001 with Trends 1993-2001""    (NCJ 194610), was written by BJS statistician Callie Rennison.

The    Violence of Hmong Gangs and the Crime of Rape                   T hroughout    the United States, the number of Hmong gangs and the level of their criminal    activity is increasing in severity. Their participation in criminal activity    has evolved over time. During that evolution, they have become involved in a    wide range of crimes, such as homicides, gang rapes, prostitution, home invasions,    burglaries, auto thefts, and, most recently, the sale and distribution of illicit    drugs.            The    crime of rape, however, with its violent nature, its strong incorporation into    the gang’s operational structure, and the serious implications for the    victim and the overall Hmong community,   represents    a particular concern to the law enforcement profession and requires a special    focus to find ways of decreasing its occurrence. To this end, the law enforcement    community must examine the unique structure of Hmong gangs, including their    historical and cultural influences, and the characteristics of the “ritual”    use of rape by these gangs and the impact on the victims. 1        Exploring    Hmong Gang Structure            The    Hmong gangs started forming in St. Paul and Ramsey County, Minnesota, in the    mid-1980s. 2     The first Hmong gang in Minnesota, the Cobra gang, began as a group of      teenage friends    who played on a soccer team. At the time, the majority lived in housing projects    and banded together to protect themselves and other Hmong youth from the racism    occurring in their schools and neighborhoods. Eventually, some members of the    Cobra soccer team became involved in crimes, leading to the evolution of the    Cobra gang. These crimes started out as fights, thefts, and other minor crimes,    but soon led to more serious crimes, such as auto theft and aggravated assault.             Around    1988, some 10- and 11-year-old Hmong youths wanted to become members of the    Cobra gang. After being told that they   were    too young, they decided to start their own gang, the White Tigers. The White    Tiger gang was, perhaps, the first Hmong gang to break into gun shops to obtain    weapons. They would steal a car, drive it through the front door of a gun shop,    and have individuals go into the store, break the glass out of the gun cases,    and scoop guns (usually only semiautomatic handguns) into a bag. In just a few    minutes, the gang could acquire 20 to 30 guns. With these weapons, the White    Tigers became the first of the active and violent Hmong gangs in Minnesota.             In    addition to these two gangs, several others, such as the Oroville Mono Boys,    Oriental Ruthless Boys, and Asian Crips, exist in Minnesota and throughout the    country. These gangs, comprised of many members, operate in Califor-nia, North    and South Carolina, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Michigan, Ohio,    and Wisconsin.            Because    Hmong gangs are not as organized as African-American and Hispanic gangs in leadership    and rank structure, their members do not need to ask a leader for permission    before committing a crime. In fact, some members of the gang may not know that    their own members have perpetrated a crime.            In    addition, Hmong gangs often resort to violence, as was the case in the St. Paul/Minneapolis    area during the summer of 1999. Within about a 6-week period, at least 22 reported    shootings resulted in two deaths and 14 injuries. The majority of these shootings    occurred among four rival gangs, the White Tigers,   Oroville    Mono Boys, Purple Brothers, and Oriental Ruthless Boys. This violence primarily    resulted from the abundant availability of guns within the gangs and the need    to “save face” by not backing down or showing weakness to a rival    gang.            Moreover,    Hmong gangs have considerable mobility. It is not uncommon for gang members    to drive from California to North Carolina, stopping en route to visit fellow    gang members in other states, such as Minnesota or Wisconsin. Many times, these    gangs transport guns to another state and commit crimes in transit. Because    of this mobility, law enforcement agencies investigating these gangs must maintain    a high level of communication to effectively track gang activity.             Sergeant Straka serves with the    St. Paul, Minnesota, Police Department.    Understanding    the Role of Rape            In    addition to their violent tendencies toward rival gang members, the Hmong gangs    also present a   violent    threat to people who are not members of gangs. The most frequent and violent    crimes against nongang members are rape and prostitution.            Since    1997, authorities have received reports of several gang rapes, kidnappings,    prostitution rings, and other violent sexual assaults involving Hmong gang members.    The majority of the victims in these incidents are juvenile Hmong females. For    example, during the fall of 1997, St. Paul officers conducted an investigation    involving members of three Hmong gangs meeting juvenile Hmong females on the    “G-Line” (a message service using an access code where individuals    can leave messages and others can listen to them). Mainly used by gang members    who would call and disrespect rival gangs, the service also attracted young    females who would call to listen to the messages. In such cases, some of the    victims, 12 to 15 years old, arranged   to    meet the gang members from the “G-Line.” The victims went willingly    with the males, but, in one case, the victim was kidnapped. The girls thought    that they were just going for a ride or to a party. Instead, gang members took    them to an attic of a garage or a house, turned off the lights or put a blanket    over their heads, and raped them. The gang members called this “doing the    Ninja” as the victim could not identify who had sexually assaulted her.    Several different cases, with multiple victims, occurred over a period of time.    However, the first victims did not report the assault until several days later,    and the other victims had to be located and asked to make police reports. Gaining    the trust of the victims and working in the Hmong community eventually led authorities    to arrest and obtain convictions of eight members of three different gangs.             While    other such incidents occurred in Minnesota, the mobility of Hmong gangs resulted    in similar crimes in other states. For example, in Warren, Michigan, several    members of a Hmong gang were arrested for repeatedly raping teenage girls who    they had held prisoner for nearly 3 weeks. The gang had kidnapped some of the    girls and also had transported others from state to state and prostituted them.    The victims came from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.            Also,    authorities in Fresno, California, uncovered a similar case when the first three    victims, 12-to 14-year-old Hmong girls, came forward in April 1998. Members    of the gang held the girls for 2 days at a local motel. After further      investigation,    officers discovered several other victims who agreed to come forward. Investigators    identified a total of 33 victims between January 1997 and April 1998. The gang    had held the victims anywhere from 2 days to 3 months.            The    lead investigator stated that the case was so large that officials had to pursue    it in three phases. 3     In the first phase, the grand jury handed down 350 indictments on 14 suspects.    Eleven of the suspects pled guilty and received sentences ranging from 17 to    31 years in   prison.    Two other gang members got 280 years and 4 months and 94 years and 4 months,    respectively, in prison. The second phase consisted of the grand jury handing    down a 323-count indictment and several of the suspects pleading guilty. The    third phase included 9 victims and 20 suspects, in which the grand jury handed    down an 826-count indictment. Several suspects pled guilty and others were found    guilty. The lead investigator also said that during the 2-year investigation,    10 percent of the victims stayed with the   gang    and were not threatened by its members. The rest were lured, kidnapped, and    forced into unwilling participants. The gang held the victims against their    will, repeatedly raped them, and forced them into prostitution. Gang members    displayed guns and beat and threatened those victims who tried to leave.             These    cases represent just a small number of the known and reported gang rapes occurring    across the country involving Hmong street gangs. What makes these cases so similar    is that the victims were afraid to come forward and, in most cases, did so reluctantly.    Also, other victims in the cases would not come forward. One of the reasons    for this reluctance to come forward was fear of the gang members because they    had produced guns, talked about the “shootings” they had been involved    in, and threatened to assault the victims or kill their families if they talked.    After the victims were raped, they feared being shunned by members of their    families who now would consider them “damaged” or having “shamed”    them. This reaction stems from the Hmong culture, which values virginity before    marriage. If a girl is raped, others in the Hmong community may look down on    her. The gang members also used this belief to their advantage. They told the    victims that they were no good to their families and that the gang was now their    family. “There is a double standard for Hmong girls, the blaming and shame    is big, and the girls give up when they see they are not getting support from    their family and the community.” 4     Some of the victims stayed with the gang   members    even after they were raped. They felt that they had nowhere else to go because    they feared their own families more than the gang members.            These    gang rapes and prostitution of young females are happening everywhere, not just    in large cities. “There is a market out there for young girls, and the    Hmong community is not seeing this, they are not acknowledging it.” 5           Investigating    Hmong Gang Rapes            Due    to their violent behavior, high degree of mobility, and broad level of contacts    around the country, Hmong gangs require law enforcement agencies to practice    quality tactics and maintain adequate communication when conducting investigations.    One of the most important aspects in the investigation of a gang rape involves    what the street officer does at the scene. The street officer may not even know    that a crime has occurred or may believe that some juveniles only have been    drinking. All officers have responded to calls where they encounter a group    of young males and females who have been drinking at a house or a motel. The    difference in incidents involving Hmong females with older males is that there    probably has been more happening than just drinking. Officers on the scene of    such incidents should—          •        compare      the ages of the females to the ages of the males (11- to 13-year-old females      in a room with adult or teenage males indicates a problem);       •        separate      the females from the males and from each other (the females may be more afraid      of the police than of the males with them);       •        ask      the females their names, maybe more than once (they may lie because they are      afraid to go home, or they may be runaways);       •        ask      the females how long they have been with the males in the room, how they know      them, and where they met the males; •        question      the males about who they are and how they know the females;       •        search      the room for evidence of sexual assaults, including condom wrappers, condoms,      and blood on the mattresses;       •        check      the motel records to determine who rented the room; and       •        note      and photograph any gang graffiti (if officers are unsure           whether    a crime occurred, they should make every effort to ensure that they properly    identify everyone, including photographing the people involved and the surroundings).    When assigned a gang rape or prostitution case involving a Hmong female victim,    the investigator may face difficulties. The incident may have happened days    or weeks earlier and little or no evidence may exist. The victim may be a runaway    or may have left home willingly with a group of unknown males or gang members.    Regardless, investigators must trust the victim, gain her trust, and not question    her judgment in allowing herself to become a victim or not reporting the incident    in a timely manner. The victim not only has been sexually assaulted and threatened    but also faces possible cultural consequences. One 12-year-old victim stated,    “I was given two choices; the gang would kill me if I talked, or I could    just keep hanging out with the gang members and they could have sex with me    when they wanted.” She also said that she was afraid to tell anyone because,    being Hmong, she was afraid of what her parents would do to her. She felt as    though her parents would blame her for getting raped, yell at her, hit her,    or, worse, kick her out of the house.            To    conduct a thorough investigation and to be respectful of the victim, investigators    should consider several factors. They may have to talk to the victim several    times, just to get new information and to gain her trust. Only one person should    interview the victim,   usually    someone who has gained the victim’s trust. If it can be avoided, a male    Hmong officer should not interview the victim. The Hmong officer can help identify    the suspects, but the victim may hesitate to discuss the matter with a Hmong    male. The investigator should attempt to find help from the Hmong community    for the victim and her family. Also, according to the lead investigator of the    Fresno, California, cases, investigators should “recognize the impact of    threats, violence, retaliation, length of time held, prostitution, culture issues,    and overall condition of the victim. Keep these issues in mind when starting    to interview. These victims have been severely traumatized. Remember that everyone    shows or reacts to a situation differently. Don’t go into the interview    expecting the victim to act in any certain way.” 6     In    prostitution cases, it may prove difficult to identify the pimps and to obtain    evidence. The pimps are Hmong who usually only offer the girls to other Hmong,    often older members of the community. They bring the victims to unknown locations    or motels, as well as transporting them to other cities and states.            One    of the most difficult aspects of the investigation is keeping the victim from    disappearing. Many of these young Hmong girls have been runaways. After they    do come forward, they are under opposing pressure from the police, suspects,    friends, and family members. Investigators must maintain almost constant contact    with the victim and continue to reassure her that   she    did the right thing by coming forward.            Even    after the investigation concludes, other people, such as defense attorneys and    members of the Hmong community, will scrutinize the victims. The effects of    the crime on its victims may be minimized or viewed as typical teenage behavior.    After the guilty charges in the Fresno case, the local newspaper reported comments,    such as “A bunch of kids were doing the wrong thing. It was a big party,    a moving summer party. You blame somebody else, I’m not saying these guys    are all these innocent angels.       They’re    not. They’re gang members, but certainly forcible rape, to me, is out of    the question. The girls themselves were gang members, too, a lot of people disagree    with the girls for charging the boys with raping them. We, as parents, would    want to put them both into jail. Not everyone believed the girls.” 7     Although cultural issues may interfere, prosecution of these cases must continue.        Conclusion             Law    enforcement can more effectively investigate and prosecute   cases    of Hmong gang rapes and prostitution. Networking among law enforcement agencies    throughout the country is imperative due to the mobility of Hmong gangs. More    important, understanding the Hmong culture and the role of the gangs in the    community and following the specific guidelines for investigation will equip    the law enforcement profession to better address the needs of the victims involved    in gang rapes and prostitution. Working with the victims will bring the perpetrators    to justice and ultimately put a stop to Hmong gang rapes.

He has    talked to hundreds of Hmong gang members in custodial and noncustodial situations    and investigated numerous crimes involving Hmong gangs, including homicides,    assaults, rapes, and prostitution rings.            2     Originally from China, some Hmong left due to persecution and traveled to Vietnam    and Laos around 1740. They fought alongside U.S. troops and rescued downed pilots    during the war in Vietnam. This alliance resulted in persecution by the Vietnamese    government, and many Hmong immigrated to the United States, first settling in    California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. With additional families immigrating to    America, at least 36 states now have Hmong populations.            3     Detective Brenda Trobaugh, Fresno, California, Police Department.            4     Na Ly Yang, executive director of Women’s Association of Hmong and Lao,    in St. Paul, Minnesota.       5     Ibid.  6     Supra note 3.            7     These comments from various individuals connected with the case appeared in    the July 14 and 15, 2000, issues of the  Fresno    Bee .            Book    Review     Confronting    Gangs: Crime and the Community         b y G. David Curry and Scott H. Decker, Roxbury Publishing Co., Los Angeles,    California, 1998.         Confronting    Gangs: Crime and the Community     provides the gang investigator or police administrator with an easily understood    overview of important topics relevant to criminal street gangs. The authors    draw from their own experiences, a wide range of previously conducted studies,    and gang member interviews to explain the often-confusing world of gangsters    and those who attempt to work with them. The book concludes with a number of    suggested prevention or intervention methods available to agencies confronted    with either existing or emerging gang problems.              Developing    a realistic law enforcement strategy to deal with gangs must start with a good    definition of what constitutes a “gang.” The book points out the problems    a jurisdiction can experience by denying or failing to understand a gang presence    in its community.  Confronting    Gangs  employs    diverse sources to reach a widely applicable composite description for a criminal    street gang. Using the guidelines given in this description, the gang investigator    or police administrator can guide discussions with political leaders and community    residents to reach a consensus on the existence or degree of the gang problem    in their area.            The    amount of criminal activity gang members engage in represents a major aspect    of the gang dilemma. The authors use a variety of studies and other information    to demonstrate that gang members, as a group, are involved in more criminal    activity and delinquency than nongang members. The authors advance an important    conclusion for gang investigators to consider: gang solidarity is a product    of external forces as opposed to internal dynamics. Therefore, instead of dismantling    a criminal street gang, police efforts and well-meaning social programs, if    not properly managed, inadvertently may provide an opportunity for growth.      Curry    and Decker draw from their own experiences and gang member interviews to discuss    what gangsters may face during their time in that subculture. While street gangs    come in a variety of shapes and sizes, most lack any real organization or structure.    However, the authors recognize important exceptions, such as the Gangster Disciples    and other Chicago-based gangs, which are well organized. They identify violence    as an important part of a gang’s makeup. Violent acts committed against    the gang call for retaliation, which leads to a circle composed of more violent    acts. As a result, gang members are more likely than nongang members to be victims    or perpetrators of assaults. Fear of violence then becomes a unifying factor    for gangsters.            The    authors identify members and discuss the roles and leadership of street gangs.    They interviewed gangsters about leaving the street gang and dispel one popular    myth: most gangsters simply leave the gang when it is appropriate for them.    Curry and Decker indicate that most street gangs hold meetings, often on an    irregular basis. They describe leaders as resembling “captains of sports    teams” whose roles can change quickly. Law enforcement officials involved    in targeting gangs must understand these facts and structure intervention efforts    appropriately.            The    authors indicate in their discussions regarding drug sales by gang members that    the amount of organization present in the gang may contribute to the level of    drug sales by the group’s members. Party gangs may sell enough drugs to    fund their partying. Gangs that deal crack cocaine at the street level often    are loosely organized because their customers demand ready and easy access to    the product. Information of this nature could be an important consideration    when the structure and goal of an investigation is determined.            A    discussion of females as gang members covers a variety of topics. The authors    advance a thought-provoking argument that female gang members are more in danger    of suffering emotional damage than their male counterparts   because    of their traditional role in the family and child rearing. They also mention    the role females sometimes play in dismantling a gang by pulling male members    away.  Confronting    Gangs     indicates that a distinct need exists for more research when it comes to the    involvement of females in the gang subculture.            Curry    and Decker devote the last two chapters of the book to a discussion of intervention    and prevention strategies. The authors provide enough information on each entry    to allow readers to decide if it would be an appropriate program to study for    application to an identified gang problem in their communities. As an aid, the    book points out areas of concern that have arisen when others have employed    some of the initiatives mentioned.            The    book concludes with an examination of the future of gangs in the United States.    The authors point out that the historical pattern for street gangs is one of    ebb and flow. Gangs will flourish for a time, and, then, as social conditions      change, they    will diminish to the point of almost disappearing. The growth of a permanent    under-class with high unemployment represents the current trend that Curry and    Decker see as having the strongest influence on future gangs. Coupled with the    spread of the gang ideology by media sources and popular culture, the high unemployment    will contribute to gang members staying with their gangs well into adulthood.    Older gang members may lead to more organized gangs, with profit from illegal    activities playing an increasingly important role in the gang’s makeup.             Gang    investigators and police executives who develop enforcement policies for their    agencies should read  Confronting    Gangs: Crime and Community .    Moreover, many of the programs the authors identify blend well with community-policing    initiatives that agencies already may have implemented.            Reviewed    by Captain David Allender Indianapolis, Indiana, Police Department            ViCAP    Alert       Attention:    Sex Crimes and Robbery Units       Unsolved    Sex Crime                         The    Madison, Wisconsin, Police Department requests assistance in an ongoing serial    sexual assault investigation. Since the spring of 1999, nearly two dozen unsolved    sexual assault attacks have occurred at southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois    mall and strip mall stores and parking lots. In all cases, a lone white male    stalked and attacked young white female store clerks working alone or customers    and clerks as they walked to their vehicles in the late afternoon or evening    hours. The suspect selected, stalked, and spoke to the victims before attacking    them from behind. In many cases, he used a knife to gain control and compliance    in getting victims into their cars or a store bathroom.       Crime    Scenes            The    suspect appears comfortable traveling long distances between attack sites and    has selected victims in malls around the Madison area, as well as in the jurisdictions    of Janesville, Fond du Lac, Johnson Creek, Cottage Grove, and Monona, Wiscon-sin,    and Roscoe, Illinois. For the past 3 years, he has effected a pattern of discontinuing    the attacks in Wisconsin around the month of September and returning in late    January or early February. For this reason, investigators believe that he may    be traveling for work or other reasons and perpetrating elsewhere.            Law    enforcement officers should pay particular attention to all calls dispatched    to mall and strip mall stores and parking lots between 1 p.m. and 10 p.m. In    previous cases, officers received dispatches of armed robberies, domestic disturbances,    suspicious person complaints, and exposure incidents, as well as sexual assaults.    As a result of this initial call confusion, response sometimes was slow or given    low priority, resulting in the suspect’s escape and loss of evidence from    the scenes. Therefore, regardless of the nature of the dispatched call, if it    occurs at a mall or strip mall store in the afternoon or evening hours, responding    officers should remain alert for this suspect fleeing to a nearby highway.             Officers    should consider this suspect as armed and dangerous and preserve all possible    evidence at the scene, including soft drink cans, cigarette butts, chewing gum,    coins, videotapes, latent fingerprints on doors, and any other items of DNA    or evidentiary value. Suspect DNA currently is on file in CODIS with no known    identification.       Possible    Suspect Information            The    suspect is described as a white male, 25 to 35 years of age, 5' 7"" to 5' 10""    in height, with a stocky build, broad shoulders, and strong hands. He has sandy    brown short hair, with no thinning or receding hairline. He has noticeably blue    eyes, is clean shaven or with a five o’clock shadow and a rough complexion,    and frequently wears a close-fitting baseball cap.            The    suspect has fled the scenes of previous attacks in a metallic ruby red, early    to mid-1990s, full-size, clean pickup truck, possibly a Chevy Silverado or Ford    F-150. The truck may have a narrow midline white or silver horizontal stripe,    a black toolbox with two chrome handles in the bed behind the cab, and a reddish    maroon topper. He also was seen operating a full-size, clean, 1989 to 1995,    gray, Ford F-150, with a gray topper and gray interior, following an attack    in Illinois.       Alert    to Law Enforcement            Law    enforcement agencies should bring this information to the attention of all crime    analysis personnel and officers investigating crimes against persons, sex crimes,    and robberies. Any agency with crimes similar to these should contact Madison    Police Department Detectives Maureen Wall at 608-266-4696, Mark Zwart at 608-266-5935,    or Bruce Frey at 608-245-3656 or Crime Analyst Butch Rabiega of the FBI’s    Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) at 703-632-4170 or Special Agent    Gary Cramer at 703-632-4197.

Focus    on Communications       The    Pen and the Sword       How    to Make the Writing Process Work for You      By Julie R. Linkins, M.A., M.S.             A s    employees advance through the ranks of an agency, the nature of their writing    changes.   Sergeants    write fewer incident reports and more performance evaluations; lieutenants and    captains respond to letters from the public, propose new programs, submit grant    requests and the like; even chiefs and sheriffs may find themselves writing    unfamiliar documents for new audiences. Civilian employees face similar transitions,    from writing standard interagency memos to wide-ranging budget narratives and    annual reports. As one student at the FBI National Academy recently said, “In    law enforcement, there is a point where the gun becomes less of a weapon and    writing becomes more of one.” 1     Law enforcement officers should be proficient with both.            Business    writing is not mysterious, magical, or impossible to learn. Writers at all levels    can follow five logical steps to ensure that their documents get the job done    with minimal fuss and effort. By   answering    a few questions, brainstorming potential information to include, selecting the    needed information and organizing it logically, editing for style, and finally    proofreading for grammar and punctuation, writers can produce successful documents.        Step    One: Prewriting            When    given a writing assignment, inexperienced authors frequently start typing right    away. This approach usually leads to a jumble of rambling thoughts that readers    cannot decipher. Just as officers learn to develop a plan for responding to    a call for service before they arrive at the scene, writers should develop a    plan for composing their documents before they sit down at the computer. Answering    these four basic questions will put writers on the correct path:     •     Who    am I writing to?     •     What    is my purpose?     •     What    action do I want my reader to take?     •  What    is in it for the reader?            The    answers to these questions will help writers form a simple, one-sentence statement    that conveys the essence of their message: a bottom line. This sentence tells    the reader the topic, who is affected, and what will or should happen. Here    are a few examples of bottom lines for everyday documents:       •     Internal    job posting :    To apply for this position in the Drug Unit, you must submit a letter describing    your qualifications to Lieutenant Mary Jones by 1700 hours on 12/20/02.        •     Information    request :    By Tuesday, please send me a spreadsheet showing the projected fleet maintenance    costs for fiscal year 2002.       •     Thank    you letter :    Thank you for speaking to my class today and sharing your expertise in legal    issues.       •     Performance    evaluation :    During the rating period, Mr. Adams met expectations in the areas of oral and    written communications, but he needs to improve his interpersonal skills and    filing system.            An    effective bottom line predicts the information to follow; everything else in    the document should   support    or clarify it. Anything that does not pertain to the bottom line does not belong    in the document.       Step    Two: Brainstorming            With    a clear bottom line on paper, writers can begin brainstorming potential ideas    to include in the document. This step often is called “fast writing”    because the writer seeks to record as many ideas as possible without sorting    or evaluating them. Not every idea generated at this stage will end up in the    final document, but that is okay. Anyone who has participated in a group brainstorming    session probably has experienced the phenomenon of having a silly idea from    one person inspire someone else to think of the perfect solution. The same thing    holds true here. No idea is too absurd or wrong to record during a fast-writing    session.            Writers    employ a variety of fast-writing techniques. Some jot lists of words and phrases    for key ideas, while others use more visual techniques, such as webbing or mind    mapping. Free writing, also known as letter writing, helps some writers generate    ideas; this technique simply involves writing a letter about the topic to a    trusted reader. Still others, encumbered by the tools of writing, talk through    their ideas and record them on audiotape to transcribe into a first draft later.    No matter the fast-writing method used, the objective remains to record as many    ideas related to the bottom line as possible. From this pool of ideas, writers    choose the best ones to include in the final document.       Step    Three: Writing and Organizing            Writers    can choose from many patterns to organize their information. For investigative    reports, chronological order makes the most sense. For other types of documents,    however, chronological order might not serve the reader or the writer well,    so effective writers use different methods of organization.            For    example, proposals frequently describe the problem or current situation first,    follow with the proposed solution, and end with the anticipated results. Progress    and after-action reports follow the same format, only all in past tense. Employee    evaluations might employ a topical or grouping method, describing each performance    element in a set order. Instructions and procedures follow sequential order    from first step to last. Operational plans include a spatial component that    describes the physical layout of the buildings, streets, or locations involved.    Writers should select the pattern that best serves the document’s purpose.        Step    Four: Revising for Style            Clutter,    jargon, ambiguity, and bias can derail even a well-organized document. Unnecessary    verbiage acts like static on the radio; it just adds distracting noise to the    message. Specialized terms, including abbreviated program names or the use of    10-codes in certain situations, exclude readers unfamiliar with the definitions.           Vague    references or unclear descriptions leave readers confused and frustrated. Similarly,    language that exhibits prejudice can anger readers, causing them to dismiss    the writer’s message completely. The style choices writers make in each    of these areas dramatically affect the success of the document; therefore, after    crafting the first draft, writers should carefully review their documents for    clarity, simplicity, specificity, and sensitivity.            Many    kinds of clutter exist, including redundancies (e.g., free gift, fatal slaying),    wordy expressions (e.g., “six individuals of the male persuasion”    versus “six men”), smothered verbs (e.g., “conduct an appraisal”    versus “appraise” or “have expectations” versus “expect”),    and passive voice (e.g., “All homicide cases are investigated by Detective    Larson.” versus “Detective Larson investigates all homicides.”).    Writers should strive for clean sentences that include no unnecessary words.            Writers    also should choose the simplest words possible. Why say “assist with recuperative    maintenance” when “help clean up” will do? When writers use plain    language as much as possible, readers do not mind the occasional difficult or    specialized term. Writers should try not to drown readers in big words or jargon.    Not only does it annoy the reader, it defeats the writer’s purpose because    the audience cannot comprehend the message.            Writers    can make their words more specific by describing observable actions and characteristics    instead of using general conclusions. Rather than reporting that a suspect “appeared    suspicious,” for example, a writer might say that the suspect “left    the car running at the curb, carried a brick in one hand, and peered into the    window of the closed jewelry store.” As the example shows, sometimes it    takes more words to say something clearly. That is okay. Writers must never    sacrifice clarity for brevity.            One    last item for writers to check in this step is bias. Biased language–whether    racial, ethnic, sexist, or otherwise–has no place in careful workplace    writing. Writers should be sensitive to the concerns of their readers.             Such    choices can determine whether a document succeeds or fails. With careful attention    to these four aspects of style, writers will improve the readability of their    documents, help readers who do not have a lot of time to devote to the task,    and ensure that readers receive the intended message.       Step    Five: Proofreading            After    writers ensure that they have organized the content well and removed all clutter,    they must check the fine details of spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Running    the spell check application available in today’s word processing programs    will catch the obvious errors, but it cannot replace a careful line-byline,    word-by-word review. Software programs cannot tell the difference between a    misspelled word and a misused word.            For    the most part, grammar-checking programs perform even more poorly than spell-checking    applications. While they can highlight areas for the writer to examine more    closely, such programs often misunderstand the writer’s meaning and offer    bad advice for corrections. Writers should invest in a good grammar book and    take time to learn the basic rules of grammar and punctuation. Continuing education    courses or in-service training can help employees refresh their skills.             When    in doubt about the correct punctuation, writers should revise the sentence until    they know for certain how to punctuate it. This frequently requires breaking    a complex sentence into two or more simple ones.       Managing    Time            This    time-tested writing process divides a writing task into manageable steps. Some    writers, however, tend to get stuck along the way and run out of time      before completing    all of the steps. To avoid such problems, writers can follow this general guide    for dividing the time they have to complete a document: 2      1) Prewriting 12.5 %    2) Brainstorming 25.0 %    3) Writing and organizing 25.0 %    4) Revising for style 25.0 %    5) Proofreading 12.5 %               Thus,    if a letter needed to go out in an hour, the writer would spend about 7 minutes    answering the prewriting questions and developing a bottom line, 15 minutes    brainstorming, 15 minutes writing and organizing, 15 minutes revising for style,    and 7 minutes proofreading. These times are flexible, so 10 minutes brainstorming    and 20 minutes writing would probably work well, too. The objective is to leave    enough time to complete all five steps.       Conclusion             For    most people, writing well requires study and practice. Law enforcement officers    at all levels should approach learning this skill just like they learned marksmanship    or investigative techniques: begin with the basics, split the task into steps,    practice with feedback, and requalify regularly. With time and practice, the    steps outlined here will become second nature.            Writing    matters. It can help spend or save money, win or lose a case, and cause or avert    danger. Members of the public expect their law enforcement officers to use all    available tools to protect them and keep the peace; members of the department    expect their leaders to do the same. Law enforcement executives must arm themselves    with both the pen and the sword.       Endnotes             1     William J. Weightman, FBINA 206.

HENDRIE,    J.D.            T his    article addresses the “consent once removed” exception to the search    warrant requirement. Under that exception, officers are permitted to make a    warrantless entry to arrest a suspect based on the consent to enter given earlier    to an undercover officer or informant. Knowledge of the law of arrest and search    is important to understanding the doctrine of consent once removed. This article    provides a brief review of those areas before explaining consent once removed.        Review    of Arrest Law            It    is constitutional for a police officer to arrest a suspect in a public place    without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe the arrestee    has committed a crime, regardless of whether that crime is a felony or a misdemeanor. 1     The    common law rule, however, followed in many state and federal statutes, limits    the authority of an officer to make a misdemeanor arrest without a warrant to    circumstances when the suspect commits the misdemeanor in the officer’s    presence. 2     Under the Fourth Amendment, a person could be arrested without a warrant for    a minor offense that is neither violent nor a breach of the peace. 3     While a search   without    a warrant is presumed unreasonable, there is no presumption of unreasonableness    that attaches to a warrantless public arrest. Consequently, it is not constitutionally    required that an officer be faced with an emergency or to obtain consent before    making a public arrest without a warrant. 4             Arresting    a person in public is one thing, entering his home to arrest him is quite another.    When an officer enters a subject’s home and arrests him, not only has the    officer seized the subject but, by entering the home, the officer also has conducted    a Fourth Amendment search of the home. If officers have   an    arrest warrant, they may enter a suspect’s residence to arrest him if they    have probable cause to believe he is home. Even though an arrest warrant is    a seizure warrant and not a search warrant, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled    that an arrest warrant carries with it the implicit authority to enter the residence    of the person named in the warrant to search for him, provided that there is    at least probable cause to believe that he is present in his home. 5     Where    the person named in an arrest warrant is believed to be in a third party’s    home, however, an arrest warrant alone will not suffice to enter the third party’s    home to arrest the suspect. An officer must obtain a search warrant before entering    the third party’s home, unless there is an emergency or the resident gives    consent to search. 6           Review    of Search Law            A    search conducted under the authority of a search warrant is presumed reasonable,    whereas a search conducted without a search warrant is presumed unreasonable. 7     The presumption of unreasonableness for searches conducted without a warrant    can be rebutted through one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement, such    as consent or emergency. The emergency exceptions applicable to building searches    fall into closely circumscribed categories: 1) prevent escape; 8     2) prevent harm to officers or others; 9     3) render immediate aid; 10     4) prevent the destruction of evidence; 11     or 5) hot pursuit. 12     Once the emergency that justified the warrantless entry has passed, the authority    to search without a warrant ends. If the police desire to continue to search    the   premises,    they may secure the area and seek a search warrant.       Consent    Once Removed            Ordinarily,    officers cannot enter premises without a warrant unless they have consent or    there is an emergency. 13     The consent once removed doctrine is an extension of the consent exception to    the search warrant requirement. In circumstances when officers do not have a    warrant and are not faced with an emergency, they still will be able to conduct    a search if they obtain voluntary consent to search from someone who has actual    or apparent dominion and control over the premises. 14     An officer who is working in an undercover capacity can use deception to obtain    valid consent to enter premises. 15     Once an undercover officer obtains the initial consent to enter, that consent    can be transferred to officers who later enter the premises to arrest the suspects.             Under    the doctrine of consent once removed, officers without a search warrant or an    emergency may enter a residence that the   undercover    agent or informant has recently entered if “[t]he undercover agent or informant:    1) entered at the expressed invitation of someone with authority to consent;    2) at that point established the existence of probable cause to effectuate an    arrest or search; and 3) immediately summoned help from other officers.” 16     There is no requirement that the person obtaining the original consent be an    officer of the law. The person obtaining consent could be an informant. 17     Of course, the original consent must be valid to support the second entry by    the arrest team. 18             In     United    States v. Bramble , 19     undercover    federal agents entered the home of a suspect to negotiate the purchase of sea    otter pelts advertised for sale. During negotiations, the suspect showed the    agents parts of a bald eagle, a golden eagle, a horned owl, and a red-tailed    hawk, all of which are unlawful to possess. One of the agents also noticed what    appeared to be a vial of cocaine on the dining room table. After seeing the    illegal bird parts and the suspected cocaine, the undercover   agents    identified themselves and told the suspect that he was going to be placed under    arrest. The agents then called for backup officers to enter the home. The U.S.    Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that once the suspect had given    consent to the undercover agents to enter his home, he lost any expectation    of privacy in the area to which he invited them. The backup officers could then    enter the home upon the authority of the original consent given to the undercover    agents. The entry of additional officers did not infringe upon the consenter’s    expectation of privacy.            It    is dangerous, particularly in drug cases, for an undercover officer to notify    a suspect that he is an undercover officer and then tell the suspect that he    is under arrest, as was done in  Bramble .    The safest tactic would be to have the undercover officer leave the premises    before the arrest team enters to make the arrest. If, for some reason, it is    necessary for the undercover officer to remain inside the premises, the undercover    officer should not arrest the suspect. It would be safer for him to remain in    his undercover role and surreptitiously signal backup officers to enter and    make the arrest. The consent once removed doctrine would apply to the entry    by the arrest team in such a case. For example, in  United    States v. Pollard , 20     an informant and an undercover officer entered a residence to purchase 4 kilograms    of cocaine. Upon seeing the cocaine in the apartment the informant gave the    arrest signal. In response to the arrest signal, approximately six officers,    without knocking or announcing, immediately broke down the   front    door and arrested the defendants. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit    ruled that the entry by the backup officers to arrest the defendants was lawful    under the consent once removed doctrine. The court found that once the defendants    gave the undercover officer and the informant permission to enter, the entry    by the arrest team did not create any further invasion of privacy.            Under    the consent once removed doctrine, the lawfulness of the second entry by the    arrest team is based upon the initial consent given to the undercover officer.    Therefore, because the entry team could force their entry into the premises,    it certainly would be permissible for the entry team to use a ruse to enhance    the safety of the second entry. For example, in  United    States v. Samet , 21     an undercover officer gave a prearranged arrest signal from inside the defendant’s    apartment after he made a purchase of 277 grams of cocaine. Upon receiving the    arrest signal, the entry team rushed into the defendant’s apartment and    announced that they had a search warrant. In fact, the officers did not possess    a search warrant. The U.S. District Court for the East ern    District of Virginia ruled that because the officers were relying upon the original    consent to enter given by the defendant to the undercover officer, the false    statement of an officer that the arrest team had a search warrant did not render    illegal the otherwise legal entry.       No    Emergency Required            Once    an informant or undercover agent obtains consent to enter a residence, there    is no requirement that there be an emergency for officers to follow the informant    or undercover agent into the home without a warrant. All that is needed is the    original voluntary consent, probable cause to arrest, and the informant or undercover    agent immediately summoning the officers to arrest the defendant. 22        In     United    States v. Jachimko, 23      DEA agents    sent an informant, equipped with a recorder and an agent-alert device, into    a suspect’s home. The agents instructed the informant to activate the alert    button only if he saw more than 100 marijuana plants. As is usual in drug cases,    events took a turn toward the unexpected. After the informant entered the suspect’s    home, he and the suspect left the suspect’s home and drove to the house    of another individual named Jachimko. Up to that time, DEA did not have any    suspicion that Jachimko was involved in illegal drug activity, nor did they    suspect that there was marijuana inside his house. Twenty minutes after entering    Jachimko’s house, the in-formant activated the agent-alert button. The    DEA agents responded by knocking on the side door to Jachimko’s home; Jachimko    opened the door, but tried to close   it    when the agents identified themselves. A scuffle ensued, and Jachimko and the    other suspect were arrested. In addition, several marijuana plants were seized.             In     Jachimko ,    the government did not argue that the second entry by the officers into Jachimko’s    residence was justified by an emergency, but, rather, that it was justified    by the original consent given to the informant. The U.S. Court of Appeals for    the Seventh Circuit agreed with the government and ruled that the second entry    was authorized by the initial consent given to the informant. 24     The defendant argued that he withdrew his consent when he refused to allow the    officers to enter after they identified themselves. The court, however, ruled    that once the contraband was discovered by the informant, it was too late for    Jachimko to withdraw his consent.            Jachimko    further argued that the consent obtained by the informant to enter was ineffectual    because there was no preexisting DEA investigation on him, nor was there probable    cause for a search when he gave the informant consent to enter his residence.    The court ruled that there is no legal requirement that there be an investigation    before a suspect can give valid consent and, further, that it is not required    that there be probable cause before consent may be obtained. 25     The only requirement for valid consent is that a person with actual or apparent    authority give voluntary consent. The fact that the informant misrepresented    his purposes for entering the premises did not render the consent given to the    informant involuntary.            The    consent once removed doctrine is particularly helpful in reverse drug operations.    In a reverse drug transaction, the undercover officer acts as the seller of    the drugs. The suspect, being the purchaser of the drugs, is expected to bring    the money. The suspect ordinarily would not be expected to attempt to destroy    money if he believed that he was the object of a police sting. A second entry,    therefore, could not, be based upon the fear that the suspect would destroy    the evidence. The entry of the arrest team, however, could be based upon the    consent given earlier to the undercover officer. 26               Undercover    Officer Leaves and Promises to Return            It    is tactically more sound to arrange ahead of time to have the undercover officer    who is acting as the purchaser of illegal drugs leave the premises after he    sees that the suspects possess the illegal drugs. It is much more dangerous    for the undercover officer to stay in the residence when the arrest team makes    its entry to arrest the suspects. The   suspects    likely will become immediately aware that the cause for the unwelcome entry    of the police is probably the undercover officer. The consent once removed doctrine    requires that once the undercover officer or informant establishes probable    cause to arrest he must immediately summon help from the other officers. Most    courts permit the undercover officer to leave the residence to summon assistance    from the other officers. If the undercover officer makes an arrangement with    the suspect that he will leave the residence to obtain money or some other item    to complete the illegal transaction, the undercover officer could then leave    the residence and lawfully reenter with several backup officers. The legality    of the officers’ reentry would be based on the original consent of the    resident and his expectation that the undercover officer would return.             For    example, in  United    States v. White , 27     an undercover officer and an informant arrived at an apartment to purchase illegal    drugs from suspected drug traffickers. The informant exited the suspects’    apartment, purportedly to obtain money to complete the illegal drug transaction.    The informant was accompanied by one of the suspects who locked the door behind    him with a key. The undercover officer remained in the apartment with another    suspect. Upon arriving at the informant’s automobile, ostensibly to obtain    money for the drug transaction, the accomplice was arrested. The keys found    on the accomplice were used by the backup officers to enter the apartment and    arrest the other suspect. The court expressly refused to consider whether the     second    entry justified the potential harm to the undercover officer, who remained in    the apartment, because the court found that the second entry was authorized    by the initial consent given to the undercover officer and the informant to    enter the apartment.            In     White,     the    undercover officer remained in the apartment. It is not required, however, that    an undercover officer remain behind on the premises after an informant leaves    to have the benefits of the consent once removed exception. That is because    the consent once removed doctrine is not based upon an emergency concern for    the safety of the undercover officer or informant; rather, it is founded on    the premise that the initial consent given by the suspect to an undercover officer    or informant can be transferred to the arrest team, justifying their second    entry.            In     United    States v. Diaz , 28     an undercover officer entered the suspect’s hotel room to negotiate the    purchase of the 8 kilograms of cocaine. Once in the apartment, the undercover    officer was shown the 9 kilograms of cocaine. Upon seeing the cocaine, the undercover    officer told the suspect that he would go to the lobby and call his “money    man,” who would arrive in approximately 30 minutes. The suspect told the    undercover officer that he would wait in the room for him. The undercover officer    exited the hotel room and gave the prearranged signal to the surveillance team    that had gathered in an adjacent hotel room. Minutes later, the undercover officer,    accompanied by the surveillance team, knocked on the suspect’s door, and,    when the   suspect    answered the door, he told the suspect he had forgotten his keys and coat. The    arrest team then immediately pushed past the undercover officer and arrested    the suspect and seized the drugs.            In     Diaz ,    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit felt that the officers had    plenty of time to obtain a search warrant before entering the hotel room. Furthermore,    the court did not find that there was any emergency that would justify entry    without a search warrant. The court stated that sim ply    because there is probable cause to believe a serious crime is being committed    or that there is the mere possibility that evidence could be destroyed does    not mean there is an emergency that would justify entry without a warrant. While    the court found that entry was not justified by an emergency, it ruled that,    instead, the entry was justified based upon the initial consent given to the    undercover officer to enter. The consent given to the first entry was not broken    by the undercover officer’s brief exit to obtain assistance to arrest the    suspect. The court opined that based on the evidence the   suspect    would have likely admitted the undercover agent back into the hotel room and    the fact that the agent was assisted by other law enforcement officers did not    make a difference.            It    is not required that the undercover officer actually return with the arrest    team for the consent given to him to be transferred to the arrest team. For    example, in  United    States v. Santiago , 29     an informant went inside a suspect’s apartment purportedly to buy a kilogram    of cocaine. Upon examining the cocaine package, the informant told the suspects    that he needed to leave to retrieve the money for the purchase of the cocaine    from his “moneyman.” The informant then went out to his car and informed    the federal agents on the arrest team about his observations. Approximately    15 minutes later, the arrest team, unaccompanied by the informant, used a battering    ram to enter the apartment without a search or arrest warrant. The agents arrested    the suspects, who gave the agents consent to search the apartment. Upon searching    the apartment, the agents found and seized the kilogram of cocaine that the    informant had previously examined. The suspects moved to suppress the evidence    by contending that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated when the federal    agents entered their home without a warrant, their voluntary consent, or exigent    circumstances. The court found that there was no emergency that justified an    immediate entry without a warrant. The court ruled, however, that the second    entry by the arrest team was justified by the earlier consent to enter obtained    by the informant. The  Santiago     court   decided    that the 15-minute delay in the entry of the arrest team was not too long to    put it outside the immediacy requirement of the consent once removed doctrine: 30           The facts      suggest that the [informant] and federal agents acted diligently in effecting      the arrests and seizing the contraband. As described by the government prosecutor      and agreed to by the defendants in open court, the length of time that elapsed      was that necessary for the [informant] to return to his car and summon assistance      and for the agents to gather in the parking lot, proceed up to the apartment,      and enter using the battering ram. Their actions after the [informant] established      probable cause essentially constituted an unbroken chain of events, and the      arrests were executed without interruption or significant loss of time. 31               Undercover    Officer Not Expected To Return            Most    courts do not require that the undercover officer create an expectation that    he will return for the arrest team to reenter on the authority of the original    consent given to the undercover officer. For example, in  United    States v. McDonald , 32     an undercover agent with the New York Drug Enforcement Task Force was admitted    to a one-room efficiency apartment on the first floor of an apartment building    shortly before 10 p.m. on September 8, 1988. The agent encountered a suspect    sitting in a chair pointing a cocked 9-mm semiautomatic pistol at the floor    but   in    his direction. Another suspect, Errol McDonald, was sitting on a couch counting    a stack of money within easy reach of a .357-magnum revolver. There were four    other men in the apartment. The agent bought a small amount of marijuana and    left the building. Shortly thereafter, the agent returned to the apartment with    reinforcements and knocked on the door. As soon as the agents identified themselves,    they heard the sound of scuffling feet and received   simultaneous    radio communication from the perimeter team informing them that the occupants    were attempting to escape through a bathroom window. The agents then used a    battering ram to enter the apartment. The agents arrested the suspects and found    large quantities of cocaine and marijuana along with two loaded weapons, drug    paraphernalia, drug packaging materials, and several thousand dollars in cash.             In    an opinion of the full bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,    the  McDonald     court    ruled:            [T]here    is no doubt that the agent who made the undercover purchase would have been    entitled to arrest the suspects in the apartment at the time of the purchase.    A controlled purchase of narcotics by an undercover law enforcement agent ‘is    a recognized and permissible means of investigation’ employed to gather    evidence of illegal conduct and to make lawful arrests.... It follows that the    undercover agent here did not need a warrant to reenter the apartment within    10 minutes, having exited only to secure proper protection by obtaining reinforcements.    This is not the kind of scenario that needs the detached judgment of a neutral    magistrate to determine whether there is probable cause for an arrest and search. 33       That    same reasoning was apparent in  State    v. Henry . 34     In  Henry,     an    undercover officer made a purchase of crack cocaine from suspects inside an    apartment. The undercover officer exited the apartment and informed the waiting    arrest team what had taken place. Approximately 15 to 20 minutes later, the    backup detectives knocked on the door of the apartment. As soon as the door    was opened, the officers announced themselves and one of the suspects fled into    a bedroom, with two of the detectives in pursuit. The suspects were arrested    and the illegal drugs were found on the suspects during a search incident to    arrest. The Supreme Court of New Jersey ruled that once the undercover detective    observed the   commission    of a crime in his presence, he had both statutory and common law authority to    arrest the defendant on the spot. The defendant contended that once the undercover    officer left the apartment without making an arrest, he easily could have obtained    an arrest warrant and therefore, was constitutionally obligated to do so. The     Henry     court disagreed with the defendant and stated that it does not follow that an    otherwise legal war-rantless arrest becomes illegal simply because the officers    could have, but did not, obtain an arrest warrant. 35       The    more significant issue in  Henry     was not the warrantless arrest of the suspects but the warrant-less entry of    the apartment by the arrest team. The court ruled that the second entry into    the apartment by the police to effectuate the arrest was reasonable because    the undercover officer was earlier given consent to enter, and the probable    cause that the undercover officer had to arrest the suspects had not dissipated    in the short 15 to 20 minutes between the time he left and the second entry    by the arrest team. The court concluded that there was no need for the officers    to seek the detached review of a magistrate before entering the apartment to    arrest the suspects. The court summarized the basis for its ruling thusly:        Here, the      separate entries can be viewed as components of a single, continuous, and      integrated police action and were not interrupted or separated by an unduly      prolonged delay... ultimately we are convinced of the reasonableness of the      warrantless entry in light of all the circumstances surrounding the entry.      Those circumstances include the consensual basis for the initial entry, probable      cause for an immediate arrest arising out of that entry, the short amount      of time and continuity between the two entries, and the legitimate grounds      for delaying the initial arrest until backup officers could arrive. 36            Scope    of Consent            When    making an entry under the consent once removed doctrine, the backup officers    are restricted to the scope of the consent originally granted to the undercover    officer or informant. 37     The backup officers are not authorized under this doctrine to go beyond those    areas that the suspect gave consent to the undercover officer to enter. 38     To expand the search area beyond the original consent given to the undercover    officer, the officers must obtain a search warrant, obtain new expanded consent    from the resident, or apply one of the other exceptions to the search warrant    requirement. For example, when   placing    someone under arrest the officers could search the subject and the immediate    area surrounding that subject incident to arrest. The justification for the    search would not be the consent given by the suspect to the undercover officer    during the original entry, but, rather, the search incident to arrest exception    to the search warrant requirement. 39        Conclusion             Officers    may, without a search warrant or an emergency, enter the premises of a suspect    if: 1) an informant or undercover officer has previously entered at the invitation    of someone with authority to give consent; 2) the informant or undercover officer    establishes probable cause to arrest or search while inside the premises; or    3) the informant or undercover officer immediately summons help from the other    officers. This doctrine, commonly referred to as “consent once removed,”    allows officers to rely on the authority of the original consent given to the    undercover officer as justification to make the second entry.

Santana, 427 U.S. 38 (1976).    12 Id.    13 Oftentimes in drug cases, there is an emergency after making a controlled    purchase of drugs. Some courts allow officers to reenter a residence without    a warrant, based on the emergency; they do not base their decision on the initial    consent given to the undercover officers. Those courts reason that once the    illegal drug transaction begins to unfold any delay in obtaining a warrant would    permit the destruction of evidence, the escape of suspects, or increase the    danger to officers or others. See    United States v. Harris, 713 F.2d 623 (11th Cir. 1983); United States v. Bradley,    455 F.2d 1181 (1st Cir. 1972).        14 Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973).

The suspect’s knowledge    of his right to refuse consent is only one factor for a court to consider when    deciding whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the consent was voluntary.

A government agent, in the same manner as a private person,    may accept an invitation to do business and may enter upon the premises for    the very purposes contemplated by the occupant. Of course, this does not    mean that, whenever entry is obtained by invitation and the locus is characterized    as a place of business, an    agent is authorized to conduct a general search for incriminating materials.”).   16 United States v.

At best, the record suggests that defendant did not expressly    invite Adams to his trailer for the purpose of conducting a drug transaction.    Defendant had no previous arrangements with Adams regarding any drug buys. Defendant    was highly intoxicated at the time, vitiating any alleged consent given to Adams.    Secondly, Adams, in his initial entry, did not establish probable cause to believe    that cocaine was located inside the trailer. Defendant did not display any cocaine    to Adams, nor did defendant arrange to make a future sale to Adams. Having failed    to meet two out of the three elements, a warrantless search of defendant’s    trailer could not be    sustained under this doctrine.”).        19 103 F.3d 1475 (9th Cir. 1996).        20 215 F.3d 643 (6th Cir. 2000).        21 794 F. Supp. 178 (E.D. Va. 1982).        22 In State v. Johnston, 518 N.W.2d 759 (Wis. 1994), the Supreme Court of Wisconsin    found that it was confusing and unnecessary to resort to the doctrine of consent    once removed. The court reasoned that if an officer has probable cause to arrest    a suspect he may summon backup officers to enter premises without a warrant    to assist him. The court further ruled that “there is no rule that back-up    or assistance may be had only when there are exigent circumstances. Time does    not need to be ‘of the essence’ and the officers certainly do not    need to be in an emergency or in mortal danger before we will allow back-up    and    assistance.” Id. at 766. See also United States v. Ryles, 451 F.2d 190    (3rd Cir. 1971), wherein the informant exited the defendant’s apartment    after witnessing the defendant mixing narcotics on the kitchen table. The informant    signaled officers waiting outside, who immediately entered and arrested the    defendant. The Ryles court ruled that the trial court properly denied    the defendant’s motion to suppress. No mention was made in the case of    the doctrine of consent once removed. The Ryles court instead based its decision    on the reasoning in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Lewis v. United States, 385    U.S.206, 211 (1966), which it quoted: “when, as here, the home is converted    into a commercial center to which outsiders are invited for purposes of transacting    unlawful business, that business is entitled to no greater sanctity than if    it were carried on in a store, a garage, a car, or    on the street.” Id at 191.        23 19 F.3d 296 (7th Cir. 1994).

Ill. 1995) (“The    charges against Jones resulted from a ‘reverse buy’ undercover DEA    investigation. Through a cooperating individual and his girlfriend, a cocaine    deal was arranged whereby Jones agreed to pay $60,000 for two kilograms of cocaine.    At Jones’ instruction, the transaction was to be carried out    at his father’s house. When the cooperating girlfriend arrived, Jones placed    a bag containing $60,000 in front of her, signalling his    willingness to complete the transaction. The girlfriend then left the house    for the purported purpose of retrieving the cocaine. An arrest signal was given    and DEA agents who were waiting outside entered the house.” The Jones court    ruled that the entry by the agents was lawful under the consent once removed    doctrine.). But see United States v. Ogbuh, 982 F.2d 1000, 1004-05 (6th Cir.    1993). In Ogbuh, a suspect was stopped by DEA agents and found to possess approximately    51.73 grams of heroin. The suspect decided to cooperate with DEA and make a    controlled delivery of the heroin. The agents replaced most of the heroin    with sham and had the suspect, who was now acting as a DEA informant, make a    controlled delivery of the package to his accomplices in a hotel room. Within    a minute of the informant’s entry into the hotel room, the arrest team    forcibly entered the room. By the time the agents entered, one suspect and the    informant had already flushed the sham/drug mixture down the toilet. The court    ruled that the entry was not justified under the emergency exception and, because    the informant did not summon the officers, the second entry could not be based    upon the consent to enter given to the informant. The U.S. Court of Appeals    for the    Sixth Circuit adopted the consent once removed doctrine in United States v.    Pollard, 215 F.3d 643, 648 (6th Cir. 2000). The Pollard court cited, but did    not overrule Ogbuh.         27 660 F.2d 1178 (7th Cir. 1981).        28 814 F.2d 454 (7th Cir. 1987). See also Lawrence v. State, 388 So.2d 1250,    1253 (Fla.

Ill. 2002) (The    informant saw cocaine in an apartment as he    negotiated for the purchase of the cocaine. The informant exited the apartment    and told the waiting arrest team what he saw. The informant drove away, and,    within 2 minutes after the informant exited the apartment, the arrest team forced    entry into the apartment and arrested the defendant. The court ruled that the    consent once removed doctrine was inapplicable because the    entry of the arrest team was not immediate. The Herrera-Corral court disagreed    with the Santiago court that the 15-minute delay    between the exit of the informant and the second entry by the arrest team in    the Santiago case constituted an immediate entry. The    Herrera-Corral court further questioned whether simply telling the agents what    he saw inside the apartment was sufficient to constitute “summoning”    the agents as required by the consent once removed doctrine.).        31 Id.        32 916 F.2d 766 (2d Cir. 1990) (en banc), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1119 (1991).        33 Id. at 771 (citing Arkansas v.

The McDonald court further ruled that the agents did    not impermissibly create an emergency by knocking and announcing their presence    because it was lawful for the police to    do that. The court gave yet another basis that the entry was lawful by stating    that, regardless of the announcement by the officers at the door, they were    faced with an emergency as soon as the undercover agent made the drug purchase.    “First, the ongoing sale and distribution of narcotics constituted a grave    offense. Second, the defendant and at least one of his associates were armed    with loaded, semi-automatic weapons. Third, the law enforcement agents had not    only probable cause to suspect that a crime had been perpetrated but firsthand    knowledge that ongoing crimes were transpiring. Fourth, the agents further knew    that the defendant and his associates were in the apartment. Fifth, the likelihood    that a suspect might escape if not swiftly apprehended was    confirmed by the fact that the man who actually made the sale to Agent Agee    had apparently escaped during the 10-minute interval that elapsed after the    controlled purchase and before the agents entered the apartment. Sixth, the    agents acted in accordance with the law, and first attempted to effect a peaceful    entry by knocking and announcing themselves.” 916 F.2d at 770 (quoting    Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 298 (1967), and McDonald v. United States, 335    U.S. 451, 456 (1948)). The    McDonald court listed two other considerations as relevant to its decision.    “[T]he volatile mix of drug sales, loaded weapons and likely drug abuse    presented a clear and immediate danger to the law enforcement agents and the    public at large.... In addition,...the agents were confronted by an urgent need    to prevent the possible loss of evidence....” Id. at 770. See also    Minnesota v.

Bramble, 103 F.3d 1475 (9th Cir. 1996).        39 Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 763 (1969). The U. S. Supreme Court has    ruled that “[a] custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is    a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful,    a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.”    United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973). Police have the automatic authority    to search a person incident to a lawful arrest and need not establish the probability    that weapons or evidence would be    found prior to instituting the search. Id. at 236. An officer may perform a    search of the person and may open any object found during such a search. Chimel,    395 U.S. 752, 763. “While the legal arrest of a person should not destroy    the    privacy of his premises, it does—for at least a reasonable time and to    a reasonable extent— take his own privacy out of protection from police    interest in weapons, means of escape, and evidence.” United States v. Edwards,    415 U.S. 800, 808 (1974). The Supreme Court has limited the spatial scope of    a search incident to arrest. A search incident to arrest must be    confined to the area within the immediate control of the arrestee. Chimel, 395    U.S. at 763. The Court reasoned that the search must be confined to that area    within which the arrestee could gain possession of a weapon or destroy evidence.    Id.

Locating    the vehicle,  Deputy      Esch     attempted    to make a  traffic      contact     when    the vehicle, traveling      almost     80    mph, ran off the road .      The     vehicle    reached a ditch,      became     airborne,    and struck the      guide      wire     of    a utility pole. Fire  engulfed      the        vehicle    and trapped the driver inside .      Deputy      Esch      used     a fire extinguisher to put out the  flames      in      the     cab,    but was unable to open either  door .     Officers      Pete      Bratton    and Tim Young of the Greeley,      Colorado,     Police    Department arrived. Officer  Bratton      kept      the      flames    at bay with a fire extinguisher  while      Deputy     Esch    and Officer Young pulled the  driver      from      the      vehicle .    The driver suffered second- and  third - degree     burns    on 10 percent of his upper body      and      face .     Deputy     Esch and Officers Bratton and Young      exhibited     bravery    and a willingness to put their      lives      in      danger      and     subsequently saved the life of the  driver .                    Officer    Scott  Provost      of      the      Bellingham,     Massachusetts, Police Department responded to a call of      a      fire      alarm      in      an      apartment    building. Upon arrival at the scene, Officer Provost      entered      the      upstairs     apartment, but was overcome by thick smoke. While  regaining      his      composure     outside the apartment, Officer Provost spoke with a      group      of      tenants      from    a downstairs apartment. He was informed that a mother      and      two      young      children    were in the upstairs apartment .     After    being instructed      exactly      where      the      children’s    bedroom was located, Officer Provost reentered      the      apartment .     He discovered that the mother had  left     a suicide    note and had      placed      puddles      of     accelerate throughout the apartment. She also had barricaded      the      door      of      the      children’s    room and crawled into bed with them. Officer  Provost      was      able      to      kick    open the bedroom door enough to squeeze through the  opening .      Once      inside     the bedroom, he was able to confront the mother and evacuate everyone from the      fire .      Officer Provost    put his own life in peril by entering the burning apartment, and, by doing so,    he saved the lives of three people.

GX020-88-6480395	DEBRA W. YANG   United States Attorney  Central District of California      Thom Mrozek, Public Affairs Officer  (213) 894-6947  thom.mrozek@usdoj.gov   September 23, 2002     FULLERTON MAN SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS  IN $17 MILLION PYRAMID SCHEME   A con man who falsely claimed to have an MBA degree from the University of Southern California and to have worked as a director for a major Japanese brokerage firm was sentenced today to 10 years in federal prison for operating a $17 million securities fraud scheme.   Scott K. Yoshizumi was sentenced this afternoon in federal court in connection with a bogus investment scheme in which he defrauded more than 100 investors out of $17 million in just one year.   Yoshizumi, 41, who maintained residences in Fullerton and Lakewood, was indicted on April 24, 2001, for running a fraudulent scheme out of a Cerritos-based company named Concord Capital, Inc. (CCI). During a year that began in November 1999, CCI offered bogus investments in what it claimed to be “letters of credit” from foreign banks. As part of the scheme, Yoshizumi met with investors and promised them returns of 24 percent to 48 percent per year.   Yoshizumi falsely told investors that he had an MBA degree from USC and that he had served as a director of Nomura Securities for 13 years. In fact, during the period of time he claimed that he worked for Nomura, he had been in federal prison on two separate federal mail and wire fraud convictions. Yoshizumi told investors that he had special relationships with foreign banks from which he bought letters of credit and that he then resold for a higher amount. He told investors that their investments would be held in segregated accounts and used only for the letter of credit investments. He claimed that the high rates of return would come with virtually no risk.   In fact, Yoshizumi never purchased any “letters of credit” with investor funds and never kept any funds in escrow. Instead, Yoshizumi operated a Ponzi scheme in which he made monthly payments to some investors from the money he received from new investors and used much of the money for his own benefit. In particular, Yoshizumi used $1.3 million of the money to purchase a house in Fullerton, where he was living when arrested. He used another $400,000 to buy a house in Grover Beach, and nearly a quarter million dollars to purchase a condominium in Laguna Niguel. He used over $500,000 to pay for 15 cars, including three Mercedes Benzs, two Lexus cars and two BMWs. Still more money went to trips, landscaping, decorating and home renovations.   On October 10, 2001, Yoshizumi pleaded guilty before United States District Judge Audrey B. Collins to two counts of securities fraud, and one count each of mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.   Judge Collins sentenced Yoshizumi this afternoon to 120 months after determining that Yoshizumi was not entitled to a reduced sentence for “acceptance of responsibility.” In a plea agreement filed in court last year, the government agreed to recommend a sentence of 92 months, this under the assumption that Yoshizumi received credit for accepting his responsibility by pleading guilty. However, after he pleaded guilty in October 2001, Yoshizumi dismissed two successive lawyers because of conflicts with them. Yoshizumi then filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that he “lacked criminal intent” to commit his crimes.   A court-appointed receiver has recovered over $4 million for Yoshizumi’s investors, and, as a result of today’s sentencing, Yoshizumi owes them more than $13 million in restitution.   “This case should serve as a reminder to potential investors that if the interest rates sounds too good to be true, it is probably not true,” said Ronald Iden, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI. “This sentence should also serve as a warning to other financial predators that if you engage in this kind of egregious investor fraud scheme, you will spend a substantial part of your life behind bars.”   This matter was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which received substantial assistance from the Pacific Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Release No. 02-138    Return to the   2002 Press Release Index.

GX024-22-10792525	"December 5, 2003     OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY   SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA   San Diego, California        United States Attorney   Carol C. Lam           For Further Information, Contact: Assistant U. S. Attorney Sanjay Bhandari, 619-557-7042 or Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin J. Kelly, 619-557-6216       For Immediate Release     NEWS RELEASE SUMMARY       United States Attorney Carol C. Lam today announced the entry of the seventh guilty plea resulting from the continuing federal criminal investigation of PinnFund, U.S.A., Inc. (""PinnFund"").     PinnFund was a Carlsbad-based mortgage lender closed down by court order on March 23, 2001 upon application of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").  Investigation by a court-appointed receiver, in conjunction with the SEC, revealed that PinnFund had operated as a massive Ponzi scheme, resulting in losses of over $200 million by hundreds of investors.     Today, defendant TOMMY A. LARSEN, former president of PinnLease, Inc., a PinnFund subsidiary,  pled guilty before Magistrate Judge Leo S. Papas - without a plea agreement - to crimes arising out of his role in the PinnFund fraud.  More specifically, LARSEN pled guilty to scheming to obtain funds for PinnFund through fraudulent equipment leases and laundering kickbacks of those funds to PinnFund and himself through sham transactions and false invoices.  LARSEN also pled guilty to obstruction of justice stemming from his previous attempt to provide false testimony in a federal district court.  Finally, he pled guilty to evading taxes with respect to his 1999 and 2000 federal income taxes by charging personal expenditures to PinnFund, by structuring his compensation to avoid payroll taxes, and by hiding the proceeds of illicit activity in offshore financial institutions.  Acceptance of the plea and sentencing are scheduled before the Honorable Marilyn L. Huff on April 5, 2004, at 9:00 a.m.     United States Attorney Carol C. Lam commented, ""Today's guilty plea demonstrates the extraordinary scope of the fraudulent conduct that occurred at PinnFund.  This office is committed to investigating and prosecuting these massive fraudulent schemes no matter how complex.""     Denise L. Rubin, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge for San Diego, stated, ""The personal greed of those responsible for the massive PinnFund fraud led to the collapse of the corporation, the loss of millions of dollars by investors, and the evasion of taxes.  LARSEN diverted funds from the fraudulent leasing scheme for his personal use and hid these funds in an offshore bank account he controlled.  IRS Criminal Investigation will continue to aggressively pursue those individuals involved in corporate fraud.""     Daniel Dzwilewski, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge said, ""Leasing fraud is a nationwide problem involving losses in millions of dollars.  Today's guilty plea is an inroad to addressing this type of fraud and is an example of how perpetrators will be vigorously investigated and prosecuted.""     This case is the result of a joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation.

GX253-82-3161303	"OLR Amended Bill Analysis    sHB 5059 (as amended by House ""A"")*    AN ACT CONCERNING HUNTING SAFETY.    SUMMARY :    This bill creates the crimes of negligent hunting and hunting while under the influence or impaired.  It imposes enhanced penalties for persistent offenders. It generally requires the person arrested for these crimes to surrender his weapon.    By law, a hunter whose license has been suspended for violation of hunting laws must complete a remedial hunter education course designed by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) before his license can be reinstated.  The bill additionally requires the hunter to demonstrate that he has passed a conservation education/firearms safety course or its equivalent, as specified by DEP.    * House Amendment ""A""  broadened the definition of negligent hunting in the third degree.         EFFECTIVE DATE:  October 1, 2000    NEGLIGENT HUNTING    The bill establishes four degrees of negligent hunting.  Hunting is:    1. pursuing, shooting, killing, and capturing a bird, four-legged animal, or reptile, or trying to do these things, whether or not this results in taking the animal or    2. any act of assistance in taking or attempting to take such an animal.    The bill establishes, as  prima facie  evidence that someone was hunting, his possession of a loaded hunting weapon while at, entering, or leaving an area where a reasonable person would believe the objective was to take wildlife.      But, the bill allows a person to possess a loaded long gun one hour before sunrise during deer and turkey firearms season if it does not have a live round in it.    A loaded hunting weapon is:    1. a long gun with a live round in the chamber or in a magazine attached to the gun,    2. a muzzle-loaded gun with a percussion cap in place,    3. a flintlock firearm with powder in the pan,    4. a bow with an arrow notched on it,    5. a drawn crossbow with a bolt in place, or    6. a high velocity air gun charged with a projectile in the chamber or in an attached magazine.    First Degree    A person is guilty of negligent hunting in the first degree when, with criminal negligence, he shoots a loaded hunting weapon and kills someone while hunting. Criminal negligence means failing to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result or circumstance described in a statute will occur.      Negligent hunting is a class D felony subject to imprisonment of one to five years, of which one year may not be suspended or reduced, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license indefinitely.    Second Degree    A person is guilty of this crime when, with criminal negligence, he (1) violates the law against jacklighting for deer or (2) shoots a loaded hunting weapon and causes serious physical injury to another person.  A serious physical injury is one that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes serious (1) disfigurement, (2) impairment of health, or (3) loss or impairment of a bodly organ's function.  The offense is a class A misdemeanor. The offender must be fined between $400 and $2,000 and can be imprisoned for up to one year.  In addition, DEP can suspend his license for up to 10 years.    Third Degree    A person is guilty of this crime if he, while hunting:    1. fires a loaded hunting weapon at a time of day when hunting is prohibited;     2. hunts on Sundays, or outside of hunting season;    3. shoots a firearm from a vehicle;    4. hunts with a suspended license; or    5. discharges a firearm into a building occupied by people or domestic animals or used to store flammable or combustible material.    This crime is a class B misdemeanor.  The hunter must be fined $200 to $1,000 and can be imprisoned up to six months. In addition, DEP can suspend his license for up to five years.    Fourth Degree    A person is guilty of this crime if he, while hunting:    1. hunts without buying the license, permit, or stamp required by law;    2. possesses a loaded hunting weapon during a time of day when hunting is prohibited;    3. hunts from or fires a hunting weapon across a public highway.    A person is also guilty of this crime if he hunts with or fires a firearm within (1) 250 feet of building occupied by people or domestic animals or used to store flammable or combustible material or (2) 125 feet of any of these buildings while hunting in tidal water.  This provision does not apply if the hunter is carrying the written authorization of the building's owner.     The crime is a class C misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to three months, a fine of up to $500, or both.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license for up to three years.    Allocation of Fines    Under the bill, fines for first-and second-degree negligent hunting go to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.  Fines for third-and fourth-degree negligent hunting go to the Conservation Fund for land management or acquisition of hunting easements.    HUNTING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OR IMPAIRED    Elements of the Crime    The bill prohibits hunting while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs.  A person is considered impaired if his blood alcohol content at the time of the offense was .07%to .10%.  A person is considered under the influence if his blood alcohol content is above .10%.  If he has been previously convicted of hunting under the influence the threshold is .07%. A person can also be found to be under the influence independent of his BAC.     The bill allows DEP enforcement officers to arrest people for this crime.    Alcohol Testing Procedures    The bill extends the laws regarding alcohol tests that currently apply to drunk boating to hunting while under the influence or while impaired.  The law requires the arresting officer to determine whether to give a blood, breath, or urine test; if the person is unwilling or unable to submit to a blood test, the officer must designate a breath or urine test.  If the person refuses to submit to the test, none is administered.  The refusal to submit to a test is admissible in court if the person was (1) placed under arrest, (2) informed of his constitutional rights, (3) given an opportunity to call a lawyer, and (4) informed that refusal is admissible and can be used against him.      Admissibility of Test Results    As under the boating laws, the test results are admissible if:    1. the hunter was given a chance to call a lawyer and submitted to the test;    2. a true copy of the test result was mailed or delivered to the defendant within 24 hours or the end of the next business day after the result is known, whichever is later;    3. the test was performed by or at the direction of a law enforcement officer, using methods and equipment approved by the Department of Public Health (DPH);    4. the test was performed by a person certified for this purpose by DPH or recertified by a DPH-certified instructor;    5. any blood sample was taken by a medical professional with specified credentials;    6. the testing device was checked for accuracy by a DPH-certified person at the beginning and by the end of the workday; and    7. evidence is presented that demonstrates that the BAC at the time of the test accurately reflected the BAC at the time of the alleged offense.    In addition, a second test of the same type must be administered at least 30 minutes after the first test and the testing device was checked for accuracy by DPH-certified person. But the results of the first test can be admitted if reasonable efforts were made to conduct the second test even if the second test was not performed, was not performed within a reasonable time, or fails to meet the other criteria.    Penalties    Violation of the bill's drunk hunting provisions is a class A misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for up to one year, a fine of up to $2,000, or both.  The fines go to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license indefinitely.    PERSISTENT OFFENDERS    Under the bill, a person convicted of (1) negligent hunting in the first, second, or third degree or (2) hunting while impaired or under the influence within five years of a conviction of negligent hunting is considered a persistent negligent hunter. A persistent negligent hunter must be fined at least twice the minimum provided for the second violation, that is, $400 for a conviction of negligent hunting in third degree and $800 for a conviction of negligent hunting in the second degree.  The hunter is also subject to the penalties for the next, more serious degree of negligent hunting or hunting while impaired or under the influence.  The provision has no effect with regard to the drunk hunting crimes, since they have only one degree and no minimum fine.  It appears that any fine imposed on a persistent offender would go to the General Fund.    SURRENDER OF WEAPON    The bill requires anyone arrested for negligent hunting in the first, second, or third degree or hunting under the influence or impaired to surrender any weapon in his possession.  The police or conservation officer must confiscate the weapon at the time of the arrest.  If the hunter is acquitted or the charge is dismissed or nolled, the weapon must be returned in the same condition as when it was confiscated.    If the hunter is convicted, the weapon must turned over to DEP.  DEP can (1) retain the weapon for agency use; (2) convey it to the Department of Administrative Services for sale at auction, with the proceeds going to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund; or (3) destroy it.    These provisions to not apply to weapons used to jacklight deer, which are already subject to separate disposition procedures.

GX030-84-15346398	[Skip Navigation]     [Text & Graphics]    [Home]    [Search & Site Map]                            ICE News Release   January 30, 2003    INS Dismantles Major Immigration  Document Fraud Scheme    Ringleader gets 8 years, eight other vendors in jail, and 4 new indictments  arise from a related investigation      Chicago, IL   Brian R. Perryman, District Director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in Chicago, together with Patrick J. Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, announced the sentencing January 29 of two Mexican nationals for their roles in a conspiracy to provide false identity documents to illegal aliens in Chicago. They are the last of nine defendants to be sentenced under Operation Mega, an investigation initiated by INS in December 2000 and supported by the Social Security Administration (SSA) into a $500,000 a year counterfeit document ring for illegal aliens that operated at the Mega Mall, a discount shopping center located at 2500 N. Milwaukee Avenue on Chicagos northwest side.     Yesterday U.S. District Court Judge James B. Zagel imposed an 8-year sentence on  Aaron Mena-Perez , age 38 and an illegal alien from Mexico residing in Chicago, after determining that he was the leader of the document ring.  Mena-Perez  is also required to pay a $600.00 fine and received an additional sentence of 24 months for re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation. Judge Zagel also sentenced co-defendant  Eduardo Javier Acosta-Rios , age 31, also an illegal alien from Mexico, to 27 months in prison.     In May 2001 a search warrant resulted in the seizure of 2,718 counterfeit green cards and social security cards. It was determined that ringleader  Mena-Perez  received a $50.00 cut from every set of documents sold, earning him approximately $384,000.00 annually. Counterfeit identity documents sell on the street for between $80 and $120 per set, which includes a fake social security card and green card, and are routinely manufactured and sold to illegal aliens who use them to gain unlawful employment.     Mena-Perez  and  Acosta-Rios  will be surrendered to the INS upon completion of their criminal sentences to be placed into INS custody for deportation proceedings.    Operation Mega led to the initiation of an offshoot investigation into another counterfeit document ring operating at the Mega Mall. This 8-month investigation began on January 9, 2002 and continued through August 2002. On January 27, 2003, INS arrested four individuals for producing and selling fraudulent documents.  Taurino Armando Brito-Sotelo , age 35, an illegal alien from Mexico who was previously deported;  Augustina Segura-Flores , age 55, an illegal alien from Mexico;  Mario Sinchi-Chacho , age 34, an illegal alien from Ecuador; and  Rodolfo Coronel-Ortiz , age 38, a legal permanent resident from Mexico, were indicted for their roles in allegedly operating a fraudulent document ring. As part of the conspiracy, the documents were produced at various locations in Chicago, including 2953 W. Fullerton and 1338 W. 18th Place, transported back to the Mega Mall, and sold to illegal aliens, according to the indictment.      The INS has a very active unit that is investigating illegal document manufacturers and vendors, says INS District Director Perryman. We will not tolerate this type of identity fraud to be committed in our communities by persons who seek to conceal the identity of foreign nationals here illegally. This kind of criminal activity is a direct threat to the homeland security of this area and this country.    The new indictment contains only charges and is not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent and are entitled to a fair trial at which the United States has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.     ###                             Last Modified 10/03/2003                        ABOUT           |  NEWS ROOM  |  ENFORCEMENT  |  CAREERS            Threat Level  |  Home  |  Text  |  Site Map  |  Search  |  FOIA  |  Legal  |  Firstgov |  DHS

Using Virginia’s new   Anti-Spam law, Kilgore’s Office has now indicted and charged two criminal spammers,   including one regarded as the eighth-worst spam distributor in the world. The new law,   authored by Kilgore earlier this year, is considered the toughest in the nation and was   used as the model for the criminal portion of the federal legislation.      ""I am pleased that Mr. Rutowski has turned himself into authorities   in North Carolina,"" Kilgore said. ""Spam has a direct, negative impact on the   efficiency and effectiveness of the free enterprise system and day-to-day operations of   business. Mr. Rutowski is a part of this problem.""     ""We want to send a clear message that fraudulently sent spam will   not be tolerated in Virginia,"" Kilgore added.     Richard Rutowski, of Cary, North Carolina, is a co-conspirator of Jeremy   Jaynes (aka: ""Jeremy James"" and ""Gaven Stubberfield"") who was arrested   yesterday in Raleigh, North Carolina. Both are charged with four felony counts of using   fraudulent means to transmit unsolicited bulk e-mail in violation of Virginia’s   Anti-Spam law, which allows for prosecution in Virginia if any part of the illegal   transactions take place in any locality in the Commonwealth. Extradition procedures are   underway to return the two for prosecution in Loudoun County, Virginia, where the grand   jury indicted them on Monday. ""Gaven Stubberfield"" is listed as the eighth-most   prolific spammer by the Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO) available on the spam   information website  www.spamhaus.com . The two each   face four felony charges, each of which carries punishment of one- to five-years in   prison, a fine of up to $2,500, or both.      The indictments allege that spam was sent between July 11, 2003   and August 9, 2003 through servers located in Virginia. Specifically, spam sent on July   16, 19 and 26 exceeded 10,000 messages during each 24-hour period. Additionally, spam   messages in excess of 100,000 were sent during the 30-day period between July 11 and   August 11. These numbers do not reflect the total number of messages sent, as they are   based solely on actual complaints received by Internet Service Providers from their   customers. The indictments also allege that the senders falsified transmission or routing   information to prevent recipients from knowing who sent the messages and how to contact   the sender.     The investigation was initiated by the Attorney General’s Computer   Crime Unit in August with the assistance of the investigative arms of various Internet   Service Providers. The investigation followed three routes: the domain names in the   e-mails, the ISPs in the e-mails and the internet connections. Kilgore declined to provide   further details of the investigation, citing the coming felony prosecutions.     Kilgore’s anti-spam law, sponsored in the 2003 General Assembly by   Del. Jeannemarie Devolites (Vienna) and Sen. Ken Stolle (Virginia Beach), prohibits the   sending of unsolicited bulk e-mails by fraudulent means, such as changing the header or   routing information to prevent recipients from contacting or knowing the identity of the   sender. Such activity is punishable as a class 1 misdemeanor, or as a class 6 felony if   any one of the following conditions applies:               The volume of spam transmitted exceeds 10,000 in any 24-hour time period,         100,000 in any 30-day time period, or one million in any one-year time period.                             Revenue generated from specific spam exceeds $1,000 or total revenue from         all spam transmitted to any ISP exceeds $50,000.                             The defendant knowingly hires, employs, uses or permits any minor to         assist in the transition of spam.               A class 6 felony is punishable by a one- to five-year prison sentence   and a fine of up to $2,500 or both. The legislation also includes asset forfeiture   provisions to allow law enforcement authorities to seize any assets or proceeds obtained   through the illegal spam operation. It also enhances penalties for violation of Virginia   obscenity laws through the sending of illegal e-mails. The legislation authorizes the   Attorney General’s Computer Crime Unit to investigate and prosecute spammers if   illegal e-mails are sent to, from, or through any computer or computer network located in   any Virginia locality.      -30-                  Back to Press Release main page"

Last week, Jeremy Jaynes (aka: ""Jeremy James"" and ""Gaven   Stubberfield""), of Raleigh, North Carolina, and his co-conspirator, Richard   Rutkowski, of Cary, North Carolina, were indicted and charged with four felony counts of   using fraudulent means to transmit unsolicited bulk e-mail in violation of Virginia’s   Anti-Spam law, which allows for prosecution in Virginia if any part of the illegal   transactions take place in any locality in the Commonwealth. ""Gaven   Stubberfield"" is listed as the eighth-most prolific spammer by the Register of Known   Spam Operations (ROKSO) available on the spam information website  www.spamhaus.com . The two each face four felony   charges, each of which carries punishment of one- to five-years in prison, a fine of up to   $2,500, or both.     The investigation was initiated by the Attorney General’s Computer   Crime Unit in August with the assistance of the investigative arms of various Internet   Service Providers.            -30-                  Back to Press Release main page"

Barton                 Coordinator, Anti-Terrorism Task Force, District of South Carolina                 Perhaps the most burning question among law enforcement officials                these days is whether your town or city could be a target for a                terrorist attack. Some argue not likely, since an attack on Washington,                D.C., or some more populous location or national symbol, would more                effectively terrorize the country, which is the goal of such attack.                But that mind set could make us even more vulnerable because if                we let down our guard, we become an easy target, and an easy target                is a vulnerable target. While another attack in New York City or                Washington would certainly be devastating, an attack in an unlikely                place would send the message that nowhere is safe, which in many                ways would be even worse.                                So what can we do? What should the officer on the street be looking                for that might be an indication of possible terrorist activity?                Certain things that point to a possible target are readily apparent,                like thefts of explosives or precursor chemicals, thefts of firearms                or ammunition, or suspicious people with an unusual interest in                potential targets such as power plants, water treatment facilities,                and military installations. But there are other less obvious activities                we should watch for as well, take for example what occurred in North                Carolina. The US Attorney's Office in Charlotte recently prosecuted                24 defendants for a variety of federal crimes, including bank fraud,                credit card fraud, trafficking in untaxed cigarettes, and conspiracy                to violate INS laws. What did that have to do with terrorism? The                most significant and serious charge brought against several of the                defendants was conspiracy to provide material support and resources                to Hizballah, a well-known terrorist organization based in Lebanon                and responsible for the 1983 truck bombings of the US Embassy and                Marine barracks in Beirut. The evidence showed that the defendants                were committing all these seemingly ordinary financial fraud crimes                for one purpose: to make money for Hizballah. And the investigation                began when a single deputy sheriff in North Carolina became suspicious                after stopping a car that was loaded with hundreds of cartons of                cigarettes. The driver was headed for Michigan where, as a result                of increased tobacco taxes in that state, each pack of cigarettes                could be sold for a $0.70 profit. As the investigation progressed,                it was discovered that vehicles loaded with massive quantities of                cigarettes had also been stopped in several other states, and all                were headed for Michigan.                Rather than simply write this off as another isolated effort to                avoid taxes, the investigators doggedly pursued the case and eventually                uncovered a massive conspiracy to keep illegal Lebanese aliens in                this country through sham marriages, the purchase of more than $10                million worth of cigarettes for illegal resale, and other fraud                schemes involving stolen credit cards and phony bank accounts. The                Profits of this illegal enterprise were being wired to Hizballah                contacts overseas, and the defendants were also planning to acquire                a number of otherwise lawful items for use by Hizballah, including                night vision devices, surveying equipment, metal detectors, aircraft                design software, computers, stun guns, radars, laser range finders,                and even more innocuous items such as cameras and binoculars.                Perhaps the most disturbing revelation in the case came as a result                of a search warrant executed at one of the defendant's homes. There                the officers found videotapes of Hizballah meetings being conducted                in the Middle East with hundreds of armed terrorists chanting anti-American                slogans, much like we see on the evening news. But there was also                another videotape, this one of a small child, no more that three                or four years old, being encouraged by a adult to repeat the same                hateful chants. That child could be in the United States today,                living in your hometown, attending school with your children.                So what can we do? There is no need to be paranoid or reactionary,                but we must be aware and vigilant. We must continue to educate ourselves                as to the different types of activities terrorists engage in, and                we must realize that conduct we might have previously written off                as isolated and routine could possibly be part of an international                conspiracy to promote terrorism. Simply put, we have to redefine                good police work. I suspect that the North Carolina deputy sheriff                first thought he was only making a routine traffic stop. But fortunately,                he knew what to look for, he had the courage to ask questions, and                he followed his instincts. In this day and time, that type of awareness                and vigilance now defines good police work.               Anti-terrorism Task Forces-                Each Federal District in the United State has an Anti-Terrorism                Task Force. These Anti-Terrorism Task Force (ATTF) are here to help.                The primary goals of the ATTF are the detection and prevention of                terrorist activities. To do so, the ATTF provides its members with                training and sends them the latest intelligence concerning terrorist                activities and trends so the officer on the street will know what                to look for and what to ask questions about. The ATTF also gathers                and analyzes information about suspicious activities occurring throughout                the state to look for trends that could be of concern right here                at home. Since the war on terrorism is too large for any of us to                tackle alone, the ATTF works with its members to help coordinate                information sharing and resource allocation. Assistant US Attorney                William Hochul is the lead in the ATTF effort. You may contact bill                at 716-843-5700 with your questions or concerns.

Top of Page                               The Federal Firearm Laws                and Their Effect on Possession of Rifles and Shotguns for Use For                Lawful Sporting and Hunting Purposes.                 Richard P. Maigret                Assistant U.S. Attorney                Western District of New York                 One of the most frequently asked questions that I receive concerns                what effect a past conviction has upon an individual's right to                possess rifles and/or shotguns solely for hunting or lawful sporting                purposes. As you can imagine, the number of questions along this                line of inquiry increases dramatically in the fall of the year as                deer hunting season approaches. The answer is somewhat complicated,                but simply put, the federal firearm statues do prohibit an individual                with certain types of prior criminal convictions from possessing                firearms or ammunition for any purpose. In order for such an individual                to legally possess firearms or ammunition, under federal law, such                an individual must have had his right to possess firearms restored.                The applicable federal statute is fairly straightforward. Title                18, United States Code, Section 922 (g) (1) states in its relevant                part:                (g) It shall be unlawful for any person-(1) who has been convicted                in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding                one year..                to... possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition;                or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or                transported in interstate or foreign commerce.                This is commonly known as the ""felon in possession""                statute. Of note is the fact that the federal law, unlike the state,                makes possession of firearms and ammunition by a felon a criminal                offense. This statute has three elements:                1. The weapon must be a firearm as defined under federal law or                ammunition as defined under federal law.                Initially, it is important to note the difference between the                definition of the term ""firearm"" under New York State                law as opposed to federal criminal statutes. Under New York State                law the term ""firearm"" refers only to handguns, that is                , revolvers or pistols, illegally shortened rifles or shotguns,                and semiautomatic assault rifles. More to the point, rifles and                shotguns are not considered firearms under New York State law.                Federal law, however, defines ""firearms"" to be ""any                weapon""... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted                to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive"" (18 USC                § 921 (a) (3) (A)). As such, the federal definition of ""firearm""                is broader than the state definition. Simply put, federal firearm                statutes cover and include not only handguns, but also rifles and                shotguns. For the purposes of this article, the only weapons that                would not be covered by the federal firearm statutes would be either                antique firearms, manufactured before 1898 or a muzzle loading rifle,                shotgun or pistol, designed to use black powder or a black powder                substitute and which could not use fixed ammunition.                Ammunition, under federal law, is defined as ""ammunition                or cartridge cases, primer, bullets or propellant powder, designed                for use in any firearm."" (18 USC § 921 (a) (17) (A)).                Thus, any one of the components of ammunition is enough is enough                to qualify as ""ammunition"" under federal law.                2. The weapon or ammunition must have traveled in interstate or                foreign commerce.                The second element requires that the firearm or ammunition must                have traveled in interstate or foreign commerce. This simply requires                that the firearm or ammunition must have crossed a state line or                international border at sometime prior to its possession by the                individual. This element is usually satisfied when the firearm or                ammunition has been manufactured outside of New York State.                However, firearms manufactured within New York State, for example,                Remington or Ithaca rifles or shotguns, that are sold to large federal                firearms dealers who store them outside of New York State, only                to later ship them to the individual stores within New York State,                would also satisfy this element as they have crossed a state line.                For example, Wal-Mart usually stores all of the firearms purchased                for its corporation in the State of Arkansas. Thus, most firearms                purchased from Wal-Mart stores, even if originally manufactured                in the State of New York, have probably been stared in the state                of Arkansas and then brought back into New York State, thereby satisfying                the second element of this offense.                It is important to note that it is not necessary that the individual                possessing the firearm was aware that it had crossed a state or                international border. Nor is it necessary that the individual possessing                the firearm actually carried or transported the firearm across such                a border. The statute is satisfied if at any time prior to their                possession by an individual either the firearm or the ammunition                had crossed a state or international border. Furthermore, even if                the firearm itself had been manufactured in New York and never traveled                outside the state, if the ammunition or any component of the ammunition                with which the weapon was loaded had been manufactured outside of                New York State, the federal laws would apply.                3. The ""prohibited"" individual must have previously                been convicted in any court of the crime punishable by imprisonment                for a term exceeding one year.                 The third requirement for prosecution under this statute is that                the individual in question had previously been convicted in any                court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding                one year. It is not necessary that the individual actually received                a sentence of imprisonment for a term greater than one year. It                is sufficient if the crime for which he/she was convicted could                have resulted in a sentence of imprisonment greater than one year.                In New York State, crimes punishable by a tern of imprisonment greater                than one year are considered felonies. Therefore, and individual                convicted of a New York State felony, even if he/she received only                a sentence of probation, would still be subject to this federal                statute and would be prohibited from possessing any firearms (including                rifles and shotguns) or ammunition.                                 Moreover, the term ""in any court"" means exactly what it                says. Any such conviction in any state court or foreign court would                qualify under this statute and subject the individual to prohibition                from possessing any firearm or ammunition. The age or date of such                conviction is irrelevant. Any such conviction whether it occurred                thirty days or thirty years ago would subject the individual to                this statute.                                 There exists however, several means and remedies to restore a prohibited                person's right to possess firearms and ammunition. These means and                remedies vary from state to state, and indeed from country to country.                I shall confirm the present discussion to only those remedies available                in New York State.                                What constitutes a crime that will trigger the prohibition of 18                U.S.C. § 922 (g) (1) is determined by ""the law of the                jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held"" (18 U.S.C.                § 921 (a) (20)).Therefore, the law of the country or state                where the conviction occurred will control whether or not an individual                is prohibited from possessing firearms or whether an individual                has had his/her rights to possess firearms restored. For purposes                of this discussion, simply put, if New York has restored an individual's                ""full right"" to possess all types of firearms, then he/she                is no longer prohibited by federal statutes from possessing firearms                and ammunition. I emphasize the term ""full right"" to possess                all types of firearms in New York State, I mean the right to possess                both long guns, rifles and shotguns in New York and the right to                apply for a New York State permit to possess had guns.                                 Although there are other means in New York State of restoring an                individual's right to own and possess forearms (e.g., gubernatorial                pardon, presidential pardon) the vast majority of such restorations                occur when the prohibited individual receives a Certificate of Relief                for Disabilities. Certificates of Relief from Disabilities in New                York state are classified into three categories and are identified                as type ""A"", Type ""B"", or Type ""C.""                                A Type ""A"" Certificate of Relief from Disabilities can                be issued by any competent court of the State of New York. Type                ""A"" Certificates are issued by the court at the time of                sentencing of an applicant/defendant. Type ""A"" Certificates                immediately restore an applicant's /defendant's ""full right""                to possess firearms in New York State. A type ""A"" Certificate                restores this right to the applicant at the time of its issuance                by the sentencing court, that is, the day of sentencing of the applicant/defendant.                Because a Type ""A"" Certificate restores the applicant's/defendant.                Because a Type ""A"" Certificate restores the applicant's/defendant's                ""full right"" to possess forearms in New York State, it                also restores the individual's federal right to possess firearms                and ammunition.                                 A Type ""B"" Certificate of Relief from disabilities is                also issued by any court of New York State, but at some time after                the applicant/defendant has been sentenced, usually after the sentence                has been completed. A Type ""B"" certificate restores and                applicant's/defendant's ""full right"" to possess firearms                in New York State and therefor also restores his her federal right                to possess firearms and ammunition.                                A Type ""C"" Certificate of Relief from disabilities can                be issued by any court of New York State and/or the New York State                Board of Parole (a distinction that I shall discuss in a moment).                A Type ""C"" Certificate differs from a Type ""A""                and ""B"" certificate in that a Type ""                C"" certificate requires the issuing entity to explicitly enumerate                which disabilities are being removed and/or which rights are being                restored. Simply put, if a Type ""C"" certificate does not                explicitly list that an applicant's right to possess firearms in                New York State is being restored, the recipient would not have such                firearms privileges restored. In this instance, it would be unlawful                for such an individual to possess firearms under New York State                law. Additionally, it would be unlawful for such an individual to                possess forearms or ammunition under federal law.                                As mentioned above, the distinction between the New York State definition                of firearms (handguns) and the federal definition of firearms (handguns                and long guns) has given rise to one very important anomaly with                respect to a Type ""C"" Certificate of Relief from Disabilities.                While a Type ""C"" Certificate that restores the ""full                right"" to possess all types of firearms in New York State to                an applicant would also restore the applicant's federal right to                possess firearms and ammunition, a Type ""C"" Certificate                that restores only a partial right to possess certain specified                types of firearms in New York state, does not restore such individual's                federal right to possess firearms and ammunition.                                 For example, a Type ""C"" Certificate that restores an individual's                New York state right to possess rifles and shotguns for hunting                purposes does not restore that individual's ""full right""                to possess firearms in New York state and therefore does not restore                that individual's federal right to possess firearms and ammunition.                Put another way, even though such an individual could legally possess                rifles and shotguns under New York State law, possession of said                rifles and shotguns and ammunition would be in violation of and                illegal under federal statutes.                                In order for a Type ""C"" Certificate to restore an individual's                federal firearm rights and privileges, the Certificate must not                only specifically restore the applicant's right to possess rifles                and shotguns under New York State law but must also restore the                applicant's right to apply for a New York State permit to possess                handguns. Absent the Type ""C"" Certificate's specific mention                of the restoration of the applicant's right to apply for a New York                State Pistol Permit, the applicant's federal right to possess firearms                and ammunition is not restored.                                As stated above, any court of New York state can issue Type ""A"",                ""B"" or ""C"" Certificates of Relief from Disabilities.                The New York State Board of Parole issues only Type ""C""                Certificates. New York State courts may issue Certificates of Relief                from Disabilities for any applicant who, upon conviction of a felony,                received a sentence of one year incarceration or less and if sentenced                to a period of incarceration, served that period in a local institution,                e.g., a county jail. Any applicant who was sentenced to a period                of incarceration of greater than one year, or who served a period                of incarceration in an institution under the jurisdiction of the                State Department of Correctional Services (state time) can only                receive a Certificate of relief from disabilities from the New York                state Board of Parole. Such Certificate would be a Type ""C""                Certificate.                                Finally, any individual who has been convicted more that one time                of a felony offense is not eligible to receive a Certificate of                Relief from disabilities under New York State law.                In summary then:                                Type ""A"" Certificates of Relief from disabilities:                 Are issued by courts of New York State at the time of sentencing                and,                                 Restores the ""full right"" to possess all types of firearms                in New York State and therefore also restores the right to possess                firearms and ammunition under federal law to the individual.               In Type ""B"" Certificates of Relief from Disabilities:                                Are issued by New York State courts at some time after the sentencing                of an applicant, and,                                Restores the ""full right"" to possess all types of firearms                in New York State and therefore also restores the right to possess                firearms and ammunition under federal law to the individual.               Type ""C"" Certificates of Relief from Disabilities:                Are issued by New York State courts if the applicant did not serve                a period of ""state time"" incarceration:                Are issued by the New York State Board of Parole if the applicant                did serve a period of ""state time"" incarceration;                Must specify what privilege is being restored, and only restores                the right to possess firearms and ammunition under federal law if                it restores the ""full right"" to possess all types of firearms                in New York State, that is, if it restores the applicant's privilege                to possess long guns and to apply for a New York State Pistol Permit                (the right to possess handguns in New York).                                It is obvious that the restoration of federal firearm and ammunition                privileges is a complex legal issue and procedure. While such Certificates                of Relief from Disabilities are often granted to applicants, the                process can be long and complicated and almost invariably requires                the services of a competent attorney.

Battle                              US Attorney WDNY                 Born in New York City in 1955 to Julius Battle and Alice                Clay, United States Attorney for the Western District of New York                Michael A. Battle was appointed by President George W. Bush on November                15, 2001 and confirmed by the United States Senate on January 25,                2002 for a term of four years.               Upon graduating from Dewitt Clinton High School in New York City,                Judge Battle attended Ithaca College where he received a Bachelor                of Arts Degree in Sociology/Anthropology in 1977. From there,Battle                attended State University of New York at Buffalo Law School where                he obtained his Juris Doctor in December 1981. After being admitted                to practice law in the State of New York, Battle worked as a staff                attorney with the Legal Aid Society Civil Division in Manhattan                for 4-1/2 years. From there, he was recruited by then United States                Attorney Salvatore R. Martoche to be an Assistant US Attorney in                Buffalo, a position he held from 1985 through 1992. As an Assistant                under Martoche, interim US Attorney Roger Williams, and then US                Attorney Dennis C. Vacco, Battle served in the General Litigation                Unit where he prosecuted federal cases such as illegal narcotics                distribution, income tax evasion and bank robbery. Before departing                the office in 1992, Battle served full-time as an Assistant in the                Civil Division.               Judge Battle, along with now United States Magistrate Judge Jonathan                Feldman of Rochester and current Federal Public Defender of the                Western District of New York William Clauss, then established the                Federal Public Defenders Office in Rochester and a satellite office                in Buffalo. Battle remained in that office from April 1992 until                November of 1995, having assisted in doubling the staff during his                tenure. That office now is thriving and is integral to criminal                justice in Federal Court in Western New York.               Judge Battle then accepted an appointment from then New York State                Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco, to be his Assistant in Charge                of the Buffalo office. During his tenure, Battle supervised a staff                of 55 including 21 lawyers.               Judge Battle left the Attorney General's Office in June 1996 after                18 months to accept an appointment by Governor George E. Pataki                to fill a vacancy on the Erie County Family Court Bench. In November                of that same year, after winning both the Democratic and Republican                primaries, Judge Battle was elected by the citizens of Erie County                to retain that seat for 10 years.               Judge Battle loves Western New York. He believes in and has an                abiding interest in the people and the growth of this area. He is                married to a native Buffalonian, the former Sheila H. Jones, a physical                therapist in Western New York. They have three children -- Elisse,                20 years old, Nicole, 18 years old, and Michael II, 12 years old.                Battle's children have attended Buffalo Public and private schools.                His daughter Elisse is currently a student at the State University                of New York at Albany, in her third year, and Nicole is a Freshman                at American University in Washington, D.C.               Judge Battle has been extensively involved in the community over                the past 16 years. He is currently a member of the New York State                Bar and Erie County Bar Associations. In 1994, he served as President                of the Minority Bar Association of Western New York. He currently                serves as an advisor to the organization.

Although New York State law does                not expressly provide for enforcement of federal criminal laws,                it appears that arrests of individuals by state and local officers                for federal criminal immigration violations are authorized. Section                140.10 of the N.Y. Criminal Procedure Law provides in pertinent                part that a police officer may arrest a person for:               a. Any offense when he has reasonable cause to                believe that such person has committed such offense in his presence;                and               b. A crime when he has reasonable cause to believe                that such person has committed such crime, whether in his presence                or otherwise.               New York Penal Law section 10.00(1) defines ""offense""                as ""conduct for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment                or to a fine is provided by any law of this state or by any law                or ordinance of a political subdivision of this state..."" Section                10.00(6) defines ""crime"" as ""a misdemeanor or felony.""               Although this statutory definition of ""offense""                might support an argument that by expressly including only state                law crimes, police officers are precluded from enforcing federal                criminal laws, the New York Attorney General’s office has an opinion                otherwise:                                                   There is substantial support for the position                    that the Penal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law, although                    explicitly referring only to state and local crimes, do not                    exclude federal crimes from the scope of authority granted to                    police officers and others to make warrantless arrests. It must                    be noted, however, that almost all of the support for this proposition                    is from the Second Circuit and that there is no state court                    opinion that directly so holds. Informal Opinion 2000-1, 2000                    WL 420372, page 1.                                             The opinion assesses the federal case law, with                particular focus on the Second Circuit’s discussion of the issue                in  United States v. Swarovski , 557 F.2d 40 (2d Cir. 1977),                 cert. denied , 434 US 1045 (1978). In  Swarorski , the                court categorically rejected the idea that the intention was to                limit state officers’ authority to enforce criminal law, finding                that the practice was well established in New York:                                                   The New York State Legislature could, of course,                    have codified the interpretation of existing statutes to include                    the right to arrest federal felons, but this was hardly necessary                    in the light of 200 years of a well developed custom and a pattern                    of state participation and cooperation in arresting, and placing                    in federal custody, violators of federal criminal law in the                    State, a practice which is now so vital and important in any                    high crime area of the nation.  Swarovski  at 47-48.                                             As noted in the Attorney General’s opinion, however,                it should be kept in mind that New York courts do not appear to                have ruled on this issue.               In  United States v. Viale , 312 F.2d 595,                600-01,(2d Cir.),  cert. denied , 373 US 903 (1963), the Second                Circuit held that state officers were authorized to arrest for violations                of federal misdemeanors under the New York statute which allows                a private citizen to arrest for misdemeanors committed in his or                her presence. However, it is not sufficient to justify an arrest                that the arrestee be subsequently shown to have been engaged in                committing a misdemeanor at the moment of the arrest; the officer                must have had reason to be aware at that time of the commission                of the crime.               Federal immigration criminal offenses which state                and local police officers may encounter are as follows:               Title 8, United States Code, Section 1324: alien                smuggling (a felony);               Title 8, United States Code, Section 1325: entering                the US without inspection (a misdemeanor for first offense, a felony                for subsequent violations);               Title 8, United States Code, Section 1326: re-entry                by a deported alien (a felony);               Title 8, United States Code, Section 1304: failure                to carry alien registration card (""greencard"") (a misdemeanor);               Title 18, United States Code, Section 911: false                claim to US citizenship (a felony);               Title 18, United States Code, Section 1544: misuse                of someone else’s passport (a felony); and               Title 18, United States Code, Section 1546: use                of a fraudulent passport or green card (a felony).               In implementing the arrest authority granted by                state law, local police must be able to distinguish between criminal                and civil violations and the evidence pertinent to each. With respect                to civil immigration violations, arrests cannot be made by officers                other than INS officials. The fact that an alien may be an ""illegal                alien"" does not necessarily mean that he or she has committed                a federal criminal offense. There are numerous reasons why an alien                could be illegally present in the United States without having entered                in violation of section 1325. Examples include expiration of a visitor's                visa, change of student status, or acquisition of prohibited employment.                Arrest of a person for illegal presence would exceed the authority                granted New York police by state law. Furthermore, an arresting                officer cannot assume that an alien who admits he lacks proper documentation                has violated section 1325. Although the lack of documentation or                other admission of illegal presence may be some indication of illegal                entry, it does not, without more, provide probable cause of the                criminal violation of illegal entry. An arrest must therefore be                supported by additional evidence that the arrestee entered without                inspection.               In  Gonzales v. the City of Peoria , 722 F.2d                468 (9 th  Cir. 1983),  overruled on other grounds ,                 Hodgers-Durgin v. De La Vina , 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir.1999),                the Ninth Circuit concluded that state law authorized local police                to enforce the criminal provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization                Act. The court emphasized, however, that this authorization was                limited to criminal violations. In that case, problems had arisen                from the City's written policies which failed to distinguish between                civil and criminal violations of the Act. Several of the policy                statements used the term ""illegal alien,"" which obscured                the distinction between civil and the criminal violations. In some                instances, that term was used by the City to mean an alien who had                illegally entered the country, which is a criminal violation under                section 1325. In others, it meant an alien who was illegally present                in the United States, which might mean only a civil violation.               ""Detention"" defines a special category                of Fourth Amendment seizures that are substantially less intrusive                than arrests.  Dunaway v. New York , 442 US 200, 210 (1979).                Because detention represents only a limited intrusion, it can be                justified by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at                211-12. However, that suspicion justifies only a brief stop and                interrogation and, under proper circumstances, a brief check for                weapons.  United States v. Brignoni-Ponce , 422 US 873, 881-82                (1975);  Terry v. Ohio , 392 US 1, 27 (1968). If the seizure                involves anything more than the brief and narrowly-defined intrusion                authorized by Terry, it must be justified by probable cause.  Dunaway ,                442 US at 212;  Brignoni-Ponce , 422 US at 882.  Dunaway                 makes absolutely clear that where a person is transported to the                police station and placed in a cell or interrogation room he has                been arrested, even if the purpose of the seizure is investigatory                rather than accusatory. 442 US at 212-13;  see also Brown v. Illinois ,                422 US 590 (1975). Because such a seizure constitutes an arrest,                it must be supported by probable cause.  Dunaway , 442 US at                214.               In seizing persons suspected of violations of 8                U.S.C. § 1325, Peoria police have adopted a procedure identical                to that described in Dunaway. Defendants are walked or driven to                the police station and held pending interrogation by the Border                Patrol. This seizure constitutes an arrest, and the constitutional                standards cannot be avoided by labeling it a mere detention. Prior                to invoking this procedure, the police must therefore have probable                cause to believe either that illegal entry has occurred or that                another offense has been committed. As we have indicated, inability                to produce documentation does not in itself provide probable cause.                For example, if a passenger in a vehicle stopped by the police cannot,                or does not, provide identification, his failure to do so does not                justify transporting him to the station and holding him for the                Border Patrol.  See Florida v. Royer , 460 US ----, ----, 103                S.Ct. 1319, 1324 (1983) (plurality opinion);  Brown v. Texas ,                443 US 47, 53 (1979).               To summarize, nothing in federal law precludes                local and state police from enforcing the criminal provisions of                the Immigration and Naturalization Act. New York law authorizes                local officers to arrest for violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1325 where                there is probable cause to believe the arrestee has illegally entered                the United States. However, officers must distinguish illegal entry                from illegal presence and must comply with all arrest requirements                imposed by the federal Constitution.                              Top of Page                                                              Integrated Border                Enforcement Teams                              On December 3, 2001, the United States and Canada                signed a Joint Statement on Cooperation on Border Security and Regional                Migration Issues which calls for the expansion of Integrated Border                Enforcement Teams (IBETS) along the border. IBETS are multi-agency                field level groups of law enforcement officials dedicated to securing                the integrity of the border by sharing information and technology                and endeavoring to coordinate all activities to minimize duplication                of effort and maximize the enforcement effect within a specific                geographic area of the border region. To begin the implementation                of the Joint Statement on January 29, 2002, over two hundred people                from law enforcement agencies in the United States and Canada met                in Niagara Falls, Canada to discuss the formation of IBETS along                the US/Canada border from Detroit/Windsor to Lake Champlain. The                IBETS’ concept is a more fully defined operational plan that identifies                law enforcement goals, partners, parameters and general logistics                of planned joint operations and resource commitments from participating                agencies and which builds on the existing cooperation between Canadian                and US law enforcement.               Participants agreed that a Buffalo/Niagara IBET                would be formed, to include an Integrated Marine Enforcement Team                (IMET) for the water. Representatives from Canadian, New York, and                Federal law enforcement agencies will hold a follow-up meeting on                March 22, 2002 at 10:00AM. at the Niagara Falls Marriott, 6740 Oakes                Drive, N.F. Ontario (305) 357-7300. The Marriott offers free valet                parking for your convenience.

In the Western District of New York, the FBI has                formed the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) which is a formalized                effort involving federal, state and local officers. The Task Force                involves  full-time dedication  of police personnel including                participation by FBI, New York State Police, ATF, Lackawanna Police                Department, U. S. Customs, Amherst Police Department, Niagara Falls                Police Department, Immigration & Naturalization Service, U.                S. Border Patrol, Niagara County Sheriff’s Office, US Secret Service,                New York State Attorney General's Office, and Erie County Sheriff’s                Office.               In addition to the JTTF, a 24/7 Contact List for                major law enforcement departments in Upstate New York has also been                undertaken. This group, known as the Anti-Terrorism Task Force (ATTF)                is designed to maintain a ready list of available police agencies                and officers who would be available should any terrorist event occur                in the upstate area. The ATTF has been conducting monthly meetings                and most recently undertook an intensive one-day anti-terrorism                training for law enforcement officials from throughout Upstate New                York and Southern Ontario. On January 10, 2002 over 600 officers                from throughout the Region attended the training at the State University                of New York at Buffalo, Amherst Campus, and received training on                topics including ""Critical Incident Management,"" ""Introduction                to Middle East Terrorism and Infrastructures of Radical Groups,""                ""Biological Threats,"" ""Immigration & Naturalization                Service (Documentation, Structure and Interviewing)."" The ATTF                is now developing additional training including a likely Table-Top                Exercise involving terrorist threats to the railroad and other transportation                related modals (including the international issues that are involved).                At the time this newsletter is issued, the ATTF's next full meeting                will occur on March 12, 2002 at the United States Attorney's Office,                Buffalo, New York.

Knights , ___U.S. ___,                122 S. Ct. 587, 2001 WL 1560882 (2001).               Knights has agreed, as a condition of his state                probation, to submit his residence to a search any time, with or                without a search warrant, by any probation officer or law enforcement                officer. Subsequently, a state law enforcement officer, who was                aware of the probation condition, searched the residence without                a warrant, and obtained evidence which led to a federal indictment.               The District Court and 9 th  Circuit Court                of Appeals suppressed the evidence. The Supreme Court, however,                reversed, finding that the warrant less search satisfied the Fourth                Amendment. The Court did not decide whether the consent to the condition                of probation constituted a waiver, but held that the condition ""significantly                diminished Knights’ reasonable expectation of privacy.""

Wilson of the Washington College of Law at the American University in Washington, D.C., and technical support provided through text enhancements by Scott Wallace, director of Defender Services at the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, and Patricia Puritz, director of the American Bar Association Juvenile Justice Center.  vii   Executive Summary The obligation of the States to provide legal representation to people accused of crime who are too poor to retain their own counsel was established by the U.S. Supreme Court as a matter of Federal constitutional law in 1963, in the case of Gideon v. Wainwright. The attorneys general of 22 States joined in urging the Court to do so. In the intervening three and a half decades, States have responded to Gideon in various ways. Some have shouldered the responsibility themselves, establishing and funding statewide agencies to provide indigent defense. In others, counties bear the burden. Three service-delivery models have evolved: governmental public defender agencies, bulk contracts with private lawyers, and case-by-case appointments. National standards have been promulgated and have been implemented by States and localities in different ways, covering issues such as maximum annual caseloads, staffing ratios, resource parity with prosecution and courts, training, attorney qualifications and performance, and defender independence from the political forces and judicial branches. But the extent to which States and localities are succeeding in fulfilling the promise of Gideon varies widely. Overall, despite progress in many jurisdictions, indigent defense in the United States today is in a chronic state of crisis. Standards are frequently not implemented, contracts are often awarded to the lowest bidder without regard to the scope or quality of services, organizational structures are weak, workloads are high, and funding has not kept pace with other components of the criminal justice system. The effects can be severe, including legal representation of such low quality to amount to no representation at all, delays, overturned convictions, and convictions of the innocent. Ultimately, as Attorney General Janet Reno states, the lack of competent, vigorous legal representation for indigent defendants calls into question the legitimacy of criminal convictions and the integrity of the criminal justice system as a whole. In 1997, the Attorney General and officials of the Office of Justice Programs and the Bureau of Justice Assistance convened a focus group of 35 leaders of the indigent defense community and identified 6 areas in which the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) could play an effective role in promoting strong and stable indigent defense systems.       Using the DOJ's leadership role to call attention to the importance of quality indigent defense services. Promoting independence in indigent defense structures. Allocating resources equitably among indigent defense and other criminal justice system components. Focusing on these challenges in the juvenile justice system. Promoting standards for indigent defense programs. Building a capacity for computer technology in indigent defense.  ix   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  In the DOJ's continuing dialogue with the indigent defense community and examination of potential reforms, attention was also focused on the importance of collaborations between indigent defense and other justice system agencies in planning, managing, and budgeting for the system as a whole. The National Symposium on Indigent Defense was organized around these six issues and the goal of collaboration. Themes emerging from the symposium include the following: Forging Consensus: Indigent defense is an integral, interdependent part of the criminal justice system. Advocacy strategies for indigent defense must be addressed systemically, in coordination and balance with the rest of the system. The symposium's multidisciplinary attendance-- including defenders, prosecutors, judges, police, legislators, county officials, and bar representatives--similarly was designed to foster dialogue, a recognition of symbiosis, and a collaborative search for solutions. Independence: The ethical imperative of providing quality representation to clients should not be compromised by outside interference or political attacks. Indigent defenders should be subject to judicial supervision only to the same extent as lawyers in private practice. The primary means of ensuring defender independence is to provide for oversight by an independent board or commission, rather than directly by judicial, legislative, or executive agencies or officials. Statewide Structure: The trend supported by national standards has been toward statewide indigent defense structures. Organizing defense services through a centrally administered program promotes quality and uniformity of defense services, as well as cost-efficiencies, cohesive planning, and accountability. Statewide organization commonly results from an imminent indigent defense funding crisis, which spurs collaborative planning, study, and action by bar associations, funding agencies, and the courts. Equitable Allocation of Resources: Salary parity between prosecutors and defenders is a central component of all national standards and is an important means of reducing staff turnover and avoiding related recruitment/training costs and disruptions to the office and case processing. The concept of parity encompasses all resource allocations, including staffing and workloads, support staff, investigative and expert services, and technology, as well as access to Federal grant programs and student loan forgiveness options. Juvenile Justice: Comprehensive, effective juvenile interventions can help avert future criminality and the substantial costs of future encounters with the adult courts and correctional systems. Holistic juvenile team defense includes social workers and mental health professionals, as well as attorneys, and involves the parents of juvenile clients. Indigent Defense Standards: Standards are the most effective means of ensuring uniform quality of indigent defense services. States and localities have adopted standards in a variety of ways, including by court decision, statute, court rules, and incorporation into indigent defense services contracts; enforcement mechanisms include requiring local compliance as a condition of supplemental State funding. Technology: Technology is increasingly critical to the fast, efficient, and cost-effective processing of cases. Technology integration and information sharing between indigent defense and other justice system agencies, as well as parity of technological resources, reduce redundancy, improve the efficiency of the entire system, and promote earlier disposition of cases and more appropriate, individualized, and effective sanctioning of convicted offenders. x   Executive Summar y  Successful Collaborations: Indigent defense as a full partner in the criminal justice system already exists in a number of areas.  Criminal justice coordinating committees are a forum for collaborative justice system problem-solving, planning, and innovation and can address special areas such as drug treatment, domestic violence, docket management, and indigent defense funding. Juvenile justice collaborations with community-based services for offenders in the juvenile justice system can help avert recidivism. When juveniles are subject to adult prosecution, coordination among agencies such as courts, police, probation, mental health and family services, social services, and schools can reduce delays in case processing and ensure more accurate assess-ments of amenability to treatment in the juvenile system. ""Fill the Gap"" collaborations among adjudication agencies (courts, prosecutors, defenders, and court administration) can help them obtain the funding necessary to keep up with the extra caseloads generated by major funding infusions for other components of the system, such as police and corrections. Drug treatment courts are one of the most common type of adjudication partnership. These courts replace the defender's traditional adversarial role with a collaborative orientation toward the long-term interests of the client. Joint weighted caseload studies are collaborations among courts, prosecutors, and public defenders on a shared methodology for projecting caseloads and resource needs, which can improve planning and budgeting for the entire system. Juvenile defenders and dependency cases increase defender responsibility for noncriminal matters, such as representation of both children and parents in dependency, abuse, and neglect matters, and require new partnerships with other entities, including family courts, family law bar associations, government agencies, and planning bodies responsible for protecting juveniles. Mental health courts, like drug treatment courts, are an example of an adjudication partnership of courts, prosecutors, defenders and treatment providers, emphasizing placement in community-based residential treatment facilities as an alternative to jail. Early entry team defenses, like community policing and community courts, are community-based defender programs--storefront offices providing a broader range of representation than conventional programs--and are oriented toward early intervention and crime prevention.                The unifying themes of the symposium were 1) the necessity of maintaining core values, civility, respect, and trust, not only within indigent defense programs but in interactions with other components of the criminal justice system; 2) the challenge of reconciling adversarial defense skills with the imperative of collaboration in a complex, increasingly interconnected system; 3) the importance of increasing availability of affordable technology and interagency information sharing to make all agencies more efficient and effective; and 4) the movement toward holistic defense services focused less on isolated episodes of legal representation and more on recidivism prevention and long-term improvement of clients' lives.  xi   Message From the U.S. Attorney General Never before in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has there been a meeting like this historic national symposium on indigent defense. The Department of Justice has brought together representatives from all levels of government and from every part of the criminal justice system to explore how we can better collaborate to strengthen indigent defense services and, by extension, the criminal justice system as a whole. I applaud the efforts of Assistant Attorney General Laurie Robinson; Nancy Gist, Director, Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA); and everyone in the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and the Bureau of Justice Assistance, all of whom worked extremely hard to bring this extraordinary group together. My experiences as a prosecutor and as Attorney General have taught me just how important it is for every leg of the criminal justice system to stand strong. Indigent defense is an equally essential element of the criminal justice process, one which should be appropriately structured and funded and operating with effective standards. The reality is that despite the U.S. Supreme Court's decision 36 years ago in Gideon v. Wainwright that every defendant, rich or poor, has the right to be represented by a lawyer when charged with a serious crime, many adult and juvenile offenders are not receiving effective assistance of counsel. But it is not just poor defendants who have a stake in our system of indigent defense. Just ask a prosecutor, an arresting officer, or even a victim of crime. Would they rather face a vigorous defense at trial or risk an overturned conviction and retrial? When the conviction of a defendant is challenged on the basis of inadequate representation, the very legitimacy of the conviction itself is called into question. Our criminal justice system is interdependent: if one leg of the system is weaker than the others, the whole system will ultimately falter. I believe that all of us, regardless of our position in the criminal justice system, have the responsibility to work to improve the quality of criminal defense for the poor. Our system of justice will only work, and will only inspire complete confidence and trust of the people, if we have strong prosecutors, an impartial judiciary, and a strong system of indigent criminal defense. I firmly believe that the Justice Department, as the Nation's leading Federal law enforcement agency, is uniquely positioned to call needed attention to indigent defense issues and play an important role in strengthening indigent defense. The Department of Justice has supported improvements in indigent defense and fostered collaboration among all parts of the criminal justice system by committing our resources and using our influence to promote adequate and efficient indigent defense systems. The Office of Justice Programs, the sponsor of the symposium, and the Department of Justice's Office of Policy Development have developed a comprehensive plan for the Justice Department's work on indigent defense that comprises six building blocks. First, our strategy starts with the need for an understanding of the scope and nature of the most important problems facing indigent defense. I have been engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the leadership of national defender organizations to get their perspective on what issues and  xiii   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  problems should be addressed. At our meetings, we have had wide-ranging, open discussions of the issues, including the need for reasonable rates of compensation for public defenders and assigned counsel, increased access to technology for indigent defense lawyers, more opportunities for professional training, and workable standards for indigent defense. Also, for the first time since 1983, the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) is collecting comprehensive, national data on indigent defense systems. These data will provide current information about how different jurisdictions operate and identify indigent defense models that work. Second, we have made a commitment to educating the public and the criminal justice community about the importance of a strong system of indigent defense. I firmly believe that, as the Nation's top law enforcement agency, we have a responsibility to explain that a strong system of indigent defense is good for prosecutors, police, victims, the public, and the pursuit of justice. To further this goal, I have encouraged governors, chief justices, bar association presidents, and others to use their positions of leadership to play a role in improving indigent defense services. This year, for example, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, Jim Robinson, spoke about indigent defense issues at the annual meeting of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. When Department of Justice officials speak about the importance of indigent defense, they send a message that every part of the criminal justice system should be concerned about indigent defense. Third, the Department of Justice has supported efforts to increase funding for indigent criminal defense. Disparities in resources among different parts of the criminal justice system have had a corrosive effect on the ability of poor defendants to secure effective representation. At the Federal level, we have called on Congress to provide the funds necessary to enable Criminal Justice Act (CJA) Attorneys to earn the $75 per hour rate that they are authorized to receive. We have also urged State Byrne Program administrators to include defenders on their policy boards and consider the needs of indigent defense in their planning and funding decisions. Wherever it is appropriate, we identify defenders as eligible applicants in grant announcements. For example, under the open solicitation issued by the Bureau of Justice Assistance in 1998, the public defender in Vermont received a $150,000 grant so that developmentally disabled defendants could be evaluated by medical specialists to determine when necessary accommodations should be made consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act. These types of programs ensure that everyone gets treated fairly by the criminal justice system. While we have supported increased funding for indigent defense, we also have been working with the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, States, and localities to appropriately contain the costs of these services. Every part of the criminal justice system, indigent defense included, must work to deliver quality services at a reasonable cost. Even though indigent defense services are the most poorly funded part of the system, there are ways, such as sharing technology and pooling resources, to make the system operate more efficiently and effectively. By doing so, we will be better able to make the case for increased funding.  xiv   Message From the U.S. Attorney General  Fourth, I strongly believe that, not only can prosecutors and defenders work together to improve the system, they can also learn together through joint training. My prosecutors in Miami told me time and again that some of their best training experiences were at the University of Florida, where they trained together with public defenders. That is why the Justice Department is actively exploring possibilities for joint training programs for Federal prosecutors and defenders. We have also made grants to provide training and technical assistance to State and local indigent defense service providers. For example, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) is establishing a Juvenile Defender Center to provide resources, training, and technical assistance through the American Bar Association (ABA). And the Bureau of Justice Assistance awarded grants to the Vera Institute to train senior managers of indigent defense services, and to the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NALDA) to provide technical assistance and training to State and local defenders. Fifth, the Justice Department is working to ensure that we bring the tools of technology to every part of the criminal justice system. Technology creates incredible opportunities for accessing and exchanging information, managing cases, investigating crimes, and improving the efficiency and quality of our work. To that end, the Bureau of Justice Assistance announced a series of awards to support indigent defense training and case management, with an eye to emerging technological and evidentiary aids. The sixth building block in our comprehensive plan for indigent defense is improving the quality of indigent defense by encouraging the development and dissemination of minimum standards and best practices. I believe this effort is essential if our Nation is to fulfill our obligation under Gideon to provide competent counsel to every criminal defendant charged with a serious crime. With a lot of input from the defense bar, we are in the process of developing links to the Office of Justice Programs Web site--which will be accessible through the Justice Department Web site at www.usdoj.gov--to enable all who are interested to download ""best practices documents"" and other useful materials. Also, we are collecting information on standards for indigent defense programs and representation from around the country. An advisory board of practitioners will review these standards, and the Bureau of Justice Assistance will publish a compendium of those standards that represent the best in criminal defense practice today. We should evaluate how well best practices work by identifying a local jurisdiction in which leaders in the court system, the bar, and the local government will commit to becoming a model jurisdiction for indigent defense by adopting best practices and minimum standards. Finally, I would like to go back to where I began and touch again on the important work taking place at this symposium to improve our indigent defense systems through collaboration. Collaboration is the motor that drives the engine of progress on indigent defense, and many powerful models of that motor are represented here today.  The effort in Fulton County, Georgia's to improve indigent defense by bringing together every player in the system to develop a criminal justice plan.  xv   National Symposium on Indigent Defense    Nebraska's statewide study of indigent defense by a broad-based task force including representatives from all three branches of State government, leading prosecutors, defenders, academics, and county officials. Florida and Arizona's efforts to ""fill the gap"" in funding so that the adjudicatory phase of the process is as well funded as the enforcement and corrections phases. Delaware's project to create a statewide computer system to link all components of the criminal justice system, including indigent defense.     These examples, and many others, should inspire us to do more. While we at the Department of Justice have been working to improve indigent defense, those who provide indigent defense services around the country are the real heroes and heroines on this issue. I commit to building our partnership with you. Our efforts at the Justice Department depend on every other part of the criminal justice system, at every level of government, working together to provide full luster and sound to Gideon's trumpet. Janet Reno February 1999  xvi   I. Historical Background on Indigent Defense Services in the United States Roots of the modern right to counsel for the indigent defendant can be found more than a century ago. Indiana Supreme Court Justice Frank Sullivan, Jr., cited Webb v. Baird,1 a case decided by Indiana's high court in 1853, in his remarks at the symposium. He noted that Webb recognized a right to an attorney at public expense for an indigent person accused of crime, grounded in ""the principles of a civilized society,"" not in constitutional or statutory law. He quoted Webb's enduring message: ""It is not to be thought of in a civilized community for a moment that any citizen put in jeopardy of life or liberty should be debarred of counsel because he is too poor to employ such aid. No court could be expected to respect itself to sit and hear such a trial. The defense of the poor in such cases is a duty which will at once be conceded as essential to the accused, to the court, and to the public."" The sixth amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, ""In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense."" The right to counsel in Federal proceedings was well established by statute early in this country's history and was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court long ago in Johnson v. Zerbst.2 The Webb v. Baird decision, however, was the exception rather than the rule in the States. Well into the 20th century, most States relied only on the volunteer pro bono efforts of lawyers to provide defense for poor people accused of even the most serious crimes. Although some private programs, such as the 1 2 3 4 5  New York Legal Aid Society, were active as early as 1896 in providing counsel to needy immigrants and the first public defender office began operations in Los Angeles in 1914, such services were nonexistent outside the largest cities. The Court developed the sixth amendment right to counsel in State proceedings gradually and somewhat haltingly in this century. In Powell v. Alabama,3 the famous ""Scottsboro Case"" from the Depression era, the Court held that counsel was required in all State capital proceedings. Only a decade later, however, in Betts v. Brady,4 the Court declined to extend the sixth amendment right to counsel to State felony proceedings. It was not until 1963, 21 years after Betts, that the Court again addressed the issue of the right to counsel in State proceedings involving serious noncapital crimes. In a dramatic series of decisions, the Court firmly established the right to counsel in virtually all aspects of State criminal proceedings. The most significant decision on the right to counsel in U.S. Supreme Court history was Gideon v. Wainwright,5 which overruled Betts v. Brady. The Court held that an indigent person accused of a serious crime was entitled to the appointment of defense counsel at State expense. In an unprecedented early collaboration between defense counsel and prosecutors, 22 State attorneys general joined petitioner Clarence Earl Gideon in arguing that sixth amendment protection be extended to all defendants charged with felonies in State courts. Four years later, with its  6 Ind. 13 304 U.S. 287 U.S. 316 U.S. 372 U.S.  (1853). 458 (1938). 45 (1932). 455 (1942). 335 (1963).  1   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  decision in In re Gault,6 the Court built on the Gideon decision to extend to children the same rights as adults by providing counsel to an indigent child charged in juvenile delinquency proceedings. The right to counsel in trial courts was significantly expanded again when the Court, in Argersinger v. Hamlin,7 extended the right to counsel to all misdemeanor State proceedings in which there is a potential loss of liberty. The decisions in Gideon, Gault, and Argersinger are the best known of the right-tocounsel cases in the U.S. Supreme Court, but they were part of a broader array of decisions rendered by the Court in the past three decades, all of which protect the right to counsel for poor persons. The Court recognized the indigent defendant's right to counsel at such critical stages of criminal proceedings as postarrest interrogation,8 lineups and other identification procedures,9 preliminary hearings,10 arraignments,11 and plea negotiations.12 After conviction, the indigent defendant is constitutionally guaranteed the right to counsel in sentencing proceedings,13 appeals of right,14 and, in some cases, probation and parole proceedings.15 In addition, the right to counsel for indigent defendants often extends, under State or Federal law or practice, to collateral attacks on a conviction as well as a range of what might be called ""quasi-criminal"" proceedings involving loss of liberty, such as mental competency and commitment proceedings, extradition, prison disciplinary proceedings, status hearings for juveniles, and some family matters such as nonpayment of court-ordered support or contempt proceedings, as well as child dependency, 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  abuse, and neglect situations. Finally, in any criminal proceeding in which counsel appears, the defendant is entitled to counsel's effective assistance.16 These diverse Federal requirements under the U.S. Constitution, often supplemented by more stringent State standards, created enormous pressures on the lawyers who provided indigent defense. The mandate of the Gideon, Gault, and Argersinger decisions, as well as the Court's requirement to provide counsel at all critical stages of a prosecution, meant that government would have to assume vastly increased costs for providing counsel to the poor. Policymakers began to think in earnest about more systematic ways to deliver constitutionally required defense services. The first significant collaboration in the justice sector occurred in 1974, when thenAttorney General Richard Kleindeinst lent his own and his office's support to a project called the National Study Commission on Defense Services. The National Study Commission, with ongoing guidance from the Justice Department, published its final report, Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States, in 1976. Those enduring guidelines built on an equally influential set of standards developed in 1973 by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals (NAC). It was NAC that proposed public defender caseload standards, which have formed the basis for all current workload standards at the Federal, State, and local levels.17 NAC proposed that a public defender office should handle the following average number of cases, per attorney, per year:18  387 US. 1 (1967). 407 US. 25 (1972). Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 437 (1966); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977). United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967) (lineups); Moore v. Illinois, 434 U.S. 220 (1977) (one-person showups). Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 (1970). Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52 (1961). Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742 (1970); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759 (1970). Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736 (1948); United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443 (1972). Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963). Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128 (1967). Strickland v.

States, including statutes, court rules, court decisions or settlement of law suits, endorsement or adoption by bar associations, incorporation into contracts for defense services, adoption after self-evaluation, or outside evaluation by national technical assistance providers. Standards were the subject of a panel discussion that are summarized in this report (see appendix 8). The era of the personal computer and the Internet allows major improvements both within indigent defense systems and in their integration into comprehensive criminal justice information networks. Governments at every level are learning that parity of technological resources and shared access to essential case information are essential to reducing the costs and redundancy of criminal justice operations, improving the efficiency of the entire system, and promoting earlier disposition of cases and more appropriate, individualized, and effective sanctioning of convicted offenders. The Federal Government is leading the way in the inclusion of indigent defense in these technology integration efforts through criminal justice information integration initiatives at the national and international levels. Information networking, case management systems, and computerized case processing are three strong tools for defender program managers to use in the increasingly sophisticated provision of defense services, whether in large city or State defender offices or loosely networked local systems.  The NAC and National Study Commission standards, along with a subsequent generation of indigent defense standards, continue to provide clear, comprehensive guidance to defenders, legislators, policymakers, and other criminal justice system officials throughout the United States. Specific areas covered include juvenile justice (ABA and the National Advisory Committee for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 1980), appellate defense services (NLADA, 1980), contracting for defense services (NLADA, 1984), death penalty cases (NLADA, 1988, and ABA, 1989), assigned counsel systems (NLADA, 1989), performance guidelines for criminal defense representation (NLADA, 1995), and defender training (NLADA, 1997). A third edition of the well-recognized ABA Standards for Criminal Justice on the Defense Function (1993) and Providing Defense Services (1992) drew on many of these standards. More developed standards in the field of juvenile representation in abuse and neglect proceedings followed in 1996. These standards have been implemented in various ways in the  3   II. Indigent Defense Services Today There are three basic models for the delivery of defense services: the staffed public defender model, with employees on salary; the assigned counsel model, in which private attorneys are appointed to provide defense services either from an ad hoc list maintained by the courts or through some more systematic organization of services; and the contract model, whereby individual attorneys or firms contract to provide some or all of a jurisdiction's indigent defense services. Today, the majority of indigent defense in the United States is provided through a staffed public defender model, particularly in larger urban jurisdictions. More than half of the Nation's counties still use the assigned counsel model. Most States have organized some form of statewide defender services, whether in oversight, funding, or both. Some States provide statewide services for a particular kind of representation, such as appeals or capital representation. The chief defender is often selected by a commission or independent board, but many chief defenders at the State level are chosen by governors, and a few are chosen or approved by the judiciary. Conclusions on the current state of indigent defense are difficult to draw because the last comprehensive national survey of indigent defense services occurred in 1982. Although the data in the appendixes are helpful for State-byState analysis, a new comprehensive national study is now under way with Justice Department funding through the Bureau of Justice Assistance. An interim report prepared for BJA by the 19 20  National Legal Aid and Defender Association in December 1997 identified the following examples of significant changes in indigent defense since the last national survey: 1. More States have adopted a State public defender system. 2. State offices have expanded in some jurisdictions that use a hybrid of State and local defense systems. 3. The use of contract defense systems has increased in many parts of the country. 4. Defender services are expanding to address the broader needs of clients, including concepts of client-centered representation and incorporation of civil and administrative matters related to a client's case. 5. Experiments have occurred in the creation of community-based defender offices, as opposed to traditional city, county, or State agencies. 6. Defender performance guidelines have emerged that describe the tasks of representation more clearly than ever before. 7. Public defenders have made increased use of technology to share information and research and to keep case data.19 Indigent defense today, in terms of funding, caseloads, and quality, is in a chronic state of crisis.20 Indigent defense ranks consistently low on legislative agendas that focus on popular  National Legal Aid and Defender Association, National Survey of Indigent Defense System, (Interim Report, December 15, 1997), Washington, DC.

The increasing adjudication of children as adults puts new stress on indigent defense resources and creates new challenges for defenders and their criminal justice system partners to provide broader, holistic representation and services in a child's earliest encounters with the justice system. Indigent defense services suffer widely from the combined forces of weak organizational structures, heavy caseloads, underfunding relative to other components of the criminal justice system, and general political hostility to poor people facing criminal charges. The effects can be severe.  Capital defendant George McFarland's lawyer, John Benn, slept through much of his 1992 trial. ""His mouth kept falling open and his head lolled back on his shoulders . . . again. And again. And again,"" wrote a newspaper reporter. ""It's boring,"" the lawyer told the judge.21 But the constitutional right to counsel was not violated, according to the trial judge, because ""[t]he Constitution doesn't say the lawyer has to be awake."" The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals upheld McFarland's death sentence, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied review. In one California county last year, a threeattorney firm provided representation in more than 5,000 cases in 1 year under a fixed-fee contract. A single attorney was responsible for handling all misdemeanors--more than 3,500 per year, compared with the cap of 400 recommended under  national standards. The firm filed no discovery motions, took only 12 cases to trial, and retained one part-time investigator 10 hours per week. The contracting lawyer acknowledged that there is an ""inherent conflict"" that every dollar spent on an investigator or an expert means one less dollar in compensation for him, but regards this as a ""political reality.""22  In 1998, detainees in Fulton County, Georgia, waited up to a year to be indicted for simple crimes such as burglary. Defendants awaiting trial often languished for more than a year in a county jail so crowded that inmates slept shoulder to shoulder on the floor. A Federal class action suit to improve indigent defense services was settled this year. In juvenile courts across the country, children are often left literally defenseless, because overburdened juvenile defenders do not have the time or the resources to attend to the particulars of their cases. As a result, far too many children languish in the Nation's overcrowded juvenile detention and correctional facilities.      In her Law Day remarks this year, Attorney General Reno stated that ""if we do not adequately support criminal defense for poor Americans, people will think that you only get justice if you can afford to pay a lawyer. This perception would undermine confidence in our system. Skimping on adequate representation also hurts effective law enforcement by creating delays and leading to the reversal of convictions on appeal."" The Justice Department began a dialogue with the indigent defense community in September 1997, when the Attorney General and officials from OJP and BJA convened a focus group of 35  21 22  ""Asleep on the Job? Slaying Trial Boring, Lawyer Says,"" Houston Chronicle, August 14, 1992. Deposition of defendant Jack Suter in Fitzmaurice-Kendrick v. Suter, Civ. S980925 (E.D. Cal.).  6   Indigent Defense Ser vices Today  prominent representatives of the indigent defense community. The focus group identified six general themes in the field of indigent defense that must be addressed.       Advocating for indigent defense services. Building an independent indigent defense structure. Allocating resources equitably. Meeting these challenges in the juvenile justice system. Developing standards for indigent defense programs. Building the capacity for using technology.    Promoting the development of indigent defense institutions in jurisdictions where indigent defense is unstructured and reliant on ad hoc assigned counsel.  These themes have continued to guide the Justice Department's efforts to promote strong and stable indigent defense systems, including the National Symposium (see appendixes 1 and 2). When the Attorney General and OJP/BJA officials met with eight prominent indigent defense representatives in January 1998, one goal was to identify successful indigent defense programs involving collaborations of public defenders with other representatives from the criminal justice community. The group also identified major challenges to improving representation for indigent criminal defendants.  Ensuring that State and local indigent defense systems have access to Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program grants (Byrne grants), Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funds, and other Federal funds available to the various components of the criminal justice system. Managing increasing caseloads of public defenders. Providing indigent defenders with the same advanced technology available to prosecutors.  Attorney General Reno asked the Bar Information Program of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants (SCLAID) to prepare a report on collaborations between indigent defenders and other criminal justice system actors. That report was published as a BJA Indigent Defense Series monograph entitled Improving State and Local Criminal Justice Systems: A Report on How Public Defenders, Prosecutors, and Other Criminal Justice System Practitioners Are Collaborating Across the Country (October 1998). The monograph identified seven examples of collaboration in local jurisdictions: criminal justice planning commissions; cooperation in programs receiving Federal funds; task forces; Fill the Gap coalitions (i.e., the funding gap created when resources are directed to law enforcement at the start of the criminal justice process and corrections at the end, without attention to the concomitant effect on the adjudication components in the middle, such as indigent defense); joint prosecutor/public defender unions; cooperation in case tracking and criminal history systems; and fiscal impact statements. Each example was explored at the National Symposium (see appendixes 3, 4, and 5 for additional resources). In July 1998, at the request of the Attorney General's staff, The Spangenberg Group, a leading private consulting firm in the field of indigent defense, developed comprehensive, current, State-by-State data on the structure and operation of indigent defense systems in the United States (see appendixes 6 and 7). Other efforts to improve indigent defense services are already under way. Since 1993, OJJDP has funded the American Bar Association Juvenile Justice Center to conduct activities 7      National Symposium on Indigent Defense  aimed at improving the access to counsel and quality of representation that children receive in delinquency proceedings. In 1998, OJJDP provided funds to ABA to create the National Juvenile Defender Training, Technical Assistance, and Resource Center to provide ongoing support to juvenile defenders. BJA funded the Vera Institute to conduct the National Defender Leadership Project to train defender managers on leadership skills both within the criminal justice system and in the community. The Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government received an ABA grant to convene an Executive Session on Indigent Defense Systems to discuss the future direction of defense services. Against this backdrop, OJP collaboratively planned this first National Symposium on Indigent Defense. The symposium was an unprecedented gathering of participants from all components of Federal, State, and local criminal justice systems and beyond, including defenders,  prosecutors, judges, private practitioners, police, academics, legislators, court personnel, victim representatives, policy analysts, technology experts, social workers, mental health professionals, and child and family protection officials. Teams of criminal justice personnel from the same jurisdiction all spoke of the advantages of collaboration with indigent defense. This collaborative context created a unique opportunity to exchange views and showcase innovative defender programs that are taking big first steps toward bringing indigent defense into full partnership in the criminal justice system. The remainder of this report is divided into three sections. Section III uses the six priorities identified by the Office of Justice Programs focus group as the lens through which to review the sessions of the National Symposium. Section IV lists examples of successful collaborations that were presented at the symposium, and Section V provides a summary and conclusion.  8   Indigent Defense Ser vices Today  III. Expanded Strategies for Collaboration by and With Indigent Defense Systems A. A Diversity of Voices Moving Toward Consensus on Indigent Defense Knowledge about the problems facing indigent defense is not necessarily shared throughout the criminal justice and policymaking systems, but those most familiar with the problems encountered in indigent defense recognize that the issues must be addressed systemically. Dialogue can breed commonality of interest, and a recognition of symbiosis can lead to solutions. The symposium's opening plenary on ""Systemic Problem Solving"" was typical of the breadth of perspective on the problems facing indigent defense. The panel, made up of 10 participants from diverse components of the criminal justice system, responded to hypothetical questions posed by Professor Charles Ogletree from Harvard University's Law School: The panelists' answers to this problem were creative and diverse. Some, like Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer and Cook County Commissioner ""We have to make sure we don't put 100,000 police officers on the street and not increase funding for the public defenders to make sure that cases are heard and indigents are fairly represented."" --Bobbie Steele, Commissioner, Cook County, Illinois Bobbie only be port for such as Steele, saw the problem as one that could addressed by direct action through supquality indigent defense services. Others, Milwaukee District Attorney Mike  Trouble in the State of Bliss There is some consternation in the land. A few years ago there was a hue and cry to protect the interests of all citizens in the State of Bliss, because there was so much rampant crime. The legislature has gotten tough, passing many anticrime measures. More financial support has been given by the government to law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, and corrections. As a result of that support, the number of serious crimes has gone down and there's comfort in the land that the criminal justice system is working. However, we start to see some cracks because one part of the criminal justice system, the representation of indigent defendants, is exploding and about to fall apart--not enough lawyers, not enough resources, not enough training--and clients, who may or may not be guilty of the charges, are not able to raise their claims and present all of their legal issues. So, there is a crisis. Is there a way that all of these disparate parts of the criminal justice system can respond to what we see as a problem in the indigent defense system in our land? What can be done?  9   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  McCann, saw the opportunity for political compromise through support by prosecutors for indigent defense and vice versa. Others noted the broader implications of failure to support the defense component of the justice system. ""In our jurisdiction there's a very civil relationship between the defense and the prosection. . . . It is so tempting in a political campaign to rip a public defender . . . but I want to support the public defender's funding. I hope the public defender will support our funding. . . . I think there's nothing unethical in quid pro quo."" --E. Michael McCann, District Attorney, Milwaukee Wisconsin  Others noted that the failure to provide adequate defense services has an impact outside the criminal justice system as well. Cook County Commissioner Steele found links between the failure to address issues in the criminal justice system and the schools, whereas another victim advocate noted the strong generational link between drug abuse and criminal justice history, which affects families' health, housing, and education. Other influences can exacerbate the crisis. A member of the Maryland House of Delegates, Peter Franchot, candidly noted that public defense is ""at the bottom of the barrel"" in legislative priority lists but concluded his remarks by stating that he would return to the legislature that afternoon to propose additional funding for indigent defense. A law professor saw indigent defense as a means of redressing disparities between the rich and poor in criminal case processing. A crisis like the one in the State of Bliss ""would cause mayors to begin a dialogue with everyone, including our bar associations and others, to rally around our lawyers who are giving good quality work, defending those who have every right to be defended."" --Dennis Archer, Mayor, Detroit, Michigan Subsequent panels expanded upon the advantages of including indigent defense representatives in systemic discussions on criminal justice, as well as the consequences of failure to include them. Among the representatives of indigent defense were those who come from successful defender programs, often well established in local communities and State or Federal governments. Officials from throughout the criminal justice system spoke of their collaborations with indigent defense services to produce efficient and effective institutions and fairer and more just outcomes.  Eleventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Rosemary Barkett noted that constitutional protections were ""put in place not by a lobby of criminals, but by people who recognize that if we ignore some of these constitutional precepts, the things that democracy holds dear are going to be eroded."" Systemic approaches that ignore the provision of constitutionally adequate defense services are also shortsighted. A leading victims advocate from Washington, D.C., Anne Seymour, noted that intimate relationships exist between victims and offenders, however dysfunctional some of them may be. Systemic approaches find both victim and defense representatives concerned about justice. District of Columbia Police Chief Charles Ramsey noted that ""no one is served when a system breaks down. . . . There is a tendency to try to jail our way out of our problems, . . . [and] it becomes even more dysfunctional as you start to throw massive numbers of people into the system.""  10   Expanded Strategies for Collaboration by and With Indigent Defense Systems  B. Building an Independent Indigent Defense Structure The primary objective of a defender program is ""to assure that quality legal representation is afforded to all persons eligible for counsel"" (ABA Standards for Criminal Justice on Providing Defense Services, Standard 51.1). This requires that the defender function be independent--that is, able to make the appropriate decisions about the most effective means by which to defend a particular client, insulated from outside interference or political attacks motivated by public hostility to a particular client or class of clients (NAC Standard 13.9). ""The legal representation plan for a jurisdiction should be designed to guarantee the integrity of the relationship between lawyer and client,"" directs the ABA Standards on Providing Defense Services, Standard 51.3. ""The plan and the lawyers serving under it should be free from political influence and should be subject to judicial supervision only in the same manner and to the same extent as are lawyers in private practice."" The core mission of defense services programs is ""high quality, effective, and zealous advocacy for the indigent."" --Michael Judge, Chief Public Defender, Los Angeles County, California The primary means of ensuring defender independence is to provide for oversight by an independent board or commission, rather than direct oversight by judicial, legislative, or executive agencies or officials. The National Study Commission on Defense Services recommended that a special defender commission ""should be established for every defender system,"" that the ""primary consideration"" in constituting the commission ""should be the independence of the Defender Director,"" and that its membership  should include a diversity of interests and branches of government--mostly attorneys, but under no circumstances judges, prosecutors, or law enforcement (Guideline 2.10). A particularly important aspect of defender independence is budgetary: national standards require defender systems to prepare their own budgets and submit them directly to the appropriating authority, rather than allow the judicial or executive branch to cut or change them before submission (Guideline 2.8). Independence is a hallmark in the structure and operation of the Indiana Public Defender Commission, an 11-member committee that oversees some aspects of indigent defense in that State. There are two significant aspects to the commission's independence. First, its members are appointed from a sufficiently diverse community to guarantee its independence. Three are appointed by the chief justice, three by the governor, two by the speaker of the house, two by the head of the senate, and one by the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute. The political appointees must be from different political parties. Second, and more important, in a State such as Indiana, where county control is strong, the commission holds the power to reimburse, with State funds, the costs of indigent defense at the local level, at 50 percent of the costs in capital cases and 40 percent of the cost in noncapital cases. For the counties to qualify for the funding reimbursement, they must establish an independent county indigent defense board to preserve the independence of the defense function. Of the 92 counties in Indiana, 20 have chosen the funding reimbursement option, and the trend is becoming increasingly popular each year. C. Advocating for Statewide Indigent Defense Structures Some of the most effective defender collaborations have occurred in the development of new statewide systems for the delivery of defense services. The trend over time has been toward 11   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  statewide structures, whether in integrated, staffed offices or through statewide reorganization of discrete components of defense services such as central budgetary control, administrative oversight, training and other support, or specific types of representation such as appeals or death penalty cases. Statewide organization is a consistent theme of national standards. In 1967, in the wake of Gideon v. Wainwright, the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice recommended that ""each State should finance assigned counsel and defender systems on a regular and statewide basis."" In 1970, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, whose members are appointed by the governors of every State, promulgated the Model Defender Act, which recommended that every State establish a statewide defender system under the direction of a Defender General, ""to assure better coordination and consistency of approach throughout the State, [provide] better consultation with several branches of State government, . . . reduce the administrative burden on court personnel, and provide more efficient and more experienced defense counsel services to needy persons accused of crime."" The 1976 guidelines of the National Study Commission on Defense Services call for a statewide organization with a centralized administration to ""ensure uniformity and equality of legal representation and supporting services and to guarantee professional independence for individual defenders"" (Guideline 2.4). They provide that ""primary responsibility for funding of defense services should be borne at the state level"" (Guideline 2.17). ABA Standards on Providing Defense Services, Standard 51.2(c) suggests simply that ""[c]onditions may make it preferable to create a statewide system of defense."" The commentary to that section notes the trend toward statewide organization and lauds ""the flexibility of the model"" in its more recent iterations. There is substantial value in organizing defense services through some form of efficient 12  and consistently administered central program that provides cost-effective services that meet constitutional requisites for quality representation. At the National Symposium, representatives from three States spoke of diverse sources of collaboration to develop statewide defense services. In Minnesota, Nebraska, and Mississippi the processes of statewide organization were quite distinct, yet the three programs shared issues. Each dealt with different local histories and attitudes, and each approached the challenge of evolution differently. All achieved their goals. Minneapolis trial court Judge Kevin Burke and Minnesota's Chief Administrator of Indigent Defense Services Richard Scherman described the transition to State structures. In the mid1980s, only 2 of the State's 10 judicial districts and 2 of the largest urban areas had separate public defender agencies. The main reason for considering a switch to a statewide system was the risk of a long, serious criminal trial in a small county, because all counties financed their operations with local property taxes, which produced a relatively small budgetary base. In addition to financial considerations, those who promoted statewide organization argued for longevity and stability in the program, as well as an identifiable mission. They promoted State financing as the first step toward funding of a State-integrated justice system. For a legislative champion, they approached a legislator with a teaching background, who had no knowledge of defender systems but was concerned about equal treatment and understood the financial aspects of State services. Years of effort resulted in legislation establishing the Minnesota Board of Public Defense, with three nonattorney members appointed by the governor and four members appointed by the State supreme court. The board is an independent agency under the judicial branch's budget. The program now has 5 ""public defense corporations"" with 720 employees, a $48 million annual budget   Expanded Strategies for Collaboration by and With Indigent Defense Systems  from the State legislature, and 200,000 cases annually. About 65 percent of employees are part time, but all are paid full State benefits. A notable collaboration within the program is between attorney and nonattorney staff. The State public defender, a lawyer, oversees operations and deals with legislation. A nonlawyer administrator deals with personnel and budgets. Key collaborations contributing to the Minnesota program's success include building a broad political base of support with local commissioners in the counties, working with local county organizations, working with unions (the State's staff defenders are unionized), tying technology to other statewide systems such as the courts, and working in collaboration with prosecutors and the media. In Nebraska, the coalition for creation of a State public defender office involved a nationally known senior partner in a large law firm, Harold Rock of the Omaha firm Kutak Rock, and Federal funding through the Byrne formula grant program to study the development of a statewide defender system. The impetus for reform was provided by several lengthy trials in unexpected major cases in a small rural county. A task force to study the possibility of starting a State-funded public defender program began with Mr. Rock as chair. The task force had representation from the State bar association, the county commissioners, the State legislature, and judges from all levels of the courts. The task force engaged a consulting firm in the field of indigent defense services, The Spangenberg Group, to design a study of indigent defense in the State. The study, which included a survey of various justice system actors, totaled 150 pages and was submitted with legislative recommendations to the Nebraska Supreme Court. James Mowbray, director of the Nebraska Commission on Public Advocacy, the statewide body that eventually resulted from the Spangenberg report, told National Symposium attendees that the report had found ""some good  offices"" but, ""generally, a very dysfunctional system."" The advantage of using an outside consulting firm was that it presented a report with ""credibility and data"" to Nebraska judges and legislators. In approaching the legislature, the task force decided that the ""right to effective assistance of counsel"" argument, although constitutionally compelling, would carry little weight in convincing legislators of the wisdom of statewide financing and organization. Instead of taking its bill to the Judiciary Committee, the task force took it to the Revenue Committee, where it was called the ""County Revenue Assistance Act."" The bill passed the legislature handily because it provided property tax relief to the counties. The Nebraska Commission on Public Advocacy was proposed to defend only first-degree capital murder charges, which are still its only charge. However, with additional Byrne grant funds, the commission was able to fund additional attorney positions to help the counties with other serious violent felony and drug offenses. The program's budget is under the executive branch of the State government. In Mississippi, where the battle for State funding began almost 10 years ago, two key actors were former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice James L. Robertson and the public defender in Jackson County, Mississippi, Beth Davis, who now serves as the executive director of the new State system for indigent defense. Work on a statewide system began in earnest in the wake of a 1991 decision by the Mississippi Supreme Court in State v. Wilson, 574 So.2d 1338 (Miss. S.C. 1991). That decision found both the structure and funding of indigent defense in Mississippi to be inadequate. By statute, the maximum fee for any court-appointed criminal case was $1,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses, and there were ""plenty of circuit judges,"" Justice Robertson told symposium attendees, ""who prided themselves on never approving the full $1,000."" When the court effectively struck down the fee maximum, he said, ""many counties were 13   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  hit with five-figure bills from court-appointed lawyers."" In 1993, the Mississippi Judicial Advisory Study Committee, working under the mandate of the State legislature, named a subcommittee to explore alternatives to the structure and funding of indigent defense services in the State. At the same time, the Mississippi Criminal Defense Lawyers Association used State bar IOLTA money to fund a statewide study by The Spangenberg Group, similar to the study done for Nebraska. A major issue for the committee was who would be in charge of any proposed State agency. Thus, the composition of the board that would select and oversee the State's public defender was crucial. Ultimately, the State ended up with a nine-member board with ""each person appointed by a separate public official or constituency,"" including the Mississippi Bar Association, the Magnolia Bar Association (an AfricanAmerican lawyers association), and the Public Defenders Association. The State Defender Office was organized on July 1, 1998. According to Ms. Davis, executive director of the Office of the Mississippi State Defender, much of the early success of the defender's office can be attributed to participation in the Vera Institute's National Defender Leadership Project. There she met and collaborated with public defenders with similar programs and problems. The importance of pay parity for public defender, to ""attract the brightest and youngest people to come into this system and lend us their talent, their intelligence, and their enthusiasm"" was stressed at the Leadership Project. Each of these three successful collaborations in the creation of statewide systems was developed through different processes, and the resultant organizations differ in structure and scope of services. However, these States' experiences share four aspects in common. First, each moved to a statewide structure under the guidance of a diverse planning body. Second, each State began 14  its mission out of a local funding crisis, whether that crisis was a criminal trial that could or did bankrupt smaller counties or a severe funding shortage requiring judicial intervention. Third, each State conducted a systematic study of defense services, using outside consultants, before moving into the legislative arena. Finally, when legislative action was called for, each State knew which arguments would most likely persuade its legislators to adequately fund defense services. D. Allocating Resources Equitably Salaries in public defender offices have historically suffered by comparison with those of prosecutors, other State employees or contractors performing similar legal work, and the private bar. Salary parity between prosecutors and defenders at all experience levels is an important means of reducing staff turnover and avoiding related recruitment/training costs and disruptions to the office and case processing. Concomitant with salary parity is the need to maintain comparable staffing and workloads--the notion of equal pay for equal work. The concept of parity includes all related resource allocations, including support, investigative and expert services, physical facilities such as a law library, computers, and proximity to the courthouse, as well as institutional ""In the National District Attorney's Association (NDAA), we are looking to get some rolling back of student loans for public service, and we have included public defenders in our proposal."" --William Murphy, Prosecutor and Immediate Past President, NDAA  issues such as access to Federal grant programs and student loan forgiveness options. National standards affirm these principles. ABA Standards on Providing Defense Services, Standard 54.1   Expanded Strategies for Collaboration by and With Indigent Defense Systems  states: ""The chief defender and staff should be compensated at the rate commensurate with their experience and skill sufficient to attract career personnel and comparable to that provided for their counterparts in prosecutorial offices."" This standard recognizes that all employees in the office are entitled to parity, that skill and experience should be compensated adequately, that short-term employment is a drain on any office, and that prosecutorial salaries are the best measures against which to compare the pay rates and scale in the public defender program. ABA Standard 51.4 makes clear that, in addition to attorney salaries, adequate resources should be provided for investigatory, expert, and other services necessary to quality legal representation, not only at trial but ""in every phase of the [criminal] process."" Both ABA Standard 54.3 and the National Study Commission Guideline 3.4 call for adequate facilities and other material, including technology, to permit quality representation. ""Indigent defense services could be funded as a percentage of the total amount we spend for some other component of the criminal justice system, such as prosecution or prisons."" --Ron Goldstock, Former Prosecutor and Immediate Past Chair, ABA Criminal Justice Section  the timing of payment. Panelists observed that no comprehensive formula yet exists for calculating true comparability of resources for both sides in a criminal case. Federal public defenders generally have salary parity with Federal prosecutors. By statute, they are to be paid at a rate not to exceed prosecutors' salaries; salaries of assistant Federal defenders are set by the Defender Services Division of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts at levels ""consistent with"" comparable positions in U.S. Attorney's Offices. The Defender Services Division, a 30-person office with an annual appropriation of about $400 million, coordinates all Federal indigent defense programs. It administers a budget and grant process for about 100 Federal public defender programs across the country. In recent years, the division began a project called the Defender Organization Classification System, which set pay levels for qualifications and standards for all types of positions in Federal defender offices. The Federal public defender program authorizes staffing on a caseload-per-attorney basis, and caseloads are based on the number of cases closed by each attorney in a given year. Caseloads of the staff attorneys in the program vary widely, from as few as 35 closed cases per year to as many as 300. A proposed weighted caseload system for Federal defenders seeks an average of from 65 to 90 case closings per attorney, per year. Payment levels for private attorneys appointed to represent indigent Federal defendants in Federal cases, however, whether measured against attorneys in private practice or against rates that the Federal Government pays for work other than indigent defense, are significantly low. The rate for private attorneys appointed to criminal cases in the Federal system is generally $45 an hour for out-of-court time and $65 for the 1 out of 6 hours on an average case that are spent in court. Average law office overhead in the Nation, however, is about $57 per hour. Attorney General  Symposium panelists recognized that defining the scope of and limits on parity can be difficult. Parity can apply to attorney and nonattorney staff, to entry-level salaries and salaries for experienced staff, and to assigned counsel and contract rates of pay. It may apply to staffing, staffing ratios (attorneys to support staff or attorneys to investigators), or caseloads. It may be affected by such procedural questions as the source of payment (State or county funding, for example), the capping of payments at a certain maximum, or  15   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  Reno recently urged Congress to provide funding for an across-the-board $75 hourly rate, as Congress itself authorized 15 years ago but never fully funded. In addition to the issue of hourly fees, compensation for Federally appointed counsel is further limited by a $3,500 presumptive case maximum, or cap, in felony cases and by similar caps on investigative expenses and appeals (see appendix 9). Other programs have struggled successfully with parity issues. The Office of the Public Defender of the State of Connecticut has dollarfor-dollar parity with prosecutors' salaries, as described by the State's Chief Public Defender Gerard Smyth. The State legislative debate on this issue reflected the concern that paying public defenders less than prosecutors may pose a constitutional problem. Parity is based on a rough staffing formula by which the public defender is allocated two-thirds the number of staff positions that prosecutors' offices have. Prosecutor salaries are determined by union negotiations, then endorsed by the Public Defender Commission. In New Mexico, the State Public Defender Department was suffering significant attrition when its attorneys took prosecution and other government jobs because the office could not maintain parity. The attrition rate in the Albuquerque felony unit exceeded 50 percent of the 30 felony attorneys in a single year. State Public Defender Phyllis Subin began meeting regularly with the governor's chief of staff and working with the State personnel office and personnel board to develop a market-pricing study of pay scales for all other State lawyers. She hired an Assistant Public Defender with a Master's degree in public administration and a human resources officer who had just left the State personnel office. Together they developed additional market-pricing studies vis-a-vis the private bar in New Mexico and public defenders in neighboring States. The legislature took note of the program's cost-effectiveness as well as the destabilizing  effect and case backlogs across the whole criminal justice system caused by public defender turnover. The legislature ultimately enacted the Balanced Justice Act, providing that, whenever a new judgeship is created, staffing must be comparably increased in the public defender and district attorney offices. E. Meeting Systemic Challenges in the Juvenile Justice System Any successful criminal justice system must include a firm commitment to a comprehensive program of juvenile justice, with sufficient resources allocated for performance of the defense function. Effective intervention with troubled young people can yield lasting benefits in their lives and save the system from the enormous costs and time of dealing with those same people in the adult courts and correctional systems. Panels on ""Client-centered lawyering works for the client, who sees himself as somebody worth fighting for; it works for the criminal justice system when the public has confidence that our young people are being adequately represented and fairly treated; and it works for public safety because it translates into less crime."" --Jo-Ann Wallace, Director, Public Defender Service Washington, D.C. juvenile justice noted the dramatic shifts in the issue of indigent defense in the juvenile justice system in recent years. John J. Wilson, the deputy administrator of the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, noted that the stakes are higher now for juvenile offenders than ever before, with some 17,000 juveniles transferred to adult criminal courts every year. He drew on findings of an OJJDP study  16   Expanded Strategies for Collaboration by and With Indigent Defense Systems  conducted by the ABA and published in 1995, A Call for Justice, which concluded that ""significant numbers of juveniles were being incarcerated without benefit of counsel . . . [and] that many juveniles were not receiving the quality of representation to which they were entitled."" The resource issues for juvenile defenders are most dramatically posed in the study's conclusion which stated that the most pervasive problem in juvenile defense is ""exceedingly high caseloads, with some attorneys carrying 500 cases a year, 300 of which are juvenile cases."" Fees for assigned counsel in juvenile cases, too, are a feature of inadequate resources. Maximum fees of $100 for appointed counsel to handle any juvenile case in Virginia, for example, are lower than the adult misdemeanor fee cap of $132 per case. Defender programs for young people also suffer from difficulty in the recruitment and retention of staff attorneys who can provide their juvenile clients with capable, compassionate representation. The New York Legal Aid Society recently reformed its entire organization to more effectively serve its clients. Under the leadership of Columbia Law School Professor Jane Spinak, and with advice from an outside consulting firm, each Juvenile Rights Division (JRD) office in the five boroughs of New York reorganized itself into what were called ""delinquency teams."" Teams were composed of the attorneys, social workers, support staff, and parents of JRD clients. ""What that meant,"" said Professor Spinak, ""was that there was greater joint staff decisionmaking; there was clearer identification of client needs; and there was greater openness to a team model of representation to identifying what the lawyers do, what the social workers do, what parents can do, what support staff does."" The lawyer team members sought more training, and the appeals unit of the office provided backup, especially on delinquency issues, thereby permitting the office to bring back greater use of impact litigation. Perhaps the strongest sign of its success was that  the new JRD design was later emulated by family court judges as a model for court restructuring. JRD also presented another aspect of resource collaboration in juvenile defense. Working with the law schools at New York and Columbia Universities, JRD is collaborating on employing law students from clinical programs in innovative ways. Whereas students normally work on a single case or small numbers of cases in a typical clinical program, the focal point of this experimental collaboration, said Monica Drinane, Professor Spinak's successor at JRD, ""is to learn what a public interest law practice is and also to be doing things that help the public interest lawyers manage their large caseloads more effectively and comprehensively."" A new collaboration with juvenile defenders is being forged by the Department of Justice's Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division. The Special Litigation Section works under two mandates regarding juveniles: the 20year-old Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. 1997 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. 14141 (see appendix 12). There are more than 1,000 juvenile detention and correctional facilities nationwide, according to Section Deputy Director Robinson Frohboese, with more than 0.5 million juveniles detained in the past year. Two-thirds of these juveniles are minority children, a proportion vastly in excess of their representation in the Nation's population. Some 60 to 70 percent have mental health needs of some sort, and the vast majority come from low-income families. With 21 attorneys, the Special Litigation Section is stretched thin with current investigations of juvenile facilities in 8 jurisdictions and active monitoring of settlement agreements in 66 facilities. In Louisiana, the section is actively involved in conditions litigation in four secure confinement juvenile facilities, including the Tallulah  17   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  Correctional Center for Youth in Madison. The director of the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, who is working with the section on the Tallulah litigation, noted that ""Louisiana now has the distinction of being the only State in the country where Justice had to actually file a lawsuit under CRIPA."" The section is also in the preliminary stages of exploring the use of Federal law to identify the inadequacy of defense representation for juveniles. Although exploratory at the time of the National Symposium, such litigation, were it to occur, would be part of an increasing number of litigative challenges to the systemic inadequacy of indigent defense services, but the first such systemic litigation to be pursued by Federal prosecutors. Another effective collaboration for juvenile defense is the use of mental health experts with special expertise in working with children. A clinical psychologist who often collaborates with defenders in juvenile cases, Marty Beyer, told symposium attendees that juvenile competency is not the same as that of adults, which is only based on mental illness or low IQ. Instead, juvenile incompetency may be based on immaturity, including children's ""lack of long-range perspective; their difficulty in seeing more than one choice at a time; their problems in trusting adults; their moral code that says the absolute wrong thing to do is to snitch, which is just an adolescent loyalty form of morality; their serious misunderstandings of defense counsel's role; their not seeing legal rights as entitlements because of childhood experiences; and their learning disabilities."" Dr. Beyer urged a ""reframing"" of arguments by child advocates. When children return again and again to juvenile court, she suggested, attention should be given not only to the child but to the lack of services that followed previous arrests. Steve Harper, creator of the Sentencing Advocacy Project for juveniles in Miami, Florida, urged 18  deeper collaborations of defenders with psychologists. Defenders need to use mental health experts before trial, not only to help them evaluate their juvenile clients, but to advocate. The clinical expert can go with the defender to the prosecutor's office to explain the full psychological framework of the accused juvenile to the prosecutor. Additional innovative approaches to enhancing resources and building collaborations in the juvenile justice area are discussed in Section IV, Collaborations: Indigent Defense as a Full Partner in the Criminal Justice System, including coordinated transfer of juveniles to adult criminal courts in the Baltimore Youthful Defender Unit; holistic sentencing advocacy for children in Miami; early entry of social workers in the Maryland Detention Response Unit; and postadjudication advocacy for children in Kentucky. F. Developing Standards for Indigent Defense Programs National standards for indigent defense are comprehensive, dealing with virtually every aspect of representation, as well as the recommended structures for defense services. State and local jurisdictions increasingly have adopted their own versions of standards for defense representation and defense systems, much as local ethical and disciplinary rules are adopted from national models (see appendix 8). However, many State and local indigent defense systems either have ""You've got to have enough confidence in yourself and in your office to say that we are as good as you all. And we are going to be a part of this, and you've got to treat us as equals, and they eventually will."" --Karl Dean, Public Defender, Nashville, Tennessee   Expanded Strategies for Collaboration by and With Indigent Defense Systems  not adopted local standards or have not taken full advantage of those standards that do exist. The first national standards for indigent defense were developed almost 30 years ago by the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, appointed by Attorney General Richard Kleindeinst. Those standards were followed by the publication of the Institute for Judicial Administration/American Bar Association Standards Relating to Juvenile Justice. Dennis Keefe, Lancaster County public defender in Lincoln, Nebraska, and chair of the Bar Information Project of the American Bar Association, noted that although national standards are not binding on any State or local programs, national and local standards have served widely as both ""minimums"" and ""models"" in court decisions, statutes, court rules, and indigent defense service contracts. The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in the 1970s required any applicant for indigent defense funding to implement the requirements of Argersinger v. Hamlin, the U.S. Supreme Court case extending the right to counsel to any misdemeanor case involving a potential loss of liberty, and follow the caseload standards of the National Advisory Commission. In 1998, an ABA resolution called upon all States, bar associations, and courts to adopt enforceable standards relating to the operations of indigent defense systems and to make substantial compliance with those standards a necessary predicate to funding. A good example of the effective use of standards is in Indiana. The Indiana Public Defender Commission proposed, and the State supreme court adopted, a rule on capital defense, Indiana Criminal Rule of Procedure 24, which drew heavily from prevailing national standards on the provision of defense services in capital cases. As explained by Indiana Law School Dean Norman Lefstein, chair of the Public Defender Commission, the rule requires two qualified attorneys and sets forth experiential requirements for lead counsel as well as co-counsel. It also requires  continuing legal education (CLE) for capital defense representation, with a minimum of 12 hours of experience within 2 years of the date of appointment. A special duty is imposed on judges to assess the defense lawyers' workload to determine whether the lawyer can handle the capital case, and the lawyer is also required to assess workload. A public defender cannot be appointed in a capital case if the defender, at any time during the pendency of the capital case, has more than 20 open felony cases, and no felony case can be set for trial within 30 days of the date of trial in a capital case. Lawyers are paid $70 an hour, in and out of court, with no cap on fees, and counsel must be provided with adequate funds for investigative, expert, and other services necessary to prepare and present an adequate defense, including the sentencing phase. In Indiana, as discussed above, compliance with standards is a condition of State funding in both capital and noncapital cases. G. Building a Capacity for Using Technology Case management, computerization, and technology issues all are aspects of long-term program stability for indigent defense services and are increasingly critical to the fast, efficient, and cost-effective processing of cases--not only by the defender program but by the criminal justice system. A significant problem is that many defender programs lack technology altogether. This section describes some of the innovations in technology by indigent defense programs and summarizes new partnerships between defenders and other justice system components. Significant technology innovation and assistance comes from the Federal Government. OJP General Counsel Paul Kendall described a major OJP initiative to develop an intergovernmental justice information protocol that would permit information sharing among all components of the criminal justice system. Indigent defense services are included because the Omnibus Crime Control 19   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  and Safe Streets Act defines ""criminal justice"" as ""activities of the courts having criminal jurisdiction and related agencies, including, but not limited to prosecutorial and defender services."" Today, OJP spending on technology integration has three targets identified by Attorney General Reno. First, it seeks a greater measure of cooperation between Federal, State, and local governments and private industry. Second, it seeks to prevent ""smokestack"" development, whereby isolated and unlinked efforts of individual agencies occur but no information is shared among agencies or across jurisdictions. Third, it draws attention to privacy and security concerns as systems grow larger and more integrated. The overall objective is to improve the effectiveness and fairness of the criminal justice system through better information sharing.  staff, they found duplicate data entry was frequent and delays in information transfer were chronic. Their solution was to put out bids for a computer company to provide the whole system with hardware and software that would eliminate duplicate data entry, increase accuracy of information, and make the system run smoother. The initial contract, signed in October 1994, was for nearly $6 million. Three basic components exist in the system now. There is a module, or data packet, for the sheriff 's department, the clerk, the State attorney, the public defender, and the corrections department. Access to data in the system is provided to each agency based on its role in the criminal justice process; some information may be kept confidential based on role division. The public defender office has added systems for conflicts checks and mental health issues. The system permits the sheriff to enter standard data every time a person is arrested. After using those data, posted to networked computers, to conduct intake at the State Attorney's Office, the information is passed through the network to the public defender's office, where the intake staff can click on the entered data. The office decides whether to accept the case for assignment and, if accepted, passes the file on to the attorney's desktop computer. A single body of baseline data is consistently kept throughout this process. Future possibilities include the use of scanned documents and electronic signature, which would significantly reduce paper pleadings. H. Establishing Case Management Case management approaches in defender programs can vary widely. The approaches to case management and work overload in New York City's Legal Aid Society and Miami's Dade County Public Defender programs could not be more different. One of the most sophisticated case management systems in a large defender office is that of the Legal Aid Society of New York, which, despite its size and longevity, has only recently  ""Information technology has changed and will continue to change the paradigm of our current notions of the practice of law. It will change your office and the criminal justice system in almost every way imaginable."" --Jeff Gale, Chief Deputy State Public Defender of California  In addition to nationally coordinated efforts of technology collaboration, local programs have shown great skill and creativity in implementing technology integration. In the 12th Judicial Circuit in Sarasota, Florida, as described at the symposium by Toby Hockett, chief assistant public defender, and Janice Lovern, executive director, State Attorney's Office, who collaborated on the project at the request of the chief judge of the circuit, meetings began with the circuit's court clerk, the sheriff, the State attorney, and the public defender (see appendix 10). Their mission was more efficient operations through systemic approaches. After surveying the office 20   Expanded Strategies for Collaboration by and With Indigent Defense Systems  begun systematic development of a predictive case-weighting system. The model was developed because of two significant shifts in the organization's structure in the past 5 years: a downward spiral of funding in a competitive market for defense services and a dramatic shift in the office's caseload toward misdemeanors. The Legal Aid Society maintained data that counted and minimally tracked only assignments and dispositions of over 2 million cases during the prior 10-year period, but it needed a system that would permit predictive decisionmaking for staffing and budgetary purposes. The Legal Aid Society decided to track three primary elements of cases: first, the size of the entire pool of indigent defendants in New York City; second, the number of anticipated misdemeanor and felony arraignments that went to the office from that pool; and third, its staffing resources to deal with those assignments. Michelle Maxian, attorney-in-charge, Criminal Division, called the resulting system ""an interactive computer model that is premised on variable assumptions and actual past performance for the past 3 years that predicts, within a range of reliability, what our intake and caseload will be for the next 12 months."" That information is available for estimates of anything from one attorney's caseload to estimates of caseloads for the entire division of 400 lawyers. She noted that any system that is developed must be simple. ""The more sophisticated your use of the data, the less related it is to what I can ballpark as a manager . . . . And to the extent that it seems unreal, it also seems unreliable to me."" With the new system in place, David Newhouse, an outside consultant working on computer issues in the office, noted that the office was able to anticipate that if it had 4 ""fully certified"" felony attorneys in court every day, those attorneys would pick up an average of 4.6 felonies and 5.4 misdemeanors per day. Although there are some seasonal variations in caseload  and some distortions caused by particular events such as higher arrest rates in some locations, the system is accurate over time. The new system has been operating for about a year. During the last fiscal year, estimates were accurate to within 3 or 4 percentage points when compared with the actual work of the office. Bennett Brummer, the public defender for Dade County, Miami, Florida, had a more hardline perspective on case management. ""What works out there,"" he argued, ""is raw political power."" From his perspective, case management must be seen from both the management and litigation points of view. His response to case overload, when it first occurred in 1989, was to visit the chief judge of his circuit and ask the judge what to do with the excess cases that his office could no longer handle. Although that request resulted in new staffing for the office, the problem of case overload continued. He returned to the judge with the same issue, and this time told the judge that his office would have to consider motions to withdraw due to case overload. Although the judge ultimately must decide the limits on caseload, the threat of litigation may be necessary to accomplish caseload limits. This view comports with prevailing national standards, which contemplate refusal of additional appointments. Standard 55.3 of the ABA Standards on Providing Defense Services says that defenders ""must take such steps as may be appropriate to reduce their pending or projected caseloads, including the refusal of further appointments"" when that caseload ""will lead to the furnishing of representation lacking in quality or to the breach of professional obligations."" The commentary to that standard states that in a defender program with excessive workload, ""additional cases must be refused and, if necessary, pending cases transferred to assigned counsel."" National Study Commission Guideline 5.1 urges setting maximum pending workload limits for defender offices, with suggested criteria to  21   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  determine if workload is excessive. Drastic steps such as refusal of appointments, withdrawal from pending cases, or the threat of litigation on  caseloads have sometimes been the last resort of severely overloaded defender services programs.  22   Expanded Strategies for Collaboration by and With Indigent Defense Systems  IV. Collaborations: Indigent Defense as a Full Partner in the Criminal Justice System Several initiatives have attempted to make the best use of limited justice system resources by implementing projects that depend on collaborative interagency planning. This section provides descriptions of successful programs. A. Criminal Justice Coordinating Committees: Los Angeles County, California, and Fulton County, Georgia The Los Angeles County Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee was created by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1981 to provide a forum for improving the efficiency and the effectiveness of the justice system by bringing together leaders from each of its components. The committee's 40 members include traditional actors in the criminal justice system as well as city officials, educators, directors of the mental health and alcohol and drug programs, and representatives from Federal law enforcement agencies (see appendix 15). The committee operates in one of the largest urban jurisdictions in the United States. The 5member county board of supervisors controls an annual budget authority of more than $13 billion. Michael P. Judge, chief public defender for the County of Los Angeles, runs a countywide operation with 40 offices and more than 600 lawyers; the chair of the board acts as his immediate supervisor. The Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee, in turn, operates with about 30 different subcommittees and working groups. Representatives from the public defender office serve on all of these subcommittees. The public defender's office has held a seat on the committee since its inception. In describing his vision for the role of indigent defense representatives in the committee's operations, Mr. Judge said that he seeks ""a dynamic kind of collaboration, the notion that the public defender can and should be a leader in the process, bringing our values and perspectives to the criminal justice initiatives that do occur. My vision is not to expand my office unless it's absolutely necessary. My vision is to achieve better outcomes."" Mr. Judge believes that the committee's best program has been the drug treatment program run in conjunction with the drug courts. The role is not the classic adversarial one for the defenders, but the design of drug court permits defenders to be, in Mr. Judge's words, ""responsible for life outcomes."" He points to the fact that Los Angeles developed the quickest settlement rate in drug felonies in the Nation, in some instances within 2 days of arrest. The quick settlement allows clients to gain access to diversion and treatment programs that provide longer term solutions for them. The defender office also was able to have an effective impact on a diversion program from the three-strikes law in California. Another recent success came in the area of domestic violence courts. The public defender program obtained a grant to hire licensed clinical social workers to identify community-based resources and gain access to them for the office's clients. The committee also provided a forum for the public defender to resist undesirable initiatives, such as proposals for nonunanimous and 6-person juries, elimination of juries in cases with a punishment of 6 months or less, professional jurors, and a proposed option for prosecutors to eliminate the potential of jail time from lesser misdemeanors, which would therefore eliminate  23   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  not only the right to a jury but also the right to a counsel. The justice system budget for Fulton County, Georgia, is the largest aggregate budget in the county (see appendix 16). What became the Fulton County Justice System Coordinating Committee, however, grew not from a general effort to coordinate the various components of the justice system, as in Los Angeles, but from a single issue: shortcomings in the public defender office. Steve Kinnard, now chief circuit mediator for the 11th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals in Atlanta, served from 1991 to 1998 as facilitator for a group that became known, in 1995, as the Fulton County Justice System Coordinating Committee. In October 1990, an outside consulting group came in at the request of the Fulton County Superior Court and the county manager to analyze and write a report on the operations of the public defender program of Fulton County. The report concluded that the indigent defense system was ""disjointed and fragmented, there was a lack of communication and coordination among the various agencies, the attorney caseloads were way too high, and the office was underfunded."" It urged an emergency appropriation for the office and appointment of a Blue Ribbon Committee by the president of the Atlanta Bar Association to look into the situation and make further recommendations. The Fulton County Justice Commission was the result of those efforts. The commission had 21 members, named by the Atlanta Bar Association. In March 1991, it began its work, meeting not only about the public defender's office but also about Fulton County criminal justice issues in general. It met with the county commissioners, noting that the public defender office's budget at the time was less than $1.8 million. The county commissioners told the commission to go to the State for funding, an effort that proved unsuccessful. However, the commission's local negotiations with the Budget 24  Subcommittee of the County Commission resulted in a 1992 budget that raised salaries of all public defenders. Over time, the budget increases for the public defender program continued, and today the office's budget has climbed to about $5.5 million. Between 1992 and 1995, a growing group of criminal justice officials, known as the Fulton County Justice System Ad Hoc Committee, continued to meet monthly to discuss budgets for the public defender and justice system operations in general. ""People began to understand the problems of the other components,"" Mr. Kinnard noted. ""They began to develop a common language."" No such dialogue had taken place before in the justice system, particularly between public officials and criminal justice participants. In October 1995, the Fulton County Justice System Coordinating Committee was institutionalized to implement a master plan for the county's justice system. The new coordinating committee, now made up of representatives from 19 city, county, and State agencies, publishes press advisories and a monthly newsletter and is developing a comprehensive case management system with outside consultants. It has developed various teams studying preindictment issues, postindictment issues, clerk's office support, forms, data management and information, and backlog reduction. During the past year, the committee allocated approximately $2 million for a new pretrial services unit and another $2 million for a new complaint room for the prosecutor's office. The program received its full budget request of $19.6 million for fiscal year 1999, after receiving only $4.2 million of an $8 million request in 1998. The committee has attracted more than $28 million for new projects to date, 96 percent of which are locally funded. B. Defending Juveniles Charged as Adults: Maryland and Chicago Juvenile transfer to adult courts experienced a precipitous rise in the past decade. In the past   Collaborations: Indigent Defense as a Full Par tner in the Criminal Justice System  8 years, 40 States expanded transfer, lowered the age for transfer, or expanded the categories of offenses making juveniles eligible for transfer to or for original jurisdiction in the adult court. The State of Maryland and the city of Chicago have developed successful collaboration strategies to deal with this trend. The Youthful Defender Unit in the Maryland State Public Defender Office in Baltimore was created in July 1995 and is staffed by two attorneys. It was created when Maryland law was changed to require that a much broader category of juveniles be prosecuted in the adult courts. In attempting a systematic response to the problem, the original goal of the unit was total vertical representation--that is, once one of its lawyers becomes involved in a juvenile case, that lawyer follows it wherever it goes, throughout the adult or juvenile process. The unit's attorneys are allowed discretion in limiting caseload to permit the movement with cases that vertical representation requires. Collaboration with others in this newly revised process grew out of another mandate to the Youthful Defender Unit. The unit was charged with examining the process by which new cases were being handled, and if defects or shortcomings in the system were discovered the unit's supervisor, David Addison, was allowed to work on those issues as well. As Mr. Addison worked in the system, he discovered that there were significant delays in the process of consideration of motions to transfer cases out of the adult courts and back to juvenile court. To attack the problem, he had an undergraduate intern from Johns Hopkins University develop a timeline of how long it took for each link in the consideration of such motions to be accomplished. If the law had been followed, 2 months should be required from the time the case came to circuit court until it was ready for a transfer hearing. The study showed, however, that the actual time was 7 months to 1 year. This was a serious shortcoming;  time is crucial when dealing with juveniles because one of the criteria for deciding whether transfer is appropriate is age and delays work to the prejudice of clients who may age a year before being heard. As a result of the unit's findings, the Ad Hoc Task Force on Juvenile Transfers was created. The task force was made up of Mr. Addison, the judge in charge of the Criminal Division, and representatives from the Medical Services Office, the Department of Juvenile Justice, the clerk's office, and the State Attorney's Office, particularly its Juvenile Court Division. Working together, the group members came up with several innovations. First, they devised a standard motion to trigger the request for transfer. Second, they modified the form used by the Medical Services Office to include more useful information for them and for other recipients of the report. Third, all motions were filed directly with the judge, rather than with the clerk, so that copies could be sent from there to the clerk, the Department of Juvenile Justice, and the Medical Services Office. In certain expedited situations involving vulnerable juveniles detained in adult facilities, the process of transfer to a juvenile facility can be completed in as few as 7 days. In Chicago, there are two significant difficulties in getting information about children threatened with transfer to adult proceedings, according to Carl Bell, a psychiatrist and president of the Community Mental Health Council. First, the juveniles are likely to have multiple problems and may be involved with several agencies such as public health, family services, police departments, and schools. The problem of getting accurate and complete information about children for court assessments by doctors is daunting. Second, the reports that are provided by social services and psychiatric evaluative personnel are often filled with what Dr. Bell called ""psycho-babble"" and are not helpful to the court in assessing a course of action.  25   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  Dr. Bell suggested two collaborations for defenders: to work closely with mental health centers and schools of psychology to get better evaluations of their clients and to work with treatment providers to develop alternatives to punishment for children. In Chicago, defenders and doctors are linking clients with specially trained youth officers--not line police officers but people trained in children's issues and vested with significant discretion to implement programs with public schools, probation, social services, mental health, and family services. When the child leaves the police department, someone will follow up to make sure that the child and his or her family receive useful services. According to Dr. Bell, research shows that such linkages help prevent the child from repeated delinquent behavior. C. The Arizona Fill the Gap Program Arizona began its Fill the Gap Program in 1997. The ""gap"" refers to a gap that has developed in resources and programs for the criminal justice system's middle component--the courts, prosecutors, defenders, clerks, and other adjudication system employees--in the face of recent major infusions of State and Federal funding for the beginning and end of the system--police and corrections. Extra funding at both ends of the system leaves the middle weakened (see appendix 13). Judges organized an initial meeting about the project with the Attorney General's Office, the county attorneys, the public defender office, and the judges and their clerks. Group members first discussed their common problems, then devised a plan to go to the Arizona legislature for additional funding. They proposed a program that would appropriate $19.5 million from the general fund to ""reengineer"" the court system in all counties and reduce case-processing time. The overloaded Arizona courts found that the average time to process a case from arrest to trial  had increased from a statewide average of 195 days in 1991 to an average of 290 days in 1977. The goal of the Fill the Gap Program was to reduce the average time to trial to fewer than 100 days for 90 percent of the cases and to 180 days for the remaining 10 percent. Case delay, it was argued, affects all of the actors in the criminal court. Defendants languish in overcrowded facilities with no treatment or rehabilitation; victims are affected by increased stress and frustration from lengthy waits for outcomes; prosecutors, defenders, and court workers are plagued by excessive caseloads; and court clerks drown in a sea of paperwork, averaging 25,000 pages of new documents a day in Maricopa County alone. And the cost to taxpayers for additional time of incarceration of those awaiting trial is approximately $40 a day for each inmate. The legislature rejected the program's large funding request and instead provided initial funding for the program of about $350,000, permitting it to proceed in 7 counties. Arizona Supreme Court Justice Charles Jones gave an example of what reengineering would look like in a typical county. First, it required a commitment of cooperation and hard work among all of the criminal justice agencies. Second, an expert consultant was retained to help the judges with case management. Third, firm dates were established for significant events in each case, which were to change only under ""extreme good cause."" Justice Jones asserted that these dates were held firm while still maintaining constitutional protections for criminal defendants. Meg Wuebbels, from the Maricopa County Public Defender's Office, noted that although the trial rate in her office had gone up dramatically in each month, the win rate in the office held steady at about 40 percent after commencement of the new system. Fourth, systems were automated to provide all participants with consistent, more current information. Justice Jones noted that the average number of days served prior to trial dropped from 173 to  26   Collaborations: Indigent Defense as a Full Par tner in the Criminal Justice System  55 in Coconino County over a 4-year period. But he concluded that there are obvious limitations to what reengineering can do without the broader financial and human resources necessary to improve the court system in all respects and that ensuring funding for the Fill the Gap Program is always a challenge. D. Public Defenders and Drug Courts: Montana, California, Connecticut, Florida, and Oregon Public defenders from Montana, California, Connecticut, Florida, and Oregon discussed the ways in which collaborations had occurred in treatment drug courts, an increasingly popular alternative to traditional adjudication in drug cases. Such courts present real challenges to the traditional adversarial role played by defense counsel but create opportunities for defenders to play a role in devising long-term positive direction to their clients' lives. On the whole, defenders find that the benefits to their clients, such as dismissal of charges and life-changing treatment, outweigh the risks of a change in the lawyers' role. Margaret Borg, chief public defender in Missoula, Montana, has been working with drug courts for about 2 years. A local judge was the first proponent of the treatment drug court. Participants in the Missoula program, other than the defendant, are the judge, the prosecutor, the public defender, and a youth court representative, either a case manager or a probation officer dedicated to the court. As design of the program progressed, Ms. Borg became aware that the treatment option would require compromises of traditional adversarial roles, not only her own but those of the prosecutor and judge as well. She was willing to change her role so that treatment options would made available to her clients. ""I have always thought,"" she said, ""that treatment was a very important component and a very underplayed resource in our youth system."" She felt that, in the long run, she did not have to make many serious concessions because the prosecutor  was willing to implement preadjudication procedures for admission to the treatment program. ""All of our kids that are in the drug court,"" she said, ""enter denials and go through the program."" James Egar is the Yolo County public defender in Woodland, California, by his own account a small, relatively poor county of about 150,000 people (see appendix 18). When he arrived, the county had no juvenile drug treatment facilities. After obtaining a modest grant from the county of $40,000 for drug-testing and related services, interested participants were able to put together a volunteer network. Mr. Egar built partnerships by working closely with the sheriff, participating in ethnic diversity training for the sheriff 's deputies, training local law enforcement officers how to testify, speaking to local civic and school groups, and building alliances with national groups such as the National Drug Court Institute. The National Drug Court Institute provided national data showing that participants in drug court programs experienced an 80-percent success rate, with success defined as completion of treatment and no further contact with the courts. Mr. Egar rejects the concern that drug courts require defenders to sell out clients. Work in the drug courts requires a different approach to advocacy, but successful completion of the program can be as important as a successful defense and acquittal in court because the attorney actually helps to change the defendant's life. The ""social worker aspect"" of defense in drug court, he suggested, ""should not be spoken of with embarrassment but with pride, boasting that you're doing the finest work in criminal defense."" In New Haven, Connecticut, a drug court was started 3 years ago as a result of State legislation introducing drug courts in five locations across the State. Assistant Public Defender James Chase described the operation of the drug court in New Haven. The drug court accepts cases involving felony and misdemeanor defendants, excluding violent criminals and drug sellers. Participants enter treatment programs lasting from 12 to 15 27   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  months, depending on how well they respond. The drug court also helps with housing and other social programs and permits home visits by police. Because of Mr. Chase's concern about letting police officers into his clients' homes, the New Haven program gives advance notice of police visits. Mr. Chase expressed respect and trust for the judge and prosecutor who work with him and his clients in the drug court. Even the police have become willing participants. After 3 years of participation in the program, Mr. Chase concludes that the drug court is a success. ""My view as a public defender has to be a long-term view,"" he said. ""I need my drug court clients to succeed."" Theda James is Misdemeanor/Juvenile Bureau chief in the Office of the Public Defender in Tampa, Florida. She works with a voluntary, prediversion juvenile drug court. A contract for participation is signed by the parent, the child, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney. For all of the participants, training in the model is crucial because adversarial style is sacrificed to a cooperative effort to ensure the client's success. Treatment is the focal point. She concludes that ""if a child completes this program, then we've all won."" Paul Newton is a staff attorney with the Metropolitan Public Defender's Office in Portland, Oregon. He is supervisor of Portland's adult drug court and the community court. After some resistance to abandonment of adversarial representation of his clients, he found that he could figure out ways to present his position without litigating. Now his narrow goal is dismissal of the charges because, if clients succeed in either community court or drug court, their cases are dismissed. From a broader perspective, however, he is trying to get and keep clients out of the system. ""I'm trying to keep them out of a system that dehumanizes, humiliates, and treats them badly,"" he said.  E. Detention and Sentencing Advocacy for Juveniles: Baltimore and Miami Defender programs representing juveniles often embrace a more holistic philosophy based on the premise that children are fundamentally different from adults in all ways: socially, emotionally, cognitively, and developmentally. It is not enough, said Patricia Puritz, director of the Juvenile Justice Center of the ABA, to merely represent children. ""You really have to get to know who your client is,"" she said. Defenders must ask themselves, ""who is this child before you?"" In juvenile detention facilities in Maryland, children are generally locked in their rooms and receive poor educational services inside the facility. About 80 percent are represented by the public defender. The Detention Response Unit of the Office of the Public Defender in Baltimore, Maryland, was created to deal with children who are detained not because they are accused of serious crimes but because they are bothersome. These juveniles, said Mary Ann Scali, an attorney and social worker with the unit, ""who have gotten into a fight with their sister and the parents called the cops; their mom got a new boyfriend and decided that she didn't want the child at home any more; a girl who decided that she needed to steal diapers for her baby; or girls who don't want to be home because they can't get along with either of their parents."" The unit was designed to deal with two related issues: the overrepresentation of minorities in juvenile facilities and the provision of effective assistance of counsel to detained juveniles. Funding for the program came from a joint grant proposal by the public defender office and the Juvenile Justice Advisory Council, under which the public defender hired an attorney and a social worker to work specifically on these two issues. Later, the grant was doubled to two social  28   Collaborations: Indigent Defense as a Full Par tner in the Criminal Justice System  workers and two attorneys working in all of the juvenile facilities statewide. One of the benefits of collaboration with the Juvenile Justice Advisory Council is that its name gives public defenders and social workers immediate access to clients in any facility. By having the kind of early intervention the Detention Response Unit can provide, Ms. Scali said the attorneys are able to gain the trust of the child and provide a much-needed service. ""Having the child removed from the facility and actually wrapping those community-based services around them and putting them back in a better environment makes a huge difference,"" she concluded. ""We see many fewer of our clients coming back"" (see appendix 17). Florida law permits the prosecutors unfettered discretion in the transfer of children as young as 14 from juvenile to adult court, and a grand jury can indict at younger ages. As a result, Steve Harper, a Dade County public defender, said that in the Miami Public Defender's Juvenile Section, a separate unit in the public defender's office, they now have about 1,300 cases transferred from the juvenile to the adult system. The office represents children ranging in age from 11 to 17. Although the adult court assumes jurisdiction, in a number of cases the child can be sentenced as a juvenile, and transfers back to the juvenile court can occur on a negotiated plea. Working from the premise that the mandate of the office is not just to provide representation but to try to have meaningful effects on the lives of clients, the program obtained more than $100,000 in grants from BJA to fund two social workers and a full-time lawyer who, in addition to two attorneys contributed by the office, worked with outside consultants hired to put together a juvenile sentencing project. The program has assessment, advocacy, and programming components. The initial objective  of the program is to get a clinically based assessment of children transferred to the adult system. ""We wanted to provide a very comprehensive and thorough assessment of who they are, what they need, what their strengths are,"" said Mr. Harper. The office then proposes a sentencing outcome for the child that includes a recommendation for a particular program. Of the 1,300 juveniles who were waived in during the past year, only 23 received juvenile sanctions in the adult system, a result that supports the need for the sentencing advocacy program. Marty Beyer, a clinical psychologist from Great Falls, Virginia, who has worked with children and families in the juvenile justice system for more than 20 years, discussed issues of adolescent development, offering not just new strategies but new moral insights into defender representation in that context (see appendix 14). Dr. Beyer urged a developmental perspective in juvenile representation. These theories can be applied at waiver hearings, at the hearing or trial, or later at the dispositional stage. Overall, the developmental perspective holds that children do not think in the linear style of adults. First, she said, ""adolescents don't anticipate. They don't plan well. They have a lot of accidents because of their cognitive, not their intellectual, limitations."" Second, children take a lot more risks than adults. Third, adolescent thinking can be inflexible. Adolescents only have the capacity, she asserted, for a ""plan A, not a plan B."" In addition, adolescents have not completed their moral development. Loyalty and fairness are the moral rules that kids operate by, and loyalty is the stronger of the two. She finds that one of the most difficult things to assess is a child's remorse. ""It's too easy,"" she concluded, ""to take at face value a kid's lack of shame and not recognize that their ability to talk about their victim has to do with their feelings of guilt and their immaturity in handling those guilt feelings rather than a lack of remorse.""  29   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  F The Tennessee Weighted Caseload . Study The Tennessee General Assembly created a statewide system of public defense in 1989. Before that time, the two largest cities, Memphis and Nashville, had locally funded public defender programs whereas the rest of the State used assigned counsel. After a successful pilot project creating four new public defender offices in the State promoted by the Tennessee Bar Association in 1986, the legislature was convinced that a public defender system would provide more systematic defense services and hold down costs. As originally adopted, the legislation created staffing levels defined by statute as one-half the number of attorneys in the district attorney's offices. But from the start, public defender caseloads were a major problem. In 1991, caseloads rose 26 percent, mostly because the office had been given appellate as well as trial responsibility for cases. In 1992, it had risen to crisis levels: 653 cases per attorney, including all types of cases from felony to misdemeanor and appeals. As described by State Public Defender Andrew Hardin, the program had two significant methods by which to control caseloads: conflicting out and work stoppage. The first alternative was of limited utility, so the second alternative finally was invoked by the Knox County public defender in 1992, when he decided that his office could not take any more cases and render effective assistance of counsel. The trial judges shut down the general sessions courts from public defender representation and started appointing everyone in Knox County who had a law license, including U.S. Senator Howard Baker and U.S. Department of Education Secretary Lamar Alexander. After prominent members of the bar complained of receiving appointments, the legislature started to listen. In part because of the staggering caseload figures, the legislature gave the office 41 30  additional full-time attorneys statewide. After consistent increases in both 1994 and 1995, the office was able to get help from a Byrne grant to employ private counsel to handle some appeals. With a sharp increase in the number of capital cases in 1996, caseloads again rose to more than 670 cases per attorney. That situation repeated itself in the 199798 fiscal year. Judges and prosecutors were pressing the legislature for additional funding. Homicides and capital prosecutions were creating serious stresses on small county systems not accustomed to long and expensive trials. The legislature, tired of dealing with the three unconnected, apparently subjective sets of requests, started asking for an objective, fact-driven formula that could be relied upon over time to link and project workloads and budgets for all three agencies. The result was the agencies' proposal for a joint weighted caseload study. To develop a funding formula for equitable and proportionate funding among the agencies in the future, all three agencies' workloads were examined, incorporating shared assumptions about the number and type of cases, the workload weight attached to different types of cases, the workload capacity of staff, and the inherent interdependence of all agencies' workloads. The Tennessee legislature made clear that until such a study was complete, there would be no funding for any additional judicial resources. An amendment was added in the general appropriations act authorizing payment for a judicial weighted caseload study to be prepared under the auspices of the State comptroller's office and completed by April 1, 1999, in time for consideration during the fiscal year 2000 appropriations process. G. Juvenile Defenders and Dependency Cases: District of Columbia and Maryland Defender programs have increasingly taken on civil matters that grow out of their criminal   Collaborations: Indigent Defense as a Full Par tner in the Criminal Justice System  caseload. This happens because there is often a loss of liberty at stake, because there is no other agency available, and because the clientele are, like criminally charged clients, indigent and entitled to the services of counsel. Examples of such civil matters are representation of children and parents in dependency, abuse, and neglect matters. Although national standards suggest that defender offices should be limited in their representation to proceedings ""arising from or connected to the initiation of criminal action against the accused"" (ABA Standards on Providing Defense Services, Standard 55.2), the line between civil and criminal matters is increasingly blurred when personal or familial losses of liberty are at stake. Attorneys in abuse and neglect matters in the District of Columbia are controlled by the Council for Child Abuse and Neglect (CCAN) program of the D.C. Superior Court. Director Lori Parker and her 3-person staff administer CCAN as a branch of the Family Division. About 400 attorneys take cases as assigned counsel, representing parents and children in abuse and neglect cases. For the past 3 years, an average of 1,500 petitions for abuse and neglect have come into the D.C. Superior Court. Children are automatically entitled to counsel, but parents must prove financial eligibility. She estimated that 95 to 99 percent of the parents qualify for counsel, even though income and asset levels to qualify for appointment are very low. The program never has a problem with recruiting new attorneys, who are required to participate in a 2-day training program and 16 hours of continuing legal education a year. They also hold bimonthly brown bag lunch training sessions on areas most desired by the panel attorneys. Lawyers for children are guardians ad litem, and counsel must agree to represent either party in proceedings. Every year, the program brings on about 50 to 60 new attorneys. Lawyers in the program are affiliated in the Family Trial Lawyers Association. Whereas recruiting and training  new lawyers is fairly easy, maintaining attorneys on the list and holding them accountable is more difficult. The D.C. Bar has no formal continuing legal education requirements, so attorneys in the program resist more rigorous standards. The Maryland public defender initially took cases of parents in abuse and neglect proceedings if they met financial eligibility guidelines. Some 90 to 95 percent were indigent. However, the number of clients rose and the State never supplemented the office's budget for this representation, so the program asked to be relieved of representation of abuse and neglect matters because they were not part of the office's statutory mandate. The office agreed to take on the cases when the government supplemented the budget, and in 1991 the office set up the Children in Need of Assistance (CINA) Unit to handle these matters. As in the District of Columbia, the program works with assigned counsel panel attorneys. Recruitment for the program is not difficult because the young lawyers take the job ""and within 2 months you're in court and the case is yours,"" according to CINA Chief Attorney Vanita Taylor. However, because fees for these cases are $30 an hour for out-of-court work and $35 an hour for in-court work, with fee caps in the cases, retention in the program is a big problem. Lawyers, once trained, often quit the program, so the CINA Unit began using staff attorneys. An example of collaboration within a large public defender office began when the Maryland CINA Unit joined with the juvenile, appellate, misdemeanor, and felony units to create the Family Justice Committee, which meets every 3 months. That committee watches for changes in the law and prepares positions for the office to take on proposed legislation. One example of its work was a proposal to hold parents criminally responsible for their children's wrongdoing when the children are adjudicated by the drug treatment court. The program simply refused to participate, an option which Ms. Taylor said it had because it 31   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  exclusively control the contract for provision of counsel to parents in CINA cases. Another example was legislation that permanently removed children from the custody of a parent who is convicted of certain offenses, permitting only supervised visitation. After consultation among the members of the Family Justice Committee, the office opposed the legislation. Collaboration permitted a unified approach by diverse units in a larger program. H. Mental Health Court in Broward County, Florida, and Neighborhood Defender Ser vices in Harlem Some defender programs are so unique and innovative that they stand alone in their structure and organization. Such is the case with the Mental Health Court in Broward County, Florida, and Neighborhood Defender Services (NDS) in Harlem. The largest provider of indigent mental health services in most areas is the local jail, due in part to the gradual shift in recent years away from institutionalization and toward criminalization of the mentally ill. Nationwide, it is estimated that about 10 percent of incarcerated people are mentally ill; approximately 200,000 on any given day. The percentages are 5 percent among women and 20 percent for juveniles. In Broward County, Florida, about 20 percent of all clients coming through the system are clients of the local provider of mental health services. The Broward County jail has almost twice the number of mentally ill inmates as the State hospital in Broward County, a facility that serves a fourcounty area. The development in the 1960s of drugs that allowed management of serious psychiatric illnesses resulted in a vast movement, supported by liberals and conservatives alike, toward deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, with a commensurate reduction in the number of beds in State institutions. However, systemic costs are  much greater for the mentally ill in jail. First, their average length of stay in jail can be as much as five times as long as that of nonmentally ill inmates. Additional costs include psychiatrists, special jail cells, and medications. In addition, the medications that mentally ill inmates receive in jail may not be as effective in treating their illnesses as medications they could get in medical facilities. Doug Brawley, chief assistant public defender in charge of courts, Broward County Public Defender Office, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was instrumental in creating the first Mental Health Court in the Nation. Because so much of the initial contact with the mentally ill is made by police or caseworkers, he said, ""if the police diverted all the minor misdemeanors with mental health problems and didn't put them in custody, or the caseworkers were more active, there would be very little need for a criminal justice system."" When he focused his representation on the mentally ill about 7 years ago, before creation of the Mental Health Court, he felt that his job as a defender was to get mentally ill defendants out of the system as quickly as possible by having them plead guilty to time served. But that created an endless cycling of people in the system. As a partial solution, he and others began to press for competency exams, arguing that the office would not plead guilty when the client was incompetent. However, many people actually stayed in custody longer with that argument. Mr. Brawley conducted a publicity campaign using 30 or 40 articles that highlighted mentally ill people in jail, showing how misguided that policy was. When the press coverage of the issue ceased, the public defender's office began its own newspaper, the Mental Health Court News, which was sent to judges and local hospitals and was posted on the office's Web site. As a result of the campaign, a local legislator helped the office get funding for residential treatment. The courts responded by creating the  32   Collaborations: Indigent Defense as a Full Par tner in the Criminal Justice System  Mental Health Court, in which the judge dispenses what she calls therapeutic jurisprudence. If a defendant wants a trial, the case is returned to the trial division, but the judge's knowledge of local service providers has made her quite effective in obtaining treatment alternatives, supported by ample resources to make mental health assessments. Because the court is focused on keeping mentally ill offenders out of jail, treatment providers are available and there is information about noncustodial alternatives. The court also uses psychology interns; local college students finishing a doctoral program in psychology have volunteered to develop a screening instrument that could get more people into the program. Unlike a traditional public defender office that reacts to criminal charges by waiting for appointments from the courts, Neighborhood Defender Services (NDS) of Harlem was created to try to rethink the provision of indigent defense services. Traditional public defender offices, said NDS Director Leonard Noisette, are structured more for the convenience of judges, prosecutors, and lawyers--everyone but the defendant. The structure of the traditional office is to respond to the needs of the court by providing representation to qualified people who appear before the court without representation. Client focus was one of the reasons that the Harlem office was community based. Harlem was chosen for a number of reasons. First, it had the most in-borough prosecutions, so office personnel were not stretched by having to travel to several courthouses. Second, it had a rich political history and a strong network of other service providers, which would be important for full-service delivery. The office represents only people who reside within a defined geographic area in Harlem. A second feature of the office is early entry into representation of its clients, with service provided on request, even at the police precinct and before formal charging. The office prefers to accept cases prior to the first court appearance, but it will accept cases up to the sixth day after  the first appearance. Early entry has its greatest impact on the office's ability to conduct early and effective factual investigation. For instance, the office very aggressively seeks and finds witnesses and tries to take written statements, and there have been a number of instances in which its teams have contacted witnesses before the district attorney's office. Although early entry into cases did not cut down on case-processing time or pretrial release rates in statistically significant ways, the positive effects of early entry are most notable in ultimate results. Research conducted by the office shows that as a result of early entry, its clients serve significantly fewer days of incarceration overall. The third major component of the program is team defense. Rather than assigning a single lawyer a caseload, the office makes a group of people collectively responsible for representation. The teams are composed of a supervising attorney, four staff attorneys, an investigator, a social worker, and an administrative assistant. One lawyer is assigned lead representation. The method has proved to be effective in helping the investigator and social worker on the team understand their roles and how their work relates to the overall representation. A fourth component is comprehensive representation of clients in civil matters that arise out of criminal proceedings, such as forfeiture proceedings related to drug charges; eviction proceedings as a result of a family member being arrested and charged with a crime; family court proceedings if a family member is accused of abuse and neglect and is also facing termination of parental rights proceedings; or police misconduct cases in which a client in a criminal case has alleged police abuse. In assessing the success of the Neighborhood Defender Services, Mr. Noisette recommended that defenders and others in the system expand their definition of the notion of value. ""We really have got to begin to define value differently than how much it costs to process how many cases."" Some very significant 33   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  components of the value of a system of defender services may be difficult to quantify. ""What is the value of working with someone after their case is over? What is the value of keeping a family together? What is the value of providing job  placement in terms of reducing the number of people coming back into the system?"" An accessible office in one's own community and the ability to choose one's own lawyer, Mr. Noisette observed, have benefited clients significantly.  34   Collaborations: Indigent Defense as a Full Par tner in the Criminal Justice System  V. Conclusion Collaborations, partnerships, affiliations, or coalitions--no matter what the name, the clear message of the National Symposium on Indigent Defense was the value of working in community. At least four themes ran through an agenda of coalition building and systemic thinking. First was the necessity of maintaining core values, civility, respect, and trust, not only within the program but in interaction with other components of the criminal justice system. Second, although the role of systemic actor is not new to many successful public defender systems, a shifting national terrain requires more effort in combining the political skills of the manager with the classic defense skills of the advocate. True leaders must also be good managers. Third, that same shifting national terrain includes a shared commitment by the justice system to the efficiencies of information sharing and economies of scale in technology use. The options created by reasonably priced new computers and other technologies, combined with new cooperation agreements across the justice system, put these assets within reach of virtually all organized defender programs. Fourth, and perhaps most important, there is a change in the vision of the role of the public defender in providing legal services to the office's clients. Instead of seeing an endless succession of individual cases moving through the assembly line of the courts, defenders are beginning to see and develop new programs that treat their clients more holistically, focusing on their grounding in families and the broader community. Diversion and treatment alternatives to prison are sprouting up in public defender programs mostly on behalf of children, who are the most vulnerable, impressionable, and fragile of our community assets. The fact that so many of the innovative programs target populations of color also speaks to deeper societal divides in need of attention. ""Long-term impact"" on clients' lives was mentioned as a goal of many collaborations by defender programs, in contrast to ""repeated representation."" Prevention, focusing on strengthening family and community, is seen as an important part of the defender's role. ""If you go into a collaborative effort as a defender to batter down the doors, you are going to fail. But if you go into the collaborative effort understanding what your values are and where you're not going to give, but also understanding that the other parties at the table also have their own core values, then you can find areas of common work where you'll succeed."" --Jim Hennings, Executive Director, Metropolitan Public Defender Service, Portland, Oregon  Attorney General Reno and her Justice Department staff, in demonstration of their own commitment to collaboration, continue to hold regular meetings with the representative of the defense bar to discuss ongoing concerns. Plans are already under way for a Second National Symposium on Indigent Defense that will build on the 1999 symposium's profiled programs and successes. At the close of the symposium, BJA Director Nancy Gist urged defenders to write a  35   National Symposium on Indigent Defense  letter to her if they were interested in learning more about BJA's programs or resources. ""We will serve as a broker and hook you up with what it is that you are looking for--the information or the technical assistance,"" she said. She  also noted that OJP is in the process of putting together a special Web site with information resources available within OJP for defender organizations.  36   Appendixes  37   Appendix 1 Agenda: National Symposium on Indigent Defense   AGENDA Office of Justice Programs and Bureau of Justice Assistance National Symposium on Indigent Defense: Improving Criminal Justice Systems Through Expanded Strategies and Innovative Collaborations February 2526, 1999 Washington, D.C.   Thursday, February 25, 1999 7:30 a.m. 8:30 a.m.8:45 a.m. (East Room)  Registration Welcome  Overall Moderator: Norman Lefstein Dean and Professor of Law Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis, IN The Honorable Laurie Robinson Assistant Attorney General Office of Justice Programs Washington, D.C.

Using Virginia’s new Anti-Spam law, a Loudoun County grand jury has   indicted a Spam Kingpin regarded as the eighth-worst spam distributor in the world. The   new law, authored by Kilgore earlier this year, is considered the toughest in the nation   and was used as the model for the criminal portion of the federal legislation. Kilgore   made the announcement at the headquarters of America Online in Dulles, Virginia, with   representatives of AOL, MCI and UUNet.     ""Anyone who has e-mail certainly knows about Spam –   that frustrating, unwanted e-mail that shows up every day by the dozens or hundreds in   your in-box,"" Kilgore said. ""Spam has a direct, negative impact on the   efficiency and effectiveness of the free enterprise system and day-to-day operations of   business.""     Law enforcement authorities executed a search warrant and   arrested Jeremy Jaynes (aka: ""Jeremy James"" and ""Gaven Stubberfield"")   in Raleigh, North Carolina, Thursday morning and charged him with four felony counts of   using fraudulent means to transmit unsolicited bulk e-mail in violation of Virginia’s   Anti-Spam law, which allows for prosecution in Virginia if any part of the illegal   transactions take place in any locality in the Commonwealth. Extradition procedures are   underway to return Jaynes for prosecution in Loudoun County, Virginia, where the grand   jury indicted him on Monday. ""Gaven Stubberfield"" is listed as the eighth-most   prolific spammer by the Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO) available on the spam   information website  www.spamhaus.com . He faces four   felony charges, each carrying punishment of one- to five-years in prison, a fine of up to   $2,500, or both.     ""The indictment alleges that the defendant falsified or   forged electronic mail transmission information or other routing information in connection   with the transmission of the spam,"" Kilgore said. ""This falsification prevents   the receiver from knowing who sent the SPAM or contacting them through the ‘from   address’ of the e-mail. This is what makes this e-mail a crime in Virginia and the   volume that was sent during this period elevates the charge to a felony.""     The indictment alleges that spam was sent between July 11,   2003 and August 9, 2003 through servers located in Virginia. Specifically, spam sent on   July 16, 19 and 26 exceeded 10,000 messages during each 24-hour period. Additionally, spam   messages in excess of 100,000 were sent during the 30-day period between July 11 and   August 11. These numbers do not reflect the total number of messages sent, as they are   based solely on actual complaints received by Internet Service Providers from their   customers. The indictment also alleges that the sender falsified transmission or routing   information to prevent recipients from knowing who sent the messages and how to contact   the sender.     The investigation was initiated by the Attorney   General’s Computer Crime Unit in August with the assistance of the investigative arms   of various Internet Service Providers. The investigation followed three routes: the domain   names in the e-mails, the ISPs in the e-mails and the internet connections. Kilgore   declined to provide further details of the investigation, citing the coming felony   prosecutions.     Kilgore’s anti-spam law, sponsored in the 2003 General   Assembly by Del. Jeannemarie Devolites (Vienna) and Sen. Ken Stolle (Virginia Beach),   prohibits the sending of unsolicited bulk e-mails by fraudulent means, such as changing   the header or routing information to prevent recipients from contacting or knowing the   identity of the sender. Such activity is punishable as a class 1 misdemeanor, or as a   class 6 felony if any one of the following conditions applies:                   The volume of spam transmitted exceeds 10,000 in any 24-hour         time period, 100,000 in any 30-day time period, or one million in any one-year time         period.         Revenue generated from specific spam exceeds $1,000 or total         revenue from all spam transmitted to any ISP exceeds $50,000.         The defendant knowingly hires, employs, uses or permits any         minor to assist in the transition of spam.               A class 6 felony is punishable by a one- to five-year prison   sentence and a fine of up to $2,500 or both. The legislation also includes asset   forfeiture provisions to allow law enforcement authorities to seize any assets or proceeds   obtained through the illegal spam operation. It also enhances penalties for violation of   Virginia obscenity laws through the sending of illegal e-mails. The legislation authorizes   the Attorney General’s Computer Crime Unit to investigate and prosecute spammers if   illegal e-mails are sent to, from, or through any computer or computer network located in   any Virginia locality.      -30-      Back to Press Release main page"
GX237-60-0873961	Department of Law                 June 20, 2000   ATTORNEY GENERAL SALAZAR ANNOUNCES PLEAS & SENTENCES IN FAKE    ID/CHECK CASES   Denver-- Attorney General Ken Salazar announced today the convictions and sentencing    of Verna Lynne Cruz, the ringleader of a counterfeit ID and check fraud operation    along the Front Range and participant in a similar enterprise, and Timothy Wade    Bentley, a co-participant in both enterprises.    With the conviction and sentencing of Cruz and Bentley, 25 of 27 defendants    in criminal cases alleging the two criminal fraud enterprises have now pled    guilty and have been sentenced or are awaiting sentencing. The Colorado Attorney    General's office obtained statewide jury indictments resulting in the cases    against Cruz, Bentley and the 25 others in June and September 1999. The remaining    two defendants are awaiting trials scheduled later this year for their alleged    participation in the enterprises.     Cruz was sentenced last week to 15 years in state prison by the Arapahoe County    District Court after pleading guilty to racketeering. Cruz was also sentenced    in June to 12 years by the Jefferson County District Court after pleading guilty    to felony charges involving theft and conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs.    The separate sentences will be served concurrently.    Bentley was sentenced to 15 years in state prison by the Arapahoe County Court    after pleading guilty to racketeering. Bentley was also sentenced to eight years    in state prison by the Jefferson County District Court after pleading guilty    to felony charges involving theft and possession of illegal drugs. The separate    sentences will be served concurrently.   The 25 convictions relate to their various roles involving the creation and    production of counterfeit Colorado driver licenses and counterfeit checks and/or    conduct related thereto. The phony checks were distributed to several of the    25 defendants who used them, along with the phony driver licenses for identification,    to fraudulently obtain cash, goods or services.        The phony driver licenses and checks were produced using computers and commercial    computer software. The phony checks comprised a mixture of personal, business    and payroll accounts. It is believed bank account numbers were taken by from    stolen mail and bank and business logos scanned, simulated or copied. The driver    licenses combined the names of real people with photos of the enterprise members.    The funds illegally obtained through the scam were used in part to fund the    use of the illegal drug methamphetamine.   Numerous unsuspecting businesses located in Arapahoe, Jefferson, Denver, Adams,    Douglas, Boulder, and El Paso Counties were victimized by this activity, including    the banks honoring the checks. Hundreds of phony checks were written, totaling    approximately $340,000.   Last year's indictments against the 27 defendants were the result of multi-jurisdiction    counterfeit ID and check forgery investigations involving, in part, the offices    of the Colorado Attorney General; Arapahoe, Adams, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson,    and El Paso County District Attorneys; Denver, Aurora, Greenwood Village, and    Colorado Springs Police Departments; El Paso, Douglas, Jefferson and Arapahoe    County Sheriffs; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.    As a result of these cases, Attorney General Salazar successfully pushed for    the passage of a new identity theft law sponsored by Rep. Carl Miller and Sen.    Tom Blickensderfer. The new law strengthens existing forgery and theft laws    by criminalizing the making, distribution or possession of false identification    document-making implements such as drivers license templates.                      [  Home  |  Department Home  |  Top  ]    Comments to  attorney.general@state.co.us

Unfortunately, due to state budget cuts, the Department of Personnel is not able to provide every employee with an Employee Benefits Handbook. However, the handbook is available on the web site of the Iowa Department of Personnel at: www.state.ia.us/idop/BenefitsHome.html. (Click here if you have internet access) The Employee Benefits Handbook will also be available on the Benefits Bulletin Board in Lotus Notes for those who do not have internet access.  January 2, 2002 will also bring significant changes in the Deferred Compensation Program courtesy of federal statutory changes. The maximum amount you can defer increases to 100% of your income up to a maximum of $11,000. The statutes now provide that this amount will increase annually over the next several years. A new provision allows individuals who are over age 50 to defer up to $12,000 a year. The ""three-year catch-up"" provisions for persons nearing retirement have also been changed and will allow up to $22,000 to be deferred during 2002. Other statutory changes make rollovers to other tax deferred accounts much easier than they have been in the past.

According to Jane Wilson, Grundy Clerk of Court, her staff took time out September 15th for a time of silence to remember the victims and heroes of the attack. ""Some of us attended church services over our lunch break,"" said Wilson. ""Many of us are dressed in red, white and blue, and some of us have pins showing hands held together across America."" ""Here in Chickasaw we each have a small flag at our desk, a paper flag on our door, and a patriotic arrangement on the public counter,"" said Clerk of Court Damian Baltes. Many employees are reaching into their pockets to help victims of the attack. ""Employees in our office have been collecting money for the Red Cross, said Sharon Modracek, Linn County Clerk of Court. ""One employee and her sister made red, white and blue ribbon lapel pins, which they are selling to raise money for the Red Cross. Many employees have purchased them."" Modracek added that another employee decorated the office with flags, and red, white and blue decorations. In Dubuque County, the court administrator 's office distributed lapel flag pins to judges, lawyers, staff, and others. They also have flags on their desks, in the windows, on the doors, and on the wall. Ruth Esser-Recker said, ""I'm sure that we'll keep the spirit of patriotism alive in other ways in the future.""  F  Beth Baldwin, District Court Administrator for the Fifth District reported, ""Courthouse staff are wearing red, white and blue (or blue) ribbons, and the flag is at half mast. Many people attended the ceremony at Nollen Plaza."" Baldwin added that one employee sent around an e-mail with detailed information about donating blood at the blood bank. ""We observed a moment of silence on Friday noon. U.S. flags are now the decoration of choice throughout the office,"" noted Clay Gavin, Clerk of Court in Dubuque County. Lodema Berkley, Clerk of Court in Johnson County, and her staff hung flags, and red, white and blue decorations in their office. Cheryl Thrailkill, Associate Editor of the Bench Press, made blue ribbon lapel pins for her and other court employees, and displayed patriotic decorations in her workspace. The clerk of court office in Allamakee County is decorated with a red, white, and blue bunting normally reserved for the 4th of July. In addition, each workstation has a small U.S. flag on display and patriotic `window clings' adorn the office door and the door of the judge's chambers. Carl Christianson, Clerk of Court for Allamakee County, who fought in the Vietnam War, and later, served in the Philippines during the Gulf War, said, ""I'm shaking out the wrinkles in my uniform in hopes they will call me for help somewhere."" He added, ""I guess we no longer live in America, it has to live in us.""   Iowa Bench Press  September-October 2001 Page 4  Flag Etiquette  T   he Flag Code, which formalizes and unifies the traditional ways in which we give respect to the flag, also contains specific instructions on how the flag is not to be used: The flag should not be used as a drapery, or for covering a speaker 's desk, draping a platform, or for any decoration in general. Bunting of blue, white and red stripes is available for these purposes. The blue stripe of the bunting should be on the top. The flag should never be used for any advertising purpose. It should not be embroidered, printed or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use.  to the north or east. If the flag is suspended over a sidewalk, the flag's union should be farthest from the building. Raising and Lowering the Flag The flag should be raised briskly and lowered slowly and ceremoniously. Ordinarily it should be displayed only between sunrise and sunset. It should be illuminated if displayed at night. The flag of the United States is saluted as it is hoisted and lowered. Displaying the Flag Indoors When on display, the flag is accorded the place of honor, always positioned to its own right. Place it to the right of the speaker or staging area or sanctuary. Other flags should be to the left. The Flag in Mourning To place the flag at half staff, hoist it to the peak for an instant and lower it to a position half way between the top and bottom of the staff. The flag is to be raised again to the peak for a moment before it is lowered.  The flag is to be flown at half staff in mourning for designated, principal government leaders and upon presidential or gubernatorial order.

The Governor also said that he would call a special legislative session within thirty days. This is the latest in a series of moves designed to head off a snowballing deficit. Most agencies and departments began the fiscal year in July with reduced budgets. In September, Governor Vilsack directed certain state agencies to reduce their spending by an additional 7% to save $108 million.  The revenue outlook for FY 2003 is just as bleak. The Governor has called for $200 million in budget reductions for the next fiscal year in anticipation of a continued downturn in state revenues. He has directed agencies to look for ways to ""consolidate programs, streamline administration, or eliminate operations to achieve...substantial General Fund savings beginning July 1, 2002.""  Meanwhile, the Iowa Judicial Branch continues to operate on what court officials refer to as a ""bare bones/status quo"" budget. Many of the budget cuts implemented last year are still in place. Among those exempted from the 7% cuts More stringent measures will be necessary, were the department however, if the of public safety, the Legislature dedepartment of public appropriates ""At this point, I won't dismiss defense, indigent the possibility of a de-appropria- money from the defense, the school courts. tion, and more cuts for fiscal for the blind, state aid year 2003.

The state's slow economy has been blamed for the lowest revenue growth in twenty years. ""I don't remember ever having a decrease in court generated revenue,"" said Peggy Sullivan, Director of Finance and Personnel for the Iowa Judicial Branch. ""The slow economy and fewer court filings are probably the two main reasons for the drop in revenue."" In calendar year 2000, indictable criminal filings decreased 11%; dispositions were  down 4%. Simple misdemeanor filings dropped 5%. A breakdown of court receipts shows that collections of fines, forfeited bail, and infractions decreased 8% in FY 2001, while the criminal penalty surcharge was 4% lower. Filings of scheduled violations, which accounts for a significant portion of fines collections, were 2% higher in calendar year 2000. Court officials are keeping an eye on court revenue because it directly affects the money available for court technology  projects. The Enhanced Court Collections Fund is tied to receipts from court fines and fees. The Judicial Branch keeps up to $4 million of collections of fines and fees that exceed an annual target set by the revenue estimating conference. ""I'm hopeful that we still meet our target,"" said Sullivan. Court revenue directed to cities and counties did not fare as poorly, coming in at 1% above the previous year.   Iowa Bench Press  September-October 2001 Page 7  Recent Iowa Criminal Decisions By Ann E. Brenden  July 2001 State v. Allen, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 00-0041) (Iowa 9/6/2001). Drug delivery: ""procuring agent defense"" unavailable. One who merely assists the buyer in obtaining drugs is not entitled to the ""procuring agent defense"", overruling State v. Lott, 255 N.W.2d 105 (Iowa 1977). That defense was based on the theory that one could not aid and abet a delivery when assisting only the recipient. Court now recognizes that the statute is intended to criminalize participation in drug deals, regardless of one's role as a buyer or seller. ""Given this evident legislative intent, we agree with the State's claim that the procuring agent defense simply has no place in such a statutory scheme. We therefore reject the purely semantic analysis applied in Lott, and now overrule its holding that one who aids only the transferee of drugs cannot be found guilty of delivery."" State v. Belken, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 99-2001) (Iowa 9/6/2001). [1] Rebuttal evidence--no abuse in allowing testimony not given in prior deposition. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting rebuttal evidence that an investigating officer failed to disclose during a deposition (that the defendant's wife--who denied the statement during her own crossexamination at trial--had told another witness she was not sure whether her husband had committed the offense). ""Belken's request to preclude testimony came from the investigating officer's failure to disclose information in a deposition, which Belken wrongly attempted to use as a discovery device to pin sanctions on the State. We also conclude Belken was not prejudiced by the evidence."" [2] Evidence--DNA. Scientific director of a private forensic paternity and DNA testing laboratory in St. Louis, Missouri was qualified to testify as an expert on DNA  testing and results; State was not required to show expert's laboratory was certified in order to independently establish she was competent to apply and use the DNA technology; and witness was not obligated to explain the specific mathematical computations utilized during the DNA process. [3] Merger. The district court erred in entering judgment and sentence for both first-degree kidnapping and second-degree sexual abuse. ""We merge the sexual abuse conviction, and vacate the judgment and sentence entered on that conviction."" State v. Bergmann, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 00-778) (Iowa 9/6/2001). [1] Search and seizure--patdown of person and search of immediate area. Police are allowed to pat down a suspect if they have reasonable suspicion that a crime is being or is about to be committed, or if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and the officer 's safety is in jeopardy. The following factors justified a patdown of the suspect as well as the area under the seat in the vehicle he had been driving: ""Bergmann was spotted in a known drug area alongside a nefarious drug dealer. When the drug dealer saw police, he immediately retreated from Bergmann's car, and Bergmann drove away quickly. [The officer] recognized Bergmann from a past weapon and drug arrest. [The officer] felt concern for his safety. Bergmann lied to [the officer] about where he had been recently. Bergmann acted nervous while outside the car. Given all of these factors, [the officer] had reasonable suspicion to pat down Bergmann for weapons. Moreover, once [the officer] concluded that further investigation was reasonably necessary, he was warranted to assure his protection by ensuring that those in his presence  Ann Brenden, Assistant Attorney General, is the Editor of the Iowa Criminal Law Handbook (2d ed. 1994). Ann's synopses of the cases are also contained on the Iowa County Attorney Association's web site.

[2] Detention and performance of canine sniff. A dog sniff of a car 's perimeter is not a search. However, ""police cannot unduly prolong their detention of an individual to secure a drug dog or for any other reason without additional suspicion of wrongdoing that warrants expansion of the stop."" The few minutes required for the canine unit to reach the scene fell within the requirements that ""the dog sniff be conducted within a reasonable amount of time from the initial, lawful stop and that the stop is not unduly prolonged without a sufficient basis."" [3] Probable cause based on results of dog sniff. ""When the dog was alerted by smelling the presence of narcotics, this provided police with probable cause to search the vehicle."" State v. Campbell, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 00-1109) (Iowa 9/6/2001). Alcohol consumption by underaged person in the home. An adult under the age of 21 cannot act as his or her own guardian so as to fall within the exception allowing consumption of alcohol in private residences when a guardian consents to the underage person's consumption of alcohol and is present. State v. Crawley, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 99-1643) (Iowa 9/6/2001). [1] Handwriting exemplar--disguised sample admissible for same purposes as refusal to give sample. Defendant's provision of disguised handwriting in response to court order was admissible against him at trial as evidence of his consciousness of guilt, just as his total refusal to provide a handwriting exemplar would have been. [2] Admission of improper evidence cured. When the State elicited testimony regarding contempt proceedings, the trial court cured any error by admonishing the jury to disregard the reference to contempt. The same was true of the State's introduction of evidence of a rash of burglaries in the city, by informing the jury that such evidence ""was admitted only to serve as background information."" [3] Evidence of defendant's drug usage. Evidence of a defendant's drug usage is admissible when it is not wholly independent of the offense for which defendant is being charged; here, serving as the defendant's motive for the thefts. State v. Hoegh, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 00-1633) (Iowa 9/6/2001). Appointment of special prosecutors by court as opposed to Board of Supervisors. Notwithstanding a recent amendment to section 331.754(1) transferring the statutory power of appointment of a prosecutor from the courts to the board of supervisors, the district courts still possess inherent authority to do so ""when necessary for the administration of justice."" In the absence of such a showing, as here, the court errs in appointing a special prosecutor. State v. Johnson, ___ N.W.2d ____ (Sup. Ct. No. 99-940) (Iowa 9/6/2001). Defendant waives motion to suppress by failing to timely file it. Unless good cause for the lateness is shown, an untimely motion to suppress under the rules of criminal procedure waives the claims asserted. (Unpublished opinion, but see new amendment to Iowa R. App. P. 14(e) allowing citation to unpublished appellate opinions). State v. Legg, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 00-225) (Iowa 9/6/2001). [1] Garage -- legitimate expectation of privacy. A garage is deemed part of the house's curtilage in which the owner has a legitimate expectation of privacy as evidenced by the following facts: the garage is in very close proximity to the home, is attached to the residence, is included within an enclosure--the walls-- surrounding the home, the door to which is closed, and is used as to store vehicles and other items incident to the use of the premises as a home. As such, a person has a legitimate expectation of privacy in an attached garage as part of the property's curtilage. [2] Warrantless search--exigent circumstances and probable cause. Warrantless entry of defendant's garage were reasonable so as to be within the bounds of the 4th Amendment ""probable cause and exigent circumstances"" exception where the officer saw defendant's vehicle run a stop sign, activated his lights, and chased defendant who then accelerated and ran another stop sign, weaving from curb to curb. Upon reaching her home, defendant exited her car and went inside the garage, ignoring the pursuing officer 's command to stop. The officer took three steps inside the garage in the process of stopping and speaking to defendant, then arrested her for OWI and interference with official acts. ""Although Legg had a legitimate expectation of privacy in her garage, there were exigent circumstances and probable cause that justified Killpack's minimal invasion of this privacy interest."" State v. Lopez, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 00-238) (Iowa 9/6/2001). [1] Counsel --substitute counsel. No abuse of discretion in denying request for substitute counsel where the court made adequate inquiry of the complaint, which yielded no information bearing on the question. [2] Vienna Convention warning--failure to give. Defendant determined not to be entitled to a new trial due to the State's failure to notify him of his right to contact the Mexican consulate. Assuming without deciding that Article 36 of the Vienna Convention creates an individually enforceable right of notification and that the arresting officers knew Lopez was a Mexican national yet failed to advise him of his right to contact the Mexican consulate, the court concludes that defendant failed to show  Continued on page 9   Iowa Bench Press  September-October 2001 Page 9  Continued from page 8 prejudice. ""He did not and is unable to show that contacting the consulate would have resulted in assistance in arranging for alternate legal counsel or in accepting a plea agreement. We need not determine whether the violation had an effect on the trial."" State v. Mitchell, ___ N.W.2d ____ (Sup. Ct. No. 99-660) (Iowa 9/6/2001). 404(b) evidence--sexual acts toward other children. The district court abused its discretion in admitting other children's testimony (bearing on severed charges) concerning defendant's prior bad acts. Such testimony went only to defendant's propensity to abuse young girls. ""Any other result would cause exclusion of prior-bad-acts evidence under Iowa Rule of Evidence 404(b) to become the exception rather than the rule."" Dissent by Neuman and Ternus, JJ. State v. Ramirez, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 00-393) (Iowa 9/6/2001). Guilty pleas --deportation still considered a collateral consequence. Deportation is a collateral consequence about which the court is not required to advise the defendant at guilty plea. However, it ""would . . . be proper and probably desirable for the court to advise a defendant of such matters."" Likewise, the possibility of deportation remains a collateral consequence for purposes of determining the effectiveness of defense counsel's representation, although ""foreign-national defendants should be apprised of all applicable federal laws, especially federal deportation consequences of state guilty pleas."" State v. Royer, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 00-903) (Iowa 9/6/2001). Drugs -- manufacture charge. In order to establish a violation of section 124.401(1)(b)(7), the State must show that the manufacturing process actually yielded five grams or more of methamphetamine or any compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any quantity or detectable amount of methamphetamine. The State may aggregate any manufactured substance falling under either or both of these alternatives, but it is not sufficient for the State to rely on the potential yield of methamphetamine that might have been obtained from the ingredients found in the defendant's home and car. (Distinguishing this case from that in State v. Casady, 597 N.W.2d 801, 807 (Iowa 1999, a conspiracy case)). Taylor v. State, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Sup. Ct. No. 99-1285) (Iowa 9/6/2001). [1] Recusal did not constitute abuse of discretion. While trial courts should provide factual basis on the record for recusing themselves, the appellate court has never found--and does not here--an abuse of discretion in recusal. [2] Remedy: recusal of judge to whom case is transferred during appeal for ruling on 179(b) motion. Postconviction petitioner is not entitled to a new trial when original judge recuses himself from consideration of 179(b) motion upon transfer back to district court during appeal. ""As a matter of public policy, when a Rule 179(b) motion is pending, but the presiding judge recuses himself, it is the new judge who has the authority under Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 367(a) to decide if a new trial is required.""   Iowa Bench Press  September-October 2001 Page 10  Iowa Court Reporters Install New Officrs, Present Award to Weingart By Sheila Lasley Hall and Karen Hill he Iowa Court Reporters Association recognized M. Jane Weingart as its Distinguished Service Award recipient for 2001. The Association presented the award to Weingart, and installed new officers, at its annual meeting, which was held on June 22-23, 2001, at the Collins Plaza Hotel in Cedar Rapids. Weingart began her career as an official court reporter in 1973 in the Eighth Judicial District. Since 1988, she has operated her freelance firm, MJW Court Reporting Services, Burlington, Iowa. Weingart has been active in the court reporting profession, serving on both state and national boards and committees. Currently, she is chair-elect of the Board of Trustees of the American College of Business (formerly A.I.B.). The Association also installed its new officers. Jane Fitzgerald, an official reporter from Boone, Iowa, was installed as the president. Fitzgerald has been an active member of ICRA, serving in many capacities. She is also active in her church and community. During her one-year term as president, Fitzgerald will focus on court reporters being information technologists. Recognizing the ever-changing profession of court reporting, Fitzgerald's goal will be working diligently to increase student enrollment. Joining President Fitzgerald on the Executive Board are Jody Malloy, Boone, President-Elect; Brenda Ellefson, Marshalltown, Vice-President; Marty Thompson, West Des Moines, Treasurer; Linda Dona, Oelwein, Secretary; and Teresa Kordick, Past President. The freelance directors are Kelli Mulcahy, Des Moines, and Sue Ann Jones, Ankeny. The official directors are Sheila Lasley Hall, Bettendorf, and Karen Hill, Des Moines.  T  Karen Teig and Kellee Cortez, along with many volunteers, spent many hours making this an outstanding continuing education seminar. The program included a drug-detection dog, a motivational speaker, a demonstration of voicerecognition software, and other informative presentations. Cindy Burke spoke to reporters on her experience as a sexual abuse therapist in the state. Her presentation discussed the myths, misconceptions, trauma and treatment of a victim or sexual abuser. ICRA was fortunate to have two National Court Reporter Association representatives in attendance. Duane Smith entertained and enlightened reporters on the shortage of court reporters and captioners. Mary Jones was present throughout the seminar and had the official duty of installing officers. Bruce Fagerstrom, WahlTek, Inc., demonstrated voice recognition software. His presentation only strengthened the court reporter 's position in the courtroom or deposition. Many questions were generated, many left unanswered. Officers from the Cedar Rapids Police Department, Phil Hansen and Dan Jabens, as well as K9 dog, Djarko, demonstrated the dog's training and detection of street drugs. Carol Bos, J.D. Grand Rapids, Michigan, kept everyone inspired with her motivational, comedic routine. Carol knows the court reporting profession and related it to what reporters do day in and day out.

The results of the exam reveal 147 of 173 test takers passed the exam, an 85% pass rate. While a majority of those taking the exam were from Drake or Iowa, 32 schools from various states were represented. Drake University of Iowa had the highest number of test takers, with 73, passing 64. Fortytwo out of forty-nine University of Iowa students passed the exam, and thirteen of sixteen Creighton students passed. Seven of eleven who were taking the bar for the second time passed and four of four who were taking the test for the third time were successful. ""By and large I thought the bar exam was more straightforward than what I anticipated. I was surprised to find the essays to be the hardest section of the test. Prior to the exam, I thought answering the multistate questions was going to be the most difficult,"" said a recent Drake law school graduate.

I truly believe passing the bar examination was directly related to the quantity and quality of time spent studying these outlines.""  Another test-taker was very surprised by the length of the Multistate Bar exam questions. Because they had prepared with significantly longer practice questions, the time pressure during the actual exam wasn't as great as expected. Congratulations to all who were successful.   Iowa Bench Press  September-October 2001 Page 13  Spotlight A Room with a View  Chief Justice Lavorato, Justice Neuman and Justice Streit pose in the supreme court courtroom of the new judicial branch building, which is currently under construction.

Former Chief Justice Arthur McGiverin presented the award to Hunter at the Juvenile Court conference in Des Moines last month. Hunter has served as a CASA for eleven years and worked on six cases. Currently assigned to two cases, one involving two children and another involving four children. But Hunter 's volunteer efforts don't end there. She has pitched in many times to help with CASA office work including answering the telephone, filing, copying, mailing and case processing.

On November 1, 2001, at 3 p.m. in the Supreme Court Courtroom, the present and former judges and staff of the Iowa Court of Appeals will gather together to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the court. All the former judges, law clerks and administrative staff at the court have been located and invited to join in this celebration. The celebration will feature appellate celebrities and speakers who will reminisce and share the history of the Court with those in attendance. The celebration will also feature a commemorative booklet recounting the history and operations of the Iowa Court of Appeals. All court personnel and judicial branch employees, as well as the Iowa Bar and community at large are invited to attend this event.  P  The debate over the need for an intermediate, appellate court began almost a hundred years before the court was actually created by the Iowa Legislature. When the Court of Appeals was created in 1976, a challenge to the legal validity of the judicial nominations to the new court set off a major legal battle that ultimately had to be decided by the Iowa Supreme Court. This story and many others will be recounted by the former and current judges on the Iowa Court of Appeals. Judge Robert G. Allbee, one of the original judges appointed to the Iowa Court of Appeals, plans to share his memories and experiences as a member of court. The Court of Appeals has developed its own personality over the past twenty-five years, changing how cases are routed and how our state law is made. Over the years, the composition of the court has changed  in both number and representation. The celebration is an opportunity for the legal community to talk with the court and discuss the impact it has had on the law of the State of Iowa. The future of the Court of Appeals is also of interest on its 25th birthday, what with the addition of a new judge and the upcoming move to the new judicial building. It is hoped that the birthday celebration will provide a meaningful forum for sharing memories and constructing a vision of the court's future!  The original Court of Appeals was composed of (from left) Leo Oxberger, Allen (Barney) Donielson, Robert G. Allbee (chief judge), Bruce M. Snell, Jr., and James H. Carter.   Iowa Bench Press  September-October 2001 Page 16  Eisenhauer Appointed to Court of Appeals  D  istrict Court Judge Larry Eisenhauer joined the Iowa Court of Appeals on October 8.

GX026-41-13782818	August 8, 2003    ICE AGENTS ARREST THREE IN CONNECTION  WITH FRAUDULENT DOCUMENT RING IN ADAMS MORGAN  -- Arrests are the latest in Operation Card Shark --        WASHINGTON, D.C.  Special agents from the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have arrested three individuals in connection with a large-scale fraudulent document ring in the Adams Morgan section of Washington D.C.     At approximately 11:45 AM yesterday, ICE agents arrested  Gerardo Marquez-Cortez, age 27, Daniel Vazquez-Jimenez, age 34  and  Arturo Carmona-Zamorano, age 32  without incident at an apartment at 3514 13th Street, N.W. All three are scheduled to make their initial court appearance at 1:30 PM today before U.S. Magistrate Alan Kay in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.     ICE agents also executed a search warrant at the same location, where they seized 592 counterfeit identity documents that were being manufactured in the apartment including counterfeit alien registration receipt cards, also known as green cards, counterfeit Social Security cards, counterfeit employment authorization documents, counterfeit Mexican ID cards and counterfeit drivers licenses from two states.  Several document-making implements were also seized.      Gerardo Marquez-Cortez faces charges of re-entry after deportation and possessing, distributing and manufacturing fraudulent identification documents, such as social security cards and green cards.  Daniel Vazquez-Jimenez also faces charges of re-entry after deportation and possessing, distributing and manufacturing fraudulent identification. Arturo Carmona-Zamorano is accused of distributing fraudulent documents.      Gerardo Marquez Cortez is the brother of Salomon Gonzalez-Gonzalez aka El Virus, who last month was sentenced to 52 months in prison for his role as a kingpin in a counterfeit green card ring in Adams Morgan. Gonzalez-Gonzalez was arrested on November 25, 2002.      Marquez Cortez is believed to have inherited control over the counterfeit document operation after his brothers arrest. With todays arrests, ICE agents believe they have effectively removed the leadership of this criminal organization.    Todays arrests were the latest enforcement actions in an ongoing ICE initiative called Operation Card Shark, said Kevin Delli-Colli, the Special Agent in Charge for the Washington D.C. office of ICE. Through this initiative, we are aggressively targeting criminal groups responsible for the production of fraudulent documents in D.C.    To date, Operation Card Shark has resulted in the arrest of 50 document vendors, the criminal prosecution of 16 individuals, and the discovery and dismantling of four fraudulent document manufacturing sites.     ###          ICE, the primary investigative arm of the Department of Homeland               Security, was established to bring a unified focus to the enforcement               of U.S. immigration and customs laws, with the principal goal of               preventing violations by terrorists and other criminals who threaten           the nation's security.                                                               Last Modified 10/03/2003                          Report Suspicious  Activity 1-866-DHS-2ICE                     ABOUT           |  NEWS ROOM  |  ENFORCEMENT  |  CAREERS            Threat Level  |  Home  |  Text  |  Site Map  |  Search  |  FOIA  |  Legal  |  Firstgov  |  DHS
GX262-28-9469695	U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE 10 W. JACKSON BLVD. CHICAGO, IL 60604  NEWS RELEASE Thursday, June 13, 2002  Mexican Nationals Sentenced for Document Fraud Chicago, IL - Brian R. Perryman, District Director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in Chicago, together with Patrick J. Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, announced the sentencing yesterday of two Mexican nationals for the production and sale of counterfeit identification documents as part of a $500,000 a year counterfeit document ring. Ruben Gomez-Sanchez, age 44, and Daniel Hernandez-Cueto, age 19, both illegal aliens from Mexico, were sentenced June 12 by U.S. District Court Judge James B. Zagel. GomezSanchez received 21 months in prison and 3 years supervised release, and HernandezCueto received 30 months in prison and 3 years supervised release. Gomez-Sanchez and Hernandez-Cueto were two of eleven individuals arrested during the investigation by INS and Social Security of a counterfeit document ring operating on the northwest side of Chicago. In May 2001 a search warrant resulted in the seizure of two thousand seven hundred and eighteen counterfeit green cards and social security cards. Counterfeit documents sell on the street for between $80 to $120 per set, which includes a false social security card and green card, and are routinely manufactured and sold to illegal aliens who purchase such documents to obtain employment. Gomez-Sanchez and Hernandez-Cueto made and sold fraudulent green cards and social security cards to illegal aliens. The Chicago INS office initiated an investigation on these subjects and their co-conspirators in December of 2000 which resulted in the arrest of eleven individuals. Two were removed from the United States and nine pled guilty to conspiracy to manufacture and sell counterfeit green cards and social security cards. Since 1998, INS agents in Chicago have confiscated approximately 70,000 fraudulent documents from illegal manufacturers and vendors. Gomez-Sanchez and HernandezCueto will be surrendered to the INS upon completion of their sentences to be placed in INS custody for deportation proceedings. ###
GX236-18-10541367	"APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES  NUMBER OF VICTIMS  Case No. 343914: Single Victim The defendant used her husband's name and father-in-law's social security number to obtain five credit cards. The outstanding balances on the five cards exceeded $20,000 at the time her offense was discovered. She was sentenced to two years probation. Criminal History Category I  Case No. 377394: 389 Victims The defendant in this case bought and sold stolen ESN/MIN pairs for cloned cellular telephones, affecting approximately 389 cellular customers and victimizing 10 cellul ar service providers . Cellular telephone fraud does not cause monetary loss to individual victims whose numbers are stolen because the losses are absorbed by the cellular industry carriers. The losses to the companies totaled $13,000 but the amount of loss for sentencing was reduced by the court (reason unknown). Under the 2F1.1 guideline, the defendant received the enhancement for more than minimal planning and was sentenced to 3 years probation. Criminal History Category I  Page 1 of 9   APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES  Case No. 395675: 250 Victims This defendant was part of a large fraud conspiracy, involving at least 10 other co-participants and lasting more than a year. The defendants obtained financial and identification documents by dumpster diving, stealing mail, and burglarizing homes and cars. They searched for blank and completed checks, credit and debit cards, and driver's licenses. Using the stolen credit cards, the defendants rented hotel rooms to use as clearing houses. The stolen items were used to create false identification means (""breeder documents"" that were in turn used to open fraudulent bank accounts, pass stolen checks and make ATM withdrawals and credit card purchases. Losses for this conspiracy totaled more than $300,000. The defendant in this case was not directly involved of the theft of the original documents, but possessed counterfeit identification at the time of her arrest. In addition, she had accessed 27 of the compromised accounts using checks and credit cards for losses of $37,000. The defendant was sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment. The probation officer estimated that approximately 2,300 fraudulent credit card, check, and false identification incidents occurred as a result of this conspiracy. No individual victims were contacted by the PO to evaluate victim impact because there were so many. Criminal History Category I  Page 2 of 9   APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES  Case No. 400134: 1,130 Victims The defendant was part of a scheme involving the theft of ATM account numbers and accompanying PINs (Personal Identification Numbers) that were then used to manufacture counterfeit cards enabling the withdrawal of money from automatic teller machines. The co-conspirato rs used two different methods to obtain these numbers. First, they wrote computer programs that stored the account numbers from ATM cards when swiped at a sales terminal. Video cameras were placed above the adjoining keypads to record customers' PINs as they were entered. The information collected was later programmed onto the magnetic strips of blank (or ""white"") cards. The leaders of the scheme paid shop owners and clerks to install and maintain the equipment. The defendant was a clerk in a participating gas station. The second method involved the recruitment of bank tellers who persuaded customers to provide this information (purportedly for a legitimate bank transaction) which was similarly encoded onto blank cards. The total conspiracy acquired over 1,130 pairs of ATM account numbers and PINs that were used to withdraw money; losses exceeded $600,000. The defendant was responsible for 600 account numbers and PINs and losses of $159,000. He was sentenced to 3 years probation. Criminal History Category I  Page 3 of 9   APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES  NUMBER OF ID MEANS/USE OF BREEDER DOCUMENTS  Case No. 356421: 50 Fraudulent ID Means The defendant in this case was part of a large, on going (nearly 2 years) scheme to defraud businesses through the misuse of instant and in-store credit contracts. The defendant and co-participants created false identities by counterfeiting birth certificates and employment and/or educational verification. With these documents they fraudulently obtained driver's licenses. Other individuals were recruited to use the fraudulent sets of documents to obtain cellular telephone accounts and purchase electronics, jewelry, furniture, and clothing. None of the identification documents represented real individuals, but the scheme resulted in over $300,000 worth of loss to financial institutions and retail establishments. The defendant's wire fraud conviction was predicated on the fact that the in-store credit applications require faxes and phone calls to approve the credit applications. The guideline computation under 2F1.1 included the adjustment for ""more than minimal planning/scheme to defraud more than one victim."" Additionally, the defendant received an enhancement for leadership of more than five participants. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison. Criminal History Category II  Page 4 of 9   APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES  Case No. 359367: 40 Fraudulent Breeder Documents The defendant in this case submitted 40 false social security applications to the Social Security Administration and received cards. Each application represented a fictitious child that he claimed to have. The defendant sold each social security number to a co-participant for $150. The co-participant used the social security numbers to obtain birth certificates and fraudulent drivers' licenses. In turn, these documents were used to obtain loans and credit cards. Losses of $16,000 amassed for the unpaid loans and credit card bills. The defendant was sentenced to five years probation. Criminal History Category I  Case No. 344419: 100 Breeder Documents and Credit Cards While serving in the military, this defendant obtained a roster containing the social security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, and other personal information of other individuals stationed at his base. Upon leaving the service, the defendant used this information to manufacture military IDs and other documents to apply for credit cards. He had the cards mailed to out-of-state addresses and made purchases with the cards. He enlisted the help of three other individuals to make purchases with the fraudulently obtained cards. The purchases resulted in losses in excess of $10,000. At the time of his arrest, the defendant was in possession of 100 credit card numbers. The defendant received the ""more than minimal planning"" enhancement under 2F1.1 and an enhancement as the organizer/leader of the scheme. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison. Criminal History Category I  Page 5 of 9   APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES Case No. 396241: 5,191 Credit Card Accounts The co-defendants in this case obtained account numbers and personal information for 27 Merrill Lynch accounts in order to call and change the PINs for the accounts. They encoded the account information onto the magnetic strips on blank (or ""white"") cards and accessed the accounts through ATMs. They also changed the addresses and diverted the mail for some of the accounts. At the time of arrest, the defendant had in his possession a total of 5,191 credit card numbers on hotel receipts, rental car receipts, written on paper and in notebooks, and on computer printouts. He had been diverting mail to numerous addresses using various aliases. One victimized couple mentioned in the PSR had their mail, containing a c anceled check, diverted by the defendant. He used this check to order replacement checks with a different address. The defendant was also in possession of their social security numbers, broker's name, and a rental car receipt with their names and credit card number. The losses attributable to the defendant exceeded $1 million. The defendant was sentenced to 41 months' imprisonment. Criminal History Category II  Page 6 of 9   APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES UNDERMINING INTEGRITY OF THE POSTAL SYSTEM  Case No. 366055: Repeated Diversion of Mail The offender in this case was a disgruntled former employee of the victim. Using U.S. Postal Service forms, he diverted his former employer's mail 13 times over the course of 14 months. The mail diversions were temporary; he often allowed the mail to be re-routed correctly before re-diverting it in order to avoid detection. In the mail that he diverted to his own residence, the defendant received checks and credit cards belonging to the victim. Through charges to the credit cards and both attempted and successful deposits of the checks, the defendant incurred losses of $84,140. Due to the medical condition of the elderly victim, his monetary (or other) losses were unable to be determined. The defendant received a 10 month split sentence (5 months imprisonment).  Page 7 of 9   APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES  IMMIGRATION FRAUD  Case No. 388705: Mail Fraud The defendant in this case claims to have found the birth certificate and identification card belonging to another individual in his van and used the information on these documents to apply for a U.S. passport. He mailed the application, on which he falsely claimed U.S. citizenship, to the passport office. He was sentenced to four months in prison, receiving credit for time served which essentially equated to his sentence. Criminal History Category IV  Case No. 352028: 4 ID Means in Same Name The defendant submitted a counterfeit birth certificate, social security card, driver's license, and learner's permit all bearing the same name to a passport official. The official quickly discovered that the defendant was not the individual represente d in the documents and was, in fact, an illegal alien. The defendant had purchased the set of documents six years prior to the offense. He was sentenced to a two month prison sentence. Criminal History Category II  Page 8 of 9   APPENDIX F: ILLUSTRATIVE CASE SUMMARIES DURATION OF OFFENSE CONDUCT  Case No. 359894: 218 months The defendant's conduct dates back to 1979 when he was originally arrested in the state of Florida for drug possession. From the time of that original arrest, he began acquiring numerous fraudulent documents under as many as 10 apparently fictitious aliases. He initially secured driver's licenses and then acquired social security numbers, passports (both U.S. and other countries), voter identification cards, credit cards, bank accounts, leases, and utility services using his many aliases. The defendant was re-arrested a number of times and jumped bond or failed to appear in court for a number of different proceedings under his different aliases. The defendant was convicted by a jury one day after trial) for false statements, passport fraud, and social fraudulent documents used over the 18-year period. months later driving a rental car, wearing a disguise, he left court (during his security fraud related to the He was re-arrested two and carrying $20,000 cash.  The PSR suggests that the defendant was associated with gambling and drugs (having been convicted once of trafficking in Florida) and at one time owned a profitable power boat business (he was a successful competitive racer) that was seized, but he was not charged with offenses related to this conduct. The defendant was sentenced under the fraud guideline at 2F1.1. He received enhancements for more-than-minimal planning and violation of a judicial order, and was given the minimum floor of a base offense of 12. Because his offense involved foreign bank accounts there were no institutional or individual victims. (All of the aliases were fictitious, not actual individuals, and the defendant apparently paid all of his bills, so there was no ""loss to any financial institutions""). The PSR pointed out that the defendant had approximately a million dollars in bank accounts and had enjoyed a lavish lifestyle while using so many aliases. These factors, in combination with the defendant's constant history of bail jumping and failure to appear in court resulted in an upward departure of 6 to a level 18. In combination with the defendant's criminal history (earned under numerous aliases), Category VI, the defendant was sentenced to 71 months.  Page 9 of 9"

SEITZ                 Hearing On                 Phony IDs and               Credentials Via The Internet                -  An Emerging Problem                 May 19, 2000                                                 My name is Thomas W. Seitz. I am originally a               resident of the State of New Jersey and I am presently               incarcerated at the Baker County Jail located in Macclenny,               Florida. I am 23 years old and I am currently serving a prison               sentence imposed by the State of New Jersey after I was convicted               and sentenced to 3 years for committing the crimes of theft by               deception, forgery and uttering a forged instrument. I have also               pled guilty to bank fraud and I am awaiting sentencing by the               United States District Court, Middle District of Florida.                 I appreciate the opportunity to testify before               this Subcommittee. I hope that I can show its members how               relatively easy it is for someone to engage in obtaining               information from the Internet, including such personal information               as Social Security numbers. Moreover, I hope to show how easy it               is to craft phony identification using that information and obtain               significant amounts of money with little effort.                 I consider myself to be fairly well versed in               the use of computers. I have worked with computers since the 6 th                grade and was employed as a network engineer. I obtained via the               Internet, names, social security numbers, and addresses of people               by accessing files maintained as public record on the Securities               and Exchange Commission Web site. Although at first I did not have               the intent to defraud anyone, I started searching the Internet               again and determined there were a large number of sites that               offered the means to make fake identification and the opportunity               presented itself.                 I used a computer at the library in Old Bridge,               New Jersey and accessed various Web sites that offered documents               for downloading including birth certificates and driver's               licenses. Some were free so I found one that offered a New Jersey               birth certificate and downloaded it. I utilized computer software               to add the information I wanted and after I obtained a blank W-2               from the IRS Web site, I took the completed documents with the               fake identity information to the New Jersey department of Motor               Vehicles and obtained in short order a genuine State of New Jersey               photo identification card.                 I feel that if I wanted to take the time and               effort, I could have used the same documents and obtained a               genuine driver's license as well. During the time I was searching               the Internet for fake identification Web sites, I frequently came               across disclaimers on the individual sites that would say               ""for novelty use only."" I can't think of any reason why               a statement like that would be there. It did not deter my actions               in any way. I did make a fake driver's license by altering mine               using various computer programs including Adobe Photoshop.                 After I had the documents, I went on the               Internet and obtained a car loan using the identity of people I               found on the Web. When these car loans were approved and I               received checks, I went to the car dealer to attempt to purchase               new vehicles with false identification. For the most part, it was               very easy. The new car dealers want to sell cars and pay very               little attention to the details of identification. I got cold feet               and left the first time I tried to buy a car with fake               identification. The second time, the car dealer just accepted my               photocopied fake driver's license, took the insurance binder I had               previously secured and a short time later, I was driving one of               the most expensive vehicles off the lot. I eventually was               discovered after the car dealer submitted the paperwork for               licensing and the DMV determined the numbers that I used for the               driver's license were not valid. I realize what I did was illegal,               but I would also say that it was not very difficult to accomplish.                 In conclusion, I found that there was a readily               available supply of fake identification providers on the Internet.               Anyone with some computer skills can download the available               templates for fake identification from the fake identification Web               sites and produce some high quality fake documents. I feel that if               Web sites, especially United States Government Web sites were               prohibited from providing specific personal identifiers on the               Web, such as Social Security numbers, it would make activities               such as mine a bit more difficult.                 #                                                                                                              Committee         Members  |  Subcommittees  |  Hearings          |  Key Legislation  |  Jurisdiction            Press Statements  |  Current         Issues  |  1997 Special Investigation  |  Video         of Select Hearings  |  Sites of Interest"

Felix and Mercedes Navarrete, their daughter Joann Frederick,                      30, and associate Pedro Miramontes, 51, were being held on                      a total of 28 felony counts involving theft, said Detective                      Gene Arreola of the Los Angeles Police Department's Financial                      Crimes Division.                     They were being held at Van Nuys jail in lieu of $1 million                      bail each.                     Felix Navarrete, 70, and his wife Mercedes, 54, were initially                      arrested in April in the case, but no charges were filed then                       because of incomplete evidence, Arreola said.                     Arreola declined to detail the charges against the Navarretes,                      their daughter and the fourth suspect prior to the arraignment,                      which he said would occur within 72 hours.                     But he said the case built on allegations that were made                      public when the Navarretes were first arrested. At that time,                      police called Luz de Oro - in Spanish, Light of Gold - a ""complex,                      endless chain scheme"" that promised new cars and homes                      to people but rarely delivered. Police said the club had some                      25,000 members, thousands of whom invested at least $2,000.                      Some were bilked of more than $20,000, according to police.                     People became eligible for the club's ""automobile program""                      after investing about $3,800 and signing up at least seven                      new members, police said in April. Some victims drove sport                      utility vehicles off car lots under the mistaken impression                      Luz de Oro would pay for them; police said the cars were usually                      bought under deferred payment plans and no payments were made.                     Many of the cars have now been repossessed.                                                                                                                                                    • Securities   • Franchises  •  Off-Exchange Commodities  • Investment and Financial Services •  • Independent Escrows  • Consumer and Commercial Finance Lending  • Residential Mortgage Lending •         Back to Top of Page                © 2003 State of California.

FISCAL ANALYSIS    ASSUMPTION      Officials of the  Office of the State Courts Administrator (CTS)  assume this proposal would make changes in various computer-related laws and create several new related crimes.  The legislation would also change the law relating to child pornography and create a new series of offenses.  There may be some increase in the number of cases filed.  CTS would not expect any significant impact on the budget of the judiciary.      Officials from the  Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DES)  assume the proposal revises laws relating to computer crimes.  It would require public schools, state colleges, universities, vocational schools, technical schools, and libraries with computers accessing the Internet to ensure the computers contain software designed to prevent minors from gaining access to material which is pornographic for minors, or to purchase Internet connectivity from an ISP that provides filtering services.      DES estimates that there are 140,286 computers around Missouri school districts with Internet connectivity.  42% of districts report using filtering software on 85% of their computers.  The distribution of these computers across districts is not known.  Filtering software ranges in cost from $0 to $25.  Additionally, software prices and capabilities vary according to the target age level.  Given this information, DES believes the cost would be significant, i.e. in excess of $100,000; however, DES cannot construct a specific estimate.      In response to a similar proposal, officials from the  Office of the State Public Defender  assumed that existing staff could provide representation for those 15 - 25 cases arising where the indigent persons were charged with increased penalties for computer crimes.  However, passage of more than one similar bill would require the State Public Defender System to request increased appropriations to cover the cumulative cost of representing the indigent accused in the additional cases.       Officials from the  Office of Prosecution Services  and the  Department of Public Safety  assume there would be no fiscal impact to their agencies as a result of this proposal.      Officials from the  Office of the Attorney General   (AGO)  assume the AGO has already seen a significant increase in consumer fraud cases over the Internet.  This proposal provides Missouri with jurisdiction over cases where a Missouri citizen is a victim of a consumer scam or other crime.  The AGO anticipates a need for a high tech crimes unit to investigate and prosecute cases where the Internet is used in criminal activity.  AGO anticipates this unit would include the following: one (1) Assistant Attorney General IV, two (2) Assistant Attorney General II's, and two (2) Investigator's.  In addition there would be additional equipment and computer needs in       ASSUMPTION  (continued)      out years as changes in technology occur.      In response to a similar proposal, officials from the  Office of the Cole County Prosecuting Attorney  assumed generally that the enactment of a criminal statute which criminalizes conduct heretofore otherwise legal has only a small impact on county prosecutors' overall workload.  Nevertheless, the creation of new criminal statutes requires that existing prosecutor case management and case reporting systems be upgraded.  The total cost of these upgrades is approximately $250,000 per year.  Some percentage of that cost is due to the enactment of new criminal statutes.  The conduct outlined in the proposal is, for the most part, already prohibited by other criminal statutes.  Thus the proposal would not result in increased workloads.  Even though the conduct is already criminal, the fact that new statutes are being created would have the fiscal impact described above.         Due to the lack of an increased workload,  Oversight  assumes the costs to upgrade the case management/reporting systems, allocable to this proposal, would be minimal; therefore, no fiscal impact will be included in this fiscal note for the Office of the Cole County Prosecuting Attorney.      In response to a similar proposal, officials from the  Office of the Boone County Prosecuting Attorney  assumed the proposed legislation will have an unknown fiscal impact on their agency.      Oversight  assumes the costs, allocable to this proposal would be minimal; therefore, no fiscal impact will be included in this fiscal note for the Office of the Boone County Prosecuting Attorney.      Officials from the  Department of Corrections (DOC)  stated that they could not predict the number of new commitments which could result from the creation of the offense(s) outlined in this proposal.  An increase in commitments would depend on the utilization by prosecutors and the actual sentences imposed by the court.  If additional persons were sentenced to the custody of the DOC due to the provisions of this legislation, the DOC would incur a corresponding increase in operational costs either through incarceration (at least $35.00 per inmate, per day) or through supervision provided by the Board of Probation and Parole (at least $3.00 per offender, per day).  Due to the wide variance of newly created crimes and punishments, the fiscal impact as it relates to the DOC is unknown.      The DOC anticipates that new beds might have to be constructed to accommodate the number of offenders receiving longer sentences due to this proposal.  At this time, the DOC is unable to     determine the number of people that would be convicted under the provisions of this proposal to       ASSUMPTION  (continued)      estimate the fiscal impact for additional capital improvements.  Estimated construction cost for one new maximum security inmate bed is $48,800.      Oversight assumes the proposal could result in more offenders being incarcerated or placed on probation.  Additional costs for supervision and care by the DOC, although unknown, would     likely exceed $100,000 annually.      In response to a similar proposal,  officials from  Southeast Missouri State University   (SEMO)   assumed the proposal would affect approximately 200 computers in the library.  All other computers on campus are not for public use.  SEMO estimates costs of $100 annually per machine for software, annual upgrades, labor and maintenance to comply with the legislation.      Missouri has approximately twenty, state-supported colleges and universities.   Oversight  assumes these institutions have similar computer facilities and will also incur costs similar to those estimated by SEMO.  Even though these costs would be incurred, Oversight assumes the costs would be absorbed within each institution's budget and would not expect the institutions to request an increased appropriation as a result.      In response to similar legislation, officials from the  Missouri River Regional Library  assumed they would need one FTE Network Assistant ($46,000) and one FTE Library Assistant ($21,804).  They would need equipment costing approximately $30,000 annually.  They also estimate needing web site registrations, database licensing and filtering software costing approximately $125,000 annually.        In response to similar legislation, officials from the  Daniel Boone Regional Library  assumed the proposal would result in personnel costs of approximately $150,000 annually; capital improvements of approximately $72,000 in FY 2001; and computer software and supplies of $43,000 in FY 2001 and approximately $9,000 annually in subsequent fiscal years.      Officials from the  Secretary of State's Office (SOS)  state Section 181.020(4), RSMo, directs the Missouri State Library to ""furnish information and counsel as to the best means of establishing and maintaining libraries, selection of materials, cataloging, and other details of library management.""  To that end, the State Library employs staff within the Library Development Division to carry out this function.  Library Development staff provide assistance through one on one consultation and training sessions.  It is estimated that questions from public library directors, trustees, and those maintaining the software on library computers would require the services of the equivalent of .5 FTE.  Personnel costs for .5 FTE ($18,240) Library Consultant are based on budget rate for the position.  Salary increases are projected at 4%.        ASSUMPTION  (continued)      Expense and Equipment calculations are $3,352 per each new .5 FTE.  The  Oversight Division  used salaries increases of 2.5% in the fiscal impact.      SOS officials state it would not be possible to project a total cost of public libraries to install filtering software.  Costs for filtering software vary widely by vendor and type, number of computer stations, and whether the software is installed on each ""client"" computer workstation or on a central server.  The web pages of a sampling of filtering software vendors indicate approximate annual costs in the following ranges: $150 for a site with 5 computers; $500 to $800 for 25 computers; and up to $2,500 or more for a site with 125 computers.  Several large library systems with many branches would have 100 or more computer stations requiring filtering software.  Libraries choosing to install the filtering software on a server could also need to purchase suitable equipment for the installation.  SOS officials also assume public libraries could have additional staff costs due to the legislation.  Staff time required for installation and maintenance of filtering software could be significant.  If all terminals have filtering software,     requests from adults for access to unfiltered sites might require assistance from library staff.  Requests to have sites unblocked would be processed individually, and could require individual adjustments of the software.  Library staff would also have to monitor the use of the computer workstation, to ensure the filtering software is active when the workstation is used by minors.  Library technical services staff would also need to spend considerable amounts of time, at least initially, checking to see that the filtering software did not block access to sites the library did not wish to block.        The proposal would require the SOS to establish rules and regulations for enforcement.  The estimated cost of a page in the Missouri Register is $22.50.  The estimated cost of a page in the Code of State Regulations is $26.50.  The actual costs could be more or less than the number given.

DESCRIPTION      This proposal makes changes to provisions concerning computer crimes.  The proposal:          (1)  Amends the current statute providing civil remedies for victims of computer crime by adding       DESCRIPTION (continued)      owners or lessees of computers or computer equipment to those who may utilize the statute.  Currently, only owners or lessees of computer systems, networks, programs, or services may use     the statute.  The proposal also amends the current statute to allow for the recovery of expenses incurred to block future access by the perpetrators of computer invasion of privacy or unlawful     computer communications (537.525);            (2)  Establishes the jurisdiction and venue for crimes committed through use of a computer as any county in which any act was performed in furtherance of the crime, or any county in which       the accused had control of materials or objects used in furtherance of the crime, or any county in which computers or computer equipment used in furtherance of the crime are located, or any county from which, in which, or through which access to a computer or computer network was made (541.033);                                            (3)  Amends current law to allow law enforcement to obtain warrants to search for and seize child pornography for other than evidentiary purposes without first holding an adversarial    hearing to determine whether the matter is obscene (542.281);      (4)  Extends the statute of limitations for computer crimes to one year after discovery of the offense, but not more than 3 years after the offense occurs (556.036);      (5)  Expands the harassment statute to include electronic and in-person communications, and increases the penalty for communicating a threat to commit a felony from a class A misdemeanor to a class D felony (565.090);      (6) Clarifies that the offense of aggravated stalking includes credible threats made by electronic communications, in person, or by posted messages publicly accessible via a computer (565.225);      (7)  Creates the class C felony crime of invasion of privacy in the first degree when nude photographs or images made without the subject's consent are distributed or made accessible by    computer.  The proposal amends the current invasion of privacy statute, which does not require the distribution or transmission of images, to make it a crime in the second degree (565.253);      (8)  Extends the duty to computer providers, installers or repair persons, and Internet service providers to report to law enforcement if they know of or see images depicting child pornography.  Currently, this duty is only imposed on film and print processors.  The proposal           DESCRIPTION (continued)      also raises the age of children that the statute applies to from 17 to 18 (568.110);      (9)  Expands the crime of causing catastrophe to include the sending of a computer virus and altering a computer program that controls a public service (569.070);      (10)  Amends the definitions section of the child pornography laws to include the creation and     sending of child pornography via computers (573.010).  The proposal also upgrades the crime of promoting child pornography to class A Felony (573.025, 573.035);      (11)  The proposal upgrades the crime of possession of child pornography to make it a class B Felony (573.037).  The proposal also upgrades the crime of furnishing child pornography to a minor to make it a class A Felony (573.045);      (12)  Amends the evidentiary statute to include newly created first and second degree possession of child pornography and furnishing child pornography to a minor (573.050);                                                                                    (13)  Repeals current computer crime statutes (569.093-569.099) and replaces them with additional crimes.  The proposal amends the definitions sections of current computer crime statutes by updating and expanding existing definitions, and adding 5 more terms (578.500);                       (14)  Amends the crime of tampering with computer data by deleting the act of accessing a computer and intentionally examining information about another person as a violation of the    statute.  The proposal also increases the penalty from a class D to a class C felony, and increases the value of property from $150 to $500 (578.503);                                                                                                                      (15)  Amends the crime of tampering with computer equipment by increasing the penalty from a class D to a class C felony, and increases the value of property from $150 to $500 (578.506);                                                                            (16)  Amends the crime of tampering with computer users by increasing the penalty from a class D to a class C felony, and increases the value of property from $150 to $500 (578.509);       (17)  Creates the crime of computer invasion of privacy when a person uses a computer or computer network, program, software, or system to intentionally examine without authority personal or financial information of another.  The penalty is a class D felony unless the crime is  committed to obtain property worth $500 or more, which is a class C felony (578.512);                                                                                      (18)  Creates the crime of unlawful computerized communications when a person, for purposes     of frightening, intimidating, threatening or disturbing another, communicates by computer: a        DESCRIPTION  (continued)      threat to commit any felony, which is a class D felony; a communication with coarse, offensive     language, which is a class A misdemeanor; an anonymous communication, which is a class A       misdemeanor; or communications repeatedly after receiving notice from the receiver to stop,     which is a class D felony (578.515);                                                        (19)  Gives prosecuting attorneys and the Attorney General concurrent jurisdiction to bring actions under the new computer crimes statutes, and for any case involving computers in this       state (578.518, 578.521); and                                                                                                      (20)  Requires that school districts, technical and vocational schools, and libraries that provide computers accessible to students or the public, on or before July 1, 2002, either use software designed to prevent minors from accessing pornographic material or purchase Internet services from a provider that filters services to limit minors' access to pornographic material.      This legislation is not federally mandated, would not duplicate any other program, and could  require additional capital improvements or rental space.

Special agents from the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have arrested three individuals in connection with a large-scale fraudulent document ring in the Adams Morgan section of Washington D.C.     At approximately 11:45 AM yesterday, ICE agents arrested  Gerardo Marquez-Cortez, age 27, Daniel Vazquez-Jimenez, age 34  and  Arturo Carmona-Zamorano, age 32  without incident at an apartment at 3514 13th Street, N.W. All three are scheduled to make their initial court appearance at 1:30 PM today before U.S. Magistrate Alan Kay in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.     ICE agents also executed a search warrant at the same location, where they seized 592 counterfeit identity documents that were being manufactured in the apartment including counterfeit alien registration receipt cards, also known as green cards, counterfeit Social Security cards, counterfeit employment authorization documents, counterfeit Mexican ID cards and counterfeit drivers licenses from two states.  Several document-making implements were also seized.      Gerardo Marquez-Cortez faces charges of re-entry after deportation and possessing, distributing and manufacturing fraudulent identification documents, such as social security cards and green cards.  Daniel Vazquez-Jimenez also faces charges of re-entry after deportation and possessing, distributing and manufacturing fraudulent identification. Arturo Carmona-Zamorano is accused of distributing fraudulent documents.      Gerardo Marquez Cortez is the brother of Salomon Gonzalez-Gonzalez aka El Virus, who last month was sentenced to 52 months in prison for his role as a kingpin in a counterfeit green card ring in Adams Morgan. Gonzalez-Gonzalez was arrested on November 25, 2002.      Marquez Cortez is believed to have inherited control over the counterfeit document operation after his brothers arrest. With todays arrests, ICE agents believe they have effectively removed the leadership of this criminal organization.    Todays arrests were the latest enforcement actions in an ongoing ICE initiative called Operation Card Shark, said Kevin Delli-Colli, the Special Agent in Charge for the Washington D.C. office of ICE. Through this initiative, we are aggressively targeting criminal groups responsible for the production of fraudulent documents in D.C.    To date, Operation Card Shark has resulted in the arrest of 50 document vendors, the criminal prosecution of 16 individuals, and the discovery and dismantling of four fraudulent document manufacturing sites.     ###          ICE, the primary investigative arm of the Department of Homeland               Security, was established to bring a unified focus to the enforcement               of U.S. immigration and customs laws, with the principal goal of               preventing violations by terrorists and other criminals who threaten           the nation's security.                                Last Modified 10/03/2003                        ABOUT           |  NEWS ROOM  |  ENFORCEMENT  |  CAREERS            Threat Level  |  Home  |  Text  |  Site Map  |  Search  |  FOIA  |  Legal  |  Firstgov |  DHS
GX252-04-2619056	"Testimony of  Paul Virtue  Acting Executive Associate Commissioner  Office of Programs   Immigration and Naturalization Service  Department of Justice   Regarding  Documents and Benefits Application Fraud   Before the House Judiciary Committee  Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims  Tuesday, May 20, 1997, 9:30 a.m.  2237 Rayburn House Office Building   INTRODUCTION Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee: On behalf of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), I am pleased to have this opportunity to testify on document fraud and benefit application fraud. Immigration fraud has increased dramatically in recent years and currently affects all aspects of INS responsibility. As the INS has bolstered and expanded its border control, worksite enforcement, and criminal alien programs, there has been a corresponding increase in the number of aliens resorting to fraudulent means to enter and remain in the United States. In general, immigration fraud falls into two broad categories: document fraud and benefit application fraud. (1) Document fraud encompasses the counterfeiting, sale, and/or use of identity documents or breeder documents such as birth certificates and Social Security cards, alien registration documents and stamps, passports and visas, and other fraudulent documents and paperwork to circumvent the immigration laws of the Nation. These fraudulent documents are often relied upon either to enter the United States or function within American society (e.g., worksites), or to support the acquisition of lawful immigration benefits. (2) Benefit application fraud involves the willful misrepresentation of a material fact to gain an immigration benefit in the absence of lawful entitlement. In point of fact, document fraud and benefit application fraud are often part of a continuum.   SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM Of the two categories, benefit application fraud poses the greater threat to the integrity of INS approval procedures for granting legal status. With benefit application fraud, an ineligible alien who successfully passes through the INS adjudicatory process receives a valid, Service-issued alien registration card and is unlikely to be detected thereafter. The alien, in effect, is ""home free."" In contrast, a smuggled or otherwise illegal alien who does not choose this path must constantly keep a ""low profile"" or use fraudulent documents to avoid detection. Then too, the continued reliance on fraudulent identity documents subjects the alien to greater risk of detection. As INS capability to uncover document fraud advances, ineligible aliens will resort increasingly to benefit application fraud to obtain the highly valued authentic immigration documents. Benefit application fraud encompasses naturalization, political as marriage and other family relationships, legalization, Temporary based immigrant and non-immigrant categories. Accompanying t summaries of fraud investigations that reflect the broad spectrum ylum, permanent residence based on Protected Status (TPS), and employmenthis testimony is an addendum containing of immigration fraud.  In addition to the wide range of INS programs affected, the sheer volume of fraudulent applications relating to a single benefit fraud scheme can be enormous, and the structure of the criminal conspiracy complex. Operation Desert Deception is a case in point. The investigation targeted several immigration consulting businesses that filed applications to qualify illegal aliens under the extended legalization and Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) programs. Of the 22,000 applications filed by the targeted arrangers, nearly 5,500 were admittedly fraudulent, and 4,400 were suspected of being fraudulent. As a result of the investigations, 54 individuals were successfully prosecuted. The Government estimates that these individuals received in excess of $4,000,000 in fees for filing the fraudulent ""late amnesty"" applications. Of special note is the fact that Operation Desert Deception was the first time INS used extensive computer support and rudimentary data mining techniques to identify fraud trends among potentially fraudulent cases. Large scale conspiracies can no longer be investigated solely with traditional investigative techniques. Like a single money laundering transaction, an individual fraudulent application can often easily pass scrutiny. Only through computer analysis was it determined that hundreds of individuals were simultaneously claiming to be living in the same one bedroom apartment; or that hundreds of others claimed to be living simultaneously at the same, nonexistent addresses. Moreover, alien criminals and terrorists manipulate the benefit application process to facilitate expansion of their illegal activities, such as crimes of violence, narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and entitlement fraud. For example, Mir Aimal Kansi, the Pakistani terrorist wanted in connection with the Central Intelligence Agency Headquarters shootings, had been issued two employment authorization documents: one after having applied for political asylum; and, one after having applied for legalization. The nexus between criminal activity and benefit fraud is also evident in the cases of suspected Russian organized crime figures who are the beneficiaries of L-1 (Intra-company transferee) petitions filed by non-existent or non-operating businesses. PAST INS ANTI-FRAUD EFFORTS The investigation of immigration fraud has long been an enforcement mandate of the Investigations Division of the INS. Under the Investigations Case Management System, inaugurated in 1983, emphasis was placed on identifying, developing, and prosecuting cases against fraud facilitators involved domestically or on foreign soil in the sale, distribution, manufacture, or alteration of fraudulent documents, and those who broker illicit services to aliens, such as sham marriages, fictitious job offers, and bogus investment schemes. The passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) and the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments Act greatly expanded the INS' obligations to detect and deter fraud during the legalization process, the employment eligibility verification process, and the acquisition of legal benefits   through spousal and fiance(e) relationships. To counter the escalating incidence of IRCA-related fraud, the INS in 1988 included the detection and deterrence of fraud among its top priorities. Exclusive of the traditional types of immigration fraud such as marriage and other relationship fraud and occupational preference fraud, Investigations' responsibilities with regard to IRCA fraud alone were extensive. Yet, because of additional responsibilities mandated under the new immigration laws and the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988, the dedication of resources to traditional fraud investigations was severely curtailed. Statistical Data A review of statistical data between 1985 and 1996 points out the impact of other Service priorities on the INS fraud program. In 1985, the productive workyears (FTEs) devoted to fraud investigations equated to 256 special agents. With implementation of the Employer Sanctions provisions of IRCA, the special agent equivalent dropped to 201 in 1987 and to 139 in 1988. Between 1989 and 1991 resources devoted to fraud investigations increased. However, in 1992 with the reassignment of 150 special agents to the Violent Gang Task Force (VGTF) initiative of a former Attorney General, the special agent equivalent dropped significantly again from 231 to 210. With the redirection of manpower to the incarcerated criminal alien removal program and insufficient base funding, these numbers dropped to 181 in 1995 and to 139 in 1996. In 1985, INS Investigations received 15,171 fraud cases and completed 11,316. In 1987, receipts dropped to 6,880 cases and completions fell to 6,536. In 1988, receipts stood at 6,266 with completions at 5,741 cases. The decline in receipts was attributable to the fact that a field office would not receive and open cases that the office did not have the resources to work and to the fact that other INS components were reluctant to refer suspected fraud cases to field Investigations offices that did not have sufficient resources to conduct the necessary investigations. In 1995, servicewide, Investigations received 13,524 cases and completed 6,455. Investigations completed this task with 181 investigators, fewer than the number available in 1985. Considering only active cases received, investigators completed 47 percent of their work, which left 53 percent not completed. In 1996, receipts amounted to 8,514 fraud cases, but inadequate resources resulted in the completion of only about 50 percent (4,366) of such cases. Other investigative activities such as Anti-smuggling, Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, and Violent Gang Task Force do a significant amount of fraud work. However, this fraud work is tracked as other than fraud and, therefore, is not included in INS fraud statistics. The Immigration Examinations Fee Account (EFA), which authorizes the Attorney General to use examinations fees collected by the INS to pay for processing applications and petitions under the INA, was established by the Department of Justice Appropriations Act of 1989. In March 1992, Congress approved the reprogramming of 100 permanent INS Investigations positions to be funded by the EFA. The 100 positions were dedicated to the conduct of fraud investigations in support of the Adjudications and Naturalization programs. These benefit fraud investigations target single issue fraud schemes, as well as major fraud facilitator conspiracies and large-scale fraud organizations, such as marriage fraud rings. In 1993, as part of a comprehensive political asylum reform initiative, the INS established a fraud task force aimed at curbing abuse of the Asylum program. The task force mounted a two-pronged crackdown on fraudulent asylum applications, designed to locate unscrupulous preparers of abusive asylum applications, pursue possible criminal prosecutions and impose fines under the Civil Document Fraud provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Asylum fraud cases targeted aliens and United States citizens engaged in individual or group schemes to obtain work permits for aliens by filing fraudulent asylum applications. Together with the legislative changes and the successful fraud conspiracy prosecutions of facilitators, a notable decrease in the number of filings of fraudulent asylum applications occurred. During FY 1996, the INS presented for prosecution an impressive number of cases involving federal criminal violations directly related to fraud investigations. These cases included individual violations of Title 18 USC  1001, making a false statement or writing (1429); Title 18 USC  1028, possessing identity documents to use falsely (4563); Title 18 USC  1543, using a forged or altered passport (267); Title 18   USC  1544, misusing a passport (441); Title 18 USC  1546, making, altering, or selling false INS documents (116); Title 18 USC  1546, using or possessing false INS documents (1031); Title 18 USC  371, conspiring to commit an offense or defraud (504); and Title 18 USC  911, making false claims to United States citizenship (7130). CURRENT INS ANTI-FRAUD EFFORTS Although not currently a stand-alone priority of the INS, fraud detection and deterrence is an important component of a Fiscal Year 1997 (FY) priority called ""Improve Adjudicative Services"". In accordance with this priority, the INS implemented a joint application fraud initiative coordinating the INS Offices of Investigations and Benefits. The INS dedicated its enforcement efforts to improving its focus on application fraud by using cross-discipline fraud teams, streamlined fraud indicators, and standardized referral procedures. The initiative further calls for the initiation of three pilots, one per region, in cooperation with the respective INS service center, to conduct one large-scale application fraud case by each pilot. Implementation of the initiative is currently under way. The Service Centers now handle 57 percent of the applications adjudicated by the INS. Additionally, each service center has an operations unit that focuses on detecting document and benefit fraud. Each service center will continue to develop new and/or update existing fraud indicators for use in identifying major application fraud conspiracies. The service centers will refer relating suspect applications and petitions to the appropriate district office for analysis and consideration of investigation. Following the investigation, the pilot district shall refer the investigative findings and the relating applications back to the requesting service center, which will then complete the adjudication of the suspect applications/petitions and place in removal proceedings beneficiaries/applicants of fraudulent petitions/applications. Each pilot office will establish a local fraud team consisting of district adjudications officers, Examinations Fee Account special agents and/or special agents. Fraud team members shall be drawn from the existing workforce, as no additional appropriation has been provided. The INS shall monitor productivity of the fraud teams and analyze data on fraud trends. The effectiveness of the initiative will be instrumental in determining whether or not fraud deterrence should become a standalone priority of the INS in FY 1998. Additionally, the INS has developed a flagging project that, when implemented, will alert INS personnel to possible fraudulent applications and fraud schemes. The flagging project relies upon the interface between two INS databases, the Central Index System (CIS) and the National Automated Immigration Lookout System (NAILS) to update the CIS records with a corresponding NAILS flag that alerts users that there is additional information in the NAILS record. NAILS contains information of persons of interest to INS and other federal agencies for law enforcement purposes. At present, the database contains thousands of records that are identified as persons inadmissible to the United States or ineligible to receive immigration benefits because they are criminals, deported aliens, terrorists, or illegally in the United States. CIS contains current status and historical information on persons of interest to the INS and acts as an index system. When fully implemented the flagging project will encompass those fraudulent records in CIS that involve the illegal purchase of genuine INS documents from INS employees, and those involving the payment or bribe to an INS employee in return for favorable action. CURRENT RESOURCES TO COMBAT FRAUD Currently, the Examinations Fee Account (EFA) authorizes funding for 100 special agents. This funding, however, is not adequate to fully cover the cost of conducting benefit fraud investigations. The annual modular cost to the Investigations Program for one special agent is $142,105. Thus while 100 special agents are authorized to be funded from the EFA, the $9,633,488 available from the EFA for 1997 provides funding for only 84 special agents, 6 supervisory special agents, and no clerks. The Office of Investigations has recommended a restructuring of the EFA so that funding coincides with workload and case cost, and a   yearly review of the EFA to ensure that funding, once adjusted, continues to match case cost and workload. Projections for FY 1997 indicate that investigative time devoted to fraud investigations will be very close to the FY 1996 level of 165 workyears. IMPACT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND IMMIGRANT RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996 (IIRIRA) ON FRAUD The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) carries enhancements which will be helpful in combating fraud as it relates to immigration. Several sections increase criminal penalties; thereby enhancing deterrence as well as increasing the likelihood of prosecution of crimes relating to fraud activities. Document Fraud IIRIRA has increased criminal penalties for fraudulent use of government-issued documents; knowingly presenting a document which fails to contain a reasonable basis in law or fact; and for voting by aliens in a Federal election. IIRIRA has also created new document fraud offenses and added civil penalties for document fraud. Under IIRIRA, fraudulent activities punishable under specific sections of Title 18 United States Code, in relation to the issuance or use of a passport or visa, can result in a criminal forfeiture order for a conveyance or property, either real or personal, which was derived from proceeds or used to facilitate the fraud. These penalties will allow the Service to enhance its ability to bring criminal cases while providing a mechanism for punishing those who might not ever be brought to criminal trial, through civil penalties. Benefit Fraud As well as the increased penalties and punishments noted above for document fraud, IIRIRA will allow the Service to more effectively combat benefit fraud. The addition of a criminal penalty for ""failure to disclose role as preparer of false application for immigration benefits"" acknowledges the role of those unscrupulous individuals who would flaunt our laws for personal gain. The criminal penalties put in place by IIRIRA for false claims to United States citizenship in procurement of employment or governmental benefits is a powerful means to combating benefit fraud as well and where cases can be proven the Service will prosecute. New Tools IIRIRA also authorizes the Service to utilize the investigative and statutes and the investigative technique of ""wire taps"" in pursuing investigative tools added to the authority to subpoena records and tool will greatly enhance the Service's arsenal in deterring and pro CONCLUSION The nation's right to determine who may cross its borders, and preserving the integrity of that process, is defended by fraud investigations. INS controls the admission of aliens to the United States. The pervasive fraud which exists reflects the continuing desire of foreign nationals to emigrate to the United States by any means possible. Discouraging immigration fraud and protecting the integrity of INS benefits and documents legitimately provided to authorized aliens continues to be an INS priority. Special Agents continue to vigorously pursue counterfeit document manufacturers, vendors, and INS benefit fraud facilitators. ADDENDUM The following cases represent the range of INS fraud investigations conducted at a single INS district office during the past eighteen months. They indicate the broad spectrum of fraud being perpetrated on INS, as prosecutorial strengths of the RICO fraud crime. These two major persons in fraud cases as an investigative secuting fraud violations.   well as the ingenuity and flexibility of aliens and those facilitators and attorneys providing fraudulent services to aliens. OPERATION CHESTNUT An upstate New York bodega owner, who was to become a U.S. citizen only one day after his arrest, was charged with visa fraud and conspiracy. NY investigators acted on a tip from the U.S. Postal Service that packages containing spurious sheets of green cards, Social Security cards and laminates were being delivered to the store via a Los Angeles connection. A controlled delivery was made, and subsequent search and arrest warrants were executed. During the search, dozens of fraudulent cards and laminates were discovered. The owner's naturalization application was pulled immediately after his arrest, and pending the outcome of the government's case against him, deportation proceedings will be initiated. The owner's brother was also arrested in the operation. In December 1996, NY INS agents flew to California to arrest the lawful permanent resident who had sent the fraudulent cards to the New York vendor, for visa fraud, conspiracy and mail fraud. A consent to search was authorized, and agents recovered phone records documenting ties to the New York owner. OPERATION RICO This operation involved a document vendor whose modus operandi was to establish a business, and then send out scouts to recruit illegal aliens who wanted to purchase fraudulent documents or to file fraudulent paperwork with INS. The vendor charged $250 for a bogus green card/Social Security Card package; $6,000 for fraudulent filing Adjustment of Status packages; and $500 for filing false political asylum applications. The sole reason for filing false paperwork with INS was to obtain legitimate employment authorization while the application was pending. The arranger would periodically shut the business down and open up elsewhere under a new name. This vendor had been in operation for over three years, and had established at least four businesses in 1996 alone. Three persons were arrested in this operation, and all have plead guilty. OPERATION WATSON A Queens-based counterfeit document ring, whose members used bicycles to hand off orders in an attempt to avoid pursuit by federal investigators, was recently broken up by New York agents. The ring supplied counterfeit sets of green cards and Social Security Cards to unauthorized aliens who used the documents to work illegally. The customers paid $100 per set of cards after providing a photo and the biographical data to be printed on the cards. New York investigators utilized bicycles to follow the couriers of the fraudulent cards to detect the actual location where the cards were being manufactured. A search warrant was executed and the subsequent arrests of two co-conspirators followed. Over 100 sheets of documents were recovered, along with the seizure of a camera, typewriter, and two laminating machines used to create the cards--as well as a bicycle used by one of the couriers. Two arrest warrants remain outstanding, and agents believe that two subjects have fled the United States. WEST AFRICAN TASK FORCE Based on analytical comparisons through the INS Forensic Document Laboratory's Document Link Identification System, a new type of fraudulent document-producing machine was discovered which manufactured spurious I-551s (green cards) which were then distributed in the New York area for $500. Working with the U.S. Secret Service's West African Task Force, NY Investigations located, arrested, and indicted the distributor of the documents. OPERATION PENGUIN A Brooklyn-based fingerprint/immigration assistance agency has served as a sophisticated front for an illicit operation which deliberately filed I-485 Adjustment of Status Applications without any of the required supporting documentation necessary for applicants to legitimately apply for a government issued work card. The New York District's employment authorization unit alerted Investigations after noting that   numerous individuals were filing for work authorization without the required documents substantiating a legitimately pending I-485 application. The owner of the business was recently arrested on fraud charges. OPERATION VULTURE NEST A Manhattan-based attorney was arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud INS after a 15-month investigation based on the attorney's alleged scheme to file fraudulent employment-based green card applications with inflated company figures. The reason for inflating the figures (which included the number of employees, the year in which each company was established, as well as the gross and net annual company income) was to make INS believe the companies were more lucrative than they actually were. The attorney included fraudulent documentation with the applications, including fraudulent tax returns and company stock certificates. He was arraigned and released on bond. The case was opened after a referral from the Vermont Service Center (VSC). OPERATION RED An upstate-New York agency legitimately operated as a money order/phone center/fingerprint/immigration assistance business. But, behind the scene, they provided fraudulent supporting documentation for nonexistent I-485s (Adjustment of Status applications) in support of I-765s (Applications for Work Authorization). The district's employment authorization unit alerted Investigations after numerous applicants submitted identical photocopies of a single INS cash register receipt. The receipt serves as proof that an alien has filed a legitimate adjustment of status application. Enough information was gleaned by NY investigators to justify a search and arrest warrant against the owner and her company. She was subsequently arrested and is currently awaiting trial. OPERATION XENON In a case so prominent that it was featured in The Washington Post last November, a Manhattan-based attorney and three of his clients were targeted in an international plot to fly United States citizen women to Bangladesh to engage in sham marriages to Bangladeshi men willing to pay $30,000. This arrangement ultimately enables the groom to obtain permanent residence in the United States. For two years, the NY INS office has been working closely with the U.S. Department of State in this investigation. Three of the four subjects have already been arrested (including the attorney). The primary subject, however, absconded when he became aware that INS had arrested his three coconspirators. OPERATION GOLF CLUB A fraud ring consisting of marriage arrangers has orchestrated approximately 300 suspected fraudulent marriages to secure permanent residence for men from Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon, Algeria, Jordan, and China. NY investigators, working with Boston, Newark, and Providence agents, arrested nine individuals, including a United States citizen attorney. All five defendants arrested in New England have pled guilty, while the trial for the remaining four defendants arrested in New York and New Jersey has been set for June 10, 1997. OPERATION CYPHER Political asylum cases are sensitive in nature, as applicants are seeking refuge in the United States for fear of persecution in their homelands. Those who commit asylum fraud take away from legitimate asylum seekers in that they serve to clog the system and create tremendous backlogs on the interview calendar. NY Investigations takes asylum fraud very seriously, and Operation Cypher is turning out to be a major victory in combating such fraud. Five arrest warrants have been issued, and four individuals have been taken into custody, with the last subject remaining a fugitive. In September 1996, three of the subjects were indicted, including a Manhattan-based attorney, who filed hundreds of bogus, boiler-plate asylum applications for profits ranging from $300 to $800 per application. OPERATION ARROW   This operation saw the arrest of an immigration attorney, and three of his associates on charges that they prepared and filed thousands of fraudulent political asylum applications, labor certifications, nonimmigrant visa applications, and suspension of deportation cases. Expelled from practicing law in New York, the attorney had continued to practice law under the auspices of another attorney to whom he sold his law firm. OPERATION ZEPHYR Three prominent New York attorneys and two of their secretaries were arrested prolific scheme of filing over 1,500 fraudulent asylum applications. One attorne conspiracy to file fraudulent INS applications, and the two other attorneys have defraud the United States, conspiracy to file fraudulent INS applications, and to concealing a material fact/false statements. OPERATION INDIAN TRAIL Nine individuals have been arrested in this H-1B (temporary work visa) fraud/smuggling operation involving hundreds of aliens smuggled into the United States. Fronting as a legitimate investment firm from the former Soviet Union, the proprietors of the operation filtered H-1B applications through the Vermont Service Center, ultimately obtaining temporary work permits for illicit applicants. With work permits, beneficiaries could then seek employment anywhere without suspicion from employers. The last of the nine subjects was arrested in April 1996. Eight of the nine have already pled guilty to charges ranging from fraudulent statements; conspiracy; visa fraud; establishing a commercial enterprise evading immigration laws; and smuggling. One subject remains a fugitive from justice. OPERATION HOME NY investigators focused on this group of individuals who smuggled females out of the former Soviet Union and into the United States, where they were put to work as domestics for U.S. families. The women entered the United States with B-2 visas obtained by fraudulent statements, but surrendered their passports to the smugglers upon entry into the country. The smugglers held the women's passports for ransom until each woman paid a smuggling fee of between $2,000 to $2,500. Three principals have been arrested, and two have already pled guilty to alien smuggling charges. Charges are still pending against the third. OPERATION SCOOBY New York INS agents, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State, have uncovered an operation which has been exploiting the State Department's DV-1 Diversity Visa Lottery Program. Under the program, natives of certain countries are allowed to file for permanent residence, but each applicant may only file one application. Three subjects of this investigation have filed over one hundred applications for the program by utilizing different names. To date, two of the subjects have been arrested. OPERATION YO-YO This large-scale investigation broke up a network which was involved in passport, marriage, and legalization fraud. Thus far, six co-conspirators have been arrested, and execution of a search warrant has resulted in the seizure of thousands of fraudulently-prepared immigration documents. This ring had fraudulently obtained lawful permanent resident status for two aliens recently convicted on charges of terrorism. for participating in the y has pled guilty to pled guilty to conspiracy to knowingly and willfully"
GX263-44-7416097	"In the Supreme Court of Georgia  Decided: March 27, 2003  S02A169 9. HINES v. THE STATE.  FLETCHER, Chief Justi ce.  While hunting, Robert Lee Hines mistook his friend Steven Wood for a turkey and shot him dead. A jury convicted Hines of felony murder based on the underlying crime of posses sion of a firearm by a convicted felon, but acquitted him of felony murder based on the underlying felony of misuse of a firearm while hunting. On appeal, Hines contends that the jury's verdict is invalid because the jury cannot acquit him of killing the victim by misusing a firear m, yet convict him of killing the victim by possession of the same fire arm, without having made inconsistent factual findings. Because Georgia does not recognize an inconsist ent verdict rule and Hines's other enumerations are witho ut merit , we affir m.1 The crime was committed on April 8 , 2001. On Aug ust 7, 200 1, a grand jury indicted Hines for two counts of felony murder, possession of a 1   Taken in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict of guilty, the evidence at trial showed that, late in the afternoon of April 8, 2001, Hines and some of his friends and relatives went turkey hunting. They split into two groups, with Hines and h is friend Rand y Stoker hun ting togeth er in one area, and the victim, the victim's wif e, and Hines's son hunting in a diff erent area, approximately one-fourth mile away. As the sky was growing dark, Hines heard a turkey gobble, ""saw it fan out and shot."" Hines's shot went through heavy foliage and hit the victim approximately eighty feet away. Immediately  thereafter, the victim's wife screamed, ""You shot Wood."" Hines and his son went for help, b ut the victim died b efore help coul d arrive.  firearm by a convicted felon, misuse of a firearm while hunting, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, tampering with evidence, and four counts of false statement. The State withdrew three of the false statement counts. On August 31, 2001, the jury acquitted Hines of one count of felony murder and convicted him of all remaining counts. The trial court merged the felon in possession conviction into the felony murder conviction and sentenced Hines to life imprisonment for felony murder followed by five years imprisonment for the possession of a firearm while committing a felony conviction. The court also imposed concurrent sentences on the remaining convictions. Hines moved for a new trial on September 21, 2001, and amended his motion on March 14, 2002. The trial court denied the motion for a new trial on March 26, 2002. Hines filed his notice of appeal on April 23, 2002. The case was docketed in this Court on July 22, 2002 and submitted for decision on September 16, 2002. 2   On his return, Hines tried to convince his son and Stoker to take responsibility for the shooting. They both refused. The entire group, however, agreed to say that they did not know wh o had shot Wood. Hines removed his camouflage clothing and hid his shotgun and hunting gear before the police arrived. Two days later, Hines admitted he had shot Woo d and showed the police where he had hidden h is shotgu n. Hines's son showed the po lice where he had hidden Hines's hunting cl othing and gear, which included unopened cans of beer. An open beer can and foam insulation wrap that belonged to Hines was found near wh ere Hines had fired the fatal shot. 1. We conclude that t he evidence at trial was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to have fo und Hines g uilty beyond a reaso nable doub t of the crimes for which he was convicted.2 2. The jury acquitted Hines of felony murder based on misuse of a firearm while hunting and convicted him of felony murder based on possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Hines contends that the verdict is void because the  2  See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) 3  (1979).   jury made inconsistent determinations th at he did not cause Wood's death by misusi ng a fi rearm, bu t did c ause hi s death by pos sessi ng th e same fire arm. Georgia does not recognize an inconsistent verdict rule,3 which would permit a defendant to challenge the factual findings underlying a guilty verdict on one count as inconsistent with the findings underlying a not guilty verdict on a different count. A conviction on one count and acquittal on another related count may reflect a compromise or lenity by the jury rather than inconsistent factual conclusions, and Georgia courts generally will not look behind the jury's decision to convict on certain counts and acquit on other counts.4 Therefore, Hines's enumeration is without merit. 3. Hines contends that a convicted felon's possession of a firearm while turkey hunting cannot be one of the inherently dangerous felonies required to support a conviction for felony murder. ""The only limitation on th e type of felony that may serve as an underlying felony for a felony murder conviction is  Lawrence v. State, 274 Ga. 794, 794 (560 SE2d 17) (2002); see also Jackson v. State, No. S02A1837, 2003 WL 396302, *1 n.3 (Ga. Feb. 24, 2003). Jackson, at *1, n.3; Dumas v.

State,8 the defendant was a convicted felon who was unloading a handgun wh en it accidentally disch arged, went thro ugh the flo or, and killed an occupant of the apartment below. A jury convicted Ford for felony murder based on his felonious possession of a firearm. This Court reversed, finding that, because no evidence showed the defendant knew there was an apartment below him or that the victim was present, his possession of a firearm could not support a conviction for felony murder.9  5 6 7  Hulme v. State, 273 Ga. 676, 678 (544 SE2d 138) (2001). Id.  See, e.g., Metts v. State, 270 Ga. 481, 482 (511 SE2d 508) (1999) (felon in p ossession of firearm inherent ly dangerous when defendant pointed loaded, cocked gun at window when he knew person was standing on the other side). 8 9  262 Ga. 602 (423 SE2d 255) (1992). Id. at 602-03. 5   In contrast to Ford, Hines intentionally fired his shotgun intending to hit his target. He had been drink ing before h e went huntin g, and there was evidence that he had been drinking while hunting. He knew that other hunters were in the area and was unaware of their exact location. He also knew that other people visited the area in which he was hunting. He took an unsafe shot at dusk, through heavy foliage, at a target eighty feet away that he had not positively identified as a turkey. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Hines's illegal possession of a firearm created a foreseeable risk of death.10 Accordingly, Hines's violation of the prohibition against convicted felons possessing firearms was an inherently dangerous felony that could support a felony murder conviction. 4. Hines claims that the trial court improperly allowed a lay witness to offer an expert opinion that went to the ultimate issue before the jury regarding whether Hines misused a firearm whi le hunting. At trial, the S tate offered Department of Natural Resources Ranger Greg Hall as an expert o n hunter  See also Metts, 270 Ga. at 482; Chapman v. State, 266 Ga. 356, 35758 (467 SE2d 497) (1996) (misuse of firearm while hunting is an inherently dangerous felony that will support felony murder). 6  10   safety and turkey hunting. The trial court refused to recognize Hall as an expert in those areas, but allowed him to testify that he would not teach students in his hunter safety class es that Hines's s hot was ""permiss ible or allowabl e."" Lay witnesses [] ""may state their opini on only when it is based upon their own observations,"" and their opinions are admissible ""only when it is necessary in order for a witness to convey those same observatio ns to the jur y.""11 A lay witness may not state his o pinion wh en the facts relied up on by the witnes s can be ""clearly described for the jury, and the jury can rely upon those same facts and reach its own opinion .""12 ""Otherwise, by stating an opinion the jury could reach for itself, the lay witness is deemed to have invaded the jury's exclusive provisio n."" 13  Hall's opinion that he would not teach hunter safety students that Hines's shot was ""permissible o r allowable"" was not a p roper lay opinion because it was not necessary to convey Hall' s observatio ns. Rather, Hall drew a conclusion based on his experience in hunter safety instruction regarding a matter that was 11 12 13  Johnson v. Knebel, 267 Ga. 853, 855-56 (485 SE2d 451) (1997). Id. at 857. Id. 7   not within the ken of the average juror (i.e., that Hines's shot would not be taught as a permissible sho t in hunter safety classes). Therefore, Hall's testimony was admissible only as an expert opinion. However, Hall's experience and credentials were sufficient to qualify him to offer an expert opinion regarding whether Hines's shot was permissible un der hunter safety standards. Hall was a certified Georgia law enforcement officer, employed by the Department of Natural Resources in the law enforcement section of its Wildlife Resources Division. He h ad five years of exp erience teaching hunter safety courses, and his duties included enforcement of Georgia's hunting laws. The jury heard these qualifications, and Hines had an opportunity to cross-examine Hall regarding his qualifications as well as the substance of his testimony. Additionall y, Hall's testimony was p robative of whether Hines misused his firearm while hu nting, but did not invade the jury's exclusive province to determine whether Hines was guilty of that crime. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in allowing Hall to offer his opinion.14  See generally Henry v. State, 265 Ga. 732, 736-37 (462 SE2d 737) (1995) (interpreter offered expert opinion although not offered as expert witness); Stewart v. State, 246 Ga. 70, 75 (268 SE2d 906) (1980) (court implicitly recognized witness's expert status when it overruled objection to 8  14   5. Hines asserts that the evidence did not authorize the jury to reject his mistake of fact defense. Under OCGA  16-3-5, ""a person shall not be found guilty of a crime if the act or omission to act constitu ting the crime was ind uced by a misapprehension of fact which, if tr ue, would have ju stified the act or omission."" Generally, however, ""ignorance or mistake of fact constitutes a defense to a criminal charge only if it is not superinduced by the fault or negligence of the party doing the wrongful act.""15 Here, Hines's mistaken b elief that Wood was a turkey was due to his own fault in taking an unsafe shot under unsafe conditions at a target that he had not po sitively ident ified as legal game. Accordingly, the jury was authorized to reject Hines's mistake of fact defense. 6. Hines's remaining enumerations are also without merit. (A). The trial court did not commit reversible error in permitting the medical examiner to testify that he had classified Wood's death as a ""homicide."" The medical examiner testified the classification had nothing to do with the  obviously competent witness's expert testimony); Bacon v. State, 225 Ga. App. 326, 327-29 (483 SE2d 894) (1997) (same).

State, 267 Ga. 543, 544 (480 SE2d 573) (1997) (internal punctuation omitted). 9 15   defendant's intent and meant only that ""but for the actions of another individual"" the decedent would not be dead.16 (B). Because the felon in p ossession of a firearm charge was an  underlying felony for one of the felony murd er counts, the tr ial court correctly denied Hines's motion to bifurcate the possession charge from the trial of the other charges.17 (C). The trial court did not commit reversible error in leaving in the indictment the references to Hines's habitual violator status and prior conviction for driving under the influence. Hines withdrew the motion to redact his habitual violator status from the indictment, and the reference to the DUI conviction was harmless because Hines referred to his DUI conviction in his statement to the police, which was introduced into evidence without objection.18 (D). The trial court was within its discretion in admitting the photographs of the deceased.19  16 17 18 19  See Willis v. State, 274 Ga. 699, 701 (558 SE2d 393) (2002). See Haynes v.

Ranger Hall's testimony regarding the hunter safety courses that he teaches did not elevate the standard under OCGA  16-11-108 (misuse of a firearm while hunting) from a reasonable person standard to a reasonable person who has taken h unter safety courses standard. The trial court's instructions to the jury followed the statutory language, and ""absent clear evidence to the contrary,"" ""qualified j urors un der oath"" are presumed to follow the trial court's instructions.20 (F). Hines waived any objection to the trial court's omission of the general charge on the form of the verdict because he did not r equest the charge, and based on the charg es that were given, its omission was not clearly harmful and erroneous as a matter of law.21 (G). The trial court did not commit reversible error when it attempted to clarify the jury's continuing confusion regarding the crime of misuse of a  See Smith v.

The trial court did not err in recharging the jury on only the felony murder/misuse of a firearm counts, when those were the counts on which the jury had questions.23 Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur, except Sears, P.J., who dissents.  22 23  See Willingham v. State, 268 Ga. 64, 66 (485 SE2d 735) (1997).  See Duffie v.

HINES v. THE STATE.  SEARS, Presiding Justice, dissenting. Because I conclude that circu mstances surrounding Hines's commission of the status felony of possessing a firearm were not inherently dangerous within the meaning of our decision in Ford v. St ate,1 I dissent to the majority's affirmance of Hines's conviction of felony murder . In Ford, this Court held that for a felony to serve as the basis for a felony murder conviction, it had to be inherently dang erous by its v ery nature or had to be committed under circumstances creating a foreseeable risk of death.2 We also held that the imputation of malice that justifies the felony murder rule is dependent on the ""perpetrator's life-threatening state of mind accompanying  1 2  262 Ga. 602 ( 423 SE2d 255) (19 92).

Hansen , 885 P2d 1 022, 102 6 (Cal. 1994) . 7 6 5  Patterson, 778 P2d at 5 58. 2   In the present case, I conclud e that the posses sion of a fir earm by Hines was not committed in a fashion that was inherently dangerous and that carried a high probability that death would result. The fact that Hines was hu nting, a dangerous sport; the fact that he had been drinking before he went hunting; the fact that he was hunt ing at dusk ; and the fact that h e fired a shot wh en he knew other hunters were in the general area in which he was hunting may establish that Hines was negligent, but do not establish that his acts created a high probability that death to a human being would result, or that he had a ""lifethreatening state of mind.""8 Moreover, as for the fatal shot, Hines tes tified that he heard a turkey gobb le, that he ""saw it fan o ut,"" and that he th en fired at the object. Even though Hines may not, as stated by the majority, have positively identified his target as a turkey, he had to make a split-second decision regarding his target and concluded, based on hearing a gobble and seeing something ""fan out,"" that the object was a tu rkey. I cannot conclu de that, under these circumstances, the failure of the hunter to identify his target beyond doubt carried a high probability that a human being woul d be killed or that he acted  8  Ford, 262 Ga. at 603. 3   with a ""life-th reatening state of mind.""  9  The death in this case is clearly a  tragic incident, and Hines' s conduct befo re and after the sho oting was reprehensib le. But the sanction of life in prison fo r murder shou ld be reserved for cases in which the def endant's moral fail ings warrant such punishment. Here, the application of the felony murder statute to Hines's actions punishes him more severely than his culpability merits. In this regard, Hines will be serving the same punishment -- life in prison -- as an arsonist convicted of felony murder who firebombed an apartment that he knew was occupied, causing the death of two young children,10 and the same punish ment as an armed robber convicted of felony murder who entered a store with a firearm and shot and killed a store emplo yee.11 This result is unwarranted and unn ecessary, as  Id. See also Cable v. Commonwealth, 415 SE2d 218 (Va. 1992) (under circumstances similar to present case, defendant was convicted of involun tary manslaughter; h is convictio n was affirmed on app eal, but the dissent, taking the position that no crime had been committed, noted that the Supreme Court o f Virginia had only decided on e other case (also an involun tary manslaughter case) d ealing with hu nting accidents ). 10 11  9  Wolfe v. State, 273 Ga. 670 (544 SE2d 148) (2001). Taylor v. State, 275 Ga. 461(569 SE2d 520) (2002). 4   Hines could be pro secuted and conv icted of an appro priate lesser crime, such as involun tary manslaughter12 or the misuse of a firearm while hunting.13 One final note. Hun ting is a time-ho nored recreational activity  encouraged by the State of Georgia and enjoyed by many of our State's citizens. No doubt a number of hunters have probably engaged in negligent hunting practices similar to those in this case. Although I do not condone such careless practices, neither can I agree with subjecting so many hunters to the possibility of spending life in prison when they do not fastidiously follow proper hunting procedures and accidentally shoot a fellow hunter. For the for egoing reaso ns, I dissen t to the majority op inion.  12 13  OCGA  16-5-3.  OCGA  16-11-108. Hines was in fact convicted of this crime in the present case. 5"
GX033-99-13807230	December 8, 2003    COUNTERFEIT DOCUMENT RINGLEADER  SENTENCED TO 5 YEARS   Operations Based At Chicagos Mega Mall     CHICAGO  The ringleader of a $240,000-per-year counterfeit-document ring operating at Chicagos Mega Mall was sentenced Friday for his role in providing fake identity documents to illegal aliens. U.S. District Court Judge David H. Coar sentenced Taurino Armando Brito-Sotelo, 36, to 63 months in prison, according to Elissa A. Brown, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago office of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Patrick Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.    Counterfeit document production is a precursor to a myriad of crimes that defraud local and state institutions of significant revenue and undermine our national security, said Elissa A. Brown, Special Agent-in-Charge of ICE in Chicago. ICE is committed to making the largest possible impact through our investigations to disrupt and dismantle this criminal activity.    Brito-Sotelo and his co-conspirators were the targets of a year-long investigation conducted by ICE agents into a major counterfeit-document ring operating at the Mega Mall, a discount shopping center located at 2500 N. Milwaukee in Chicago. During the investigation, undercover ICE agents purchased counterfeit identity documents at the Mega Mall, including fake green cards and social security cards. It was determined that ringleader Brito-Sotelo, an illegal alien himself, received a $50 cut from each set of documents made and sold, with an estimated 3 to 5 sets purchased each day.     Counterfeit identity documents sell on the street for approximately $80 per set, which includes a fake social security card and green card, and are routinely manufactured and sold to undocumented aliens who use them to gain unlawful employment and conceal their true identity. Fraudulent documents are also sold and purchased to evade the law by developing multiple identities. As part of the conspiracy, the documents were produced at various locations in Chicago, including 2953 W. Fullerton, transported back to the Mega Mall, and sold to illegal aliens.      In January 2003, ICE agents arrested Brito-Sotelo and three other vendors and seized several hundred counterfeit green cards and social security cards. A fifth individual was arrested on December 4.
