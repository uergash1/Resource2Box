Doris     was a home economics teacher and an at home mother who used and demonstrated functional, high-quality kitchen tools     and equipment. She found that the kitchen tools available in shops were not of the quality available to her as a     professional and some tools were not well designed. Doris also found that salespeople sometimes did not know a great     deal about kitchen products. From this the idea of designed quality and functional kitchen products and created the     company The Pampered Chef.                Doris wanted her products to be shown in homes around America, by housewives to their friends and family. Customers    would be able to see the products demonstrated, use them before purchase and then buy the items there and then. She    quickly achieved this with the help and support of her husband, Jay, and their two young daughters, Julie and Kelley.        Soon her homeware products were selling not only throughout the USA but worldwide, including    here in the United Kingdom. The UK distribution network started in 1999 and continues to grow in strength thanks     to hard working Pampered Chef Consultants who sell their high-quality kitchen tools. Over 55,000 Pampered Chef Consultants    work around the world including countries such as Germany, Britain, America and Canada. All Pampered Chef products    have at least a one year guarantee.         You can easily join The Pampered Chef and start earning money with hours to suit your family and social     needs .                 Items you can sell include baking cutters, tableware, oven mitts, cake tester, mixing bowls, rice cookers, stir fry skillets,    recipe cookbooks, peelers, whisks, serving sets, cookware, stoneware collections and much, much more. If you allow a Pampered    Chef Consultant to host a party, which is called a cooking show, in your home you can claim free items from their catalogue. This gives you a chance     to observe a trained employee (independent consultant) of Pampered Chef in action and to learn their selling skills first hand.  Consultants can also demonstrate the Pampered Chef multi purpose kitchen tools. In addition the consultant can show easy recipes that offer dramatic results and simple mealtime preparation techniques that make cooking quick, easy and fun!           Become An Independant Consultant with The Pampered Chef     Become an independent consultant in The Pampered Chef  and you will benefit from being your own boss: working hours to suit you, your family and social life. Other benefits include:        Earn Money     Free training and support     Free Pampered Chef products     Free award gifts such as holidays, sapphire and diamond jewellery for top sales achievers     Meeting new friends                Working for The Pampered Chef would suit a variety of people such as men or women with children who want a job    that is flexible around child care, retired people and those with a passion for cooking and being in the kitchen.     Pampered Chef work could be the opportunity you have been looking for, whether to supplement your existing income or to enable you to make a life changing career decision.    Income from The Pampered Chef should be declared to your Tax Office on your self assessment form. You may be able     to claim tax relief from expenses such as travelling, car mileage, telephone calls and the Pampered Chef start up kit.            The Pampered Chef Start Up Kit     You will need to buy The Pampered Chef start up kit, which is about 00, and includes stationery and business     materials for the shows. You are obligated to complete at least six shows in your first year. Expenses thereafter    are the catalogues and invitations, though these can go on your income tax expense sheet. There are no other hidden    charges or costs, though some Pampered Chef Consultants give out free food and drink to their customers and get a return    on this by seeing an increase in sales.

Pampered Chef Shows     Shows can be held in friends and family's homes, local pubs, clubs and village halls - use your local contacts    and build up a friendly fun rapport with your clients to keep them as spending customers. If people love your shows    and have a fun day or night out they will come back with more friends and family and your income will grow. Do pass    out business cards with your contact details so that people can easily contact you and book a Pampered Chef show.         You do not need to keep stock at home, other than the demonstration items - some sales Consultants even use these    in their own kitchens between shows. After you have taken the orders you place the order on-line and the products are shipped   directly to the host of the show so there are no deliveries to do.      There are few downsides to being a Pampered Chef Sales Consultant. The only thing I can think of is that you have    to overcome any fear of public speaking. However this can be fun and many people grow to love talking about the products    and having a laugh with groups of new friends - whilst earning money.

Perhaps the oldest oats grain was found in Egypt among remains of the 12th Dynasty, which was about 2000BC. The oldest known cultivated oats were found in cave in Switzerland that are believed belong to Bronze Age. They were the last of the major cereal grains to be domesticated, around 3,000 years ago in Europe,  Greeks and Romans considered oats to be nothing more than a diseased version of wheat. Oats were a lowly horse food for the Romans, who scoffed at the ""oat-eating barbarians"", or those pesky Germanic tribes who eventually toppled the West Roman Empire.     The history of oats is somewhat clouded because there are so many different species and subspecies, which makes identification of old remains very difficult. The chief modern center of greatest variety of form is in Asia Minor.   Oats were first brought to North America with other grains in 1602 and planted on the Elizabeth Islands off the coast of Massachusetts. As early as 1786, George Washington sowed 580 acres to oats. By the 1860s and 1870s, the westward shift of oat acreage in the United States had moved into the middle and upper Mississippi  Valley, which is its major area of production today.

But the man who gave the hamburger its contemporary look and sought to expand the products appeal through chain operations was J. Walter Anderson, a Wichita, Kan., resident who went on to co-found the White Castle Hamburger system, the oldest continuously running burger chain. However, there is a history that in late eighteenth century, the largest port in Europe was in Germany. Sailors who visited port brought special food called “Hamburg steak” as a popular usage. It was a hard slab of salted minced beef, often slightly smoked, mixed with onions and breadcrumbs. Immigrants arriving England at that time also bring new food with consist of chopped beef, suet, and spices. The other famous story is that Charlie Nagreen of Wisconsin, at age 15, sold hamburgers from his ox-drawn food stand at the Outagamie County Fair. He went to the Outagamie County Fair and set up a stand selling meatballs. Business wasn't good and he quickly realized that it was because meatballs were too difficult to eat while strolling around the fair. In a flash of innovation, he flattened the meatballs, placed them between two slices of bread and called his new creation a hamburger. He was known to many as ""Hamburger Charlie."" He returned to sell hamburgers at the fair every year until his death in 1951.

Wheat flour, believed to originate in the Middle East, serves as the basis of the first “noodles.” 300 The Chinese form whole grain paste into various noodle-like products. 500-600 Amidst numerous cultural exchanges, China shares Buddhism and the art of noodle-making with Japan. Buckwheat noodles become a staple of the Japanese tea ceremony. 1138 Arab geographer, Idrisi, travels to Sicily and writes about “triyah,” a food resembling threads and produced in large quantities. 1700 The very first spaghetti is produced in Napoli,  Italy. 1800 Japanese specialty shops create noodles, similar to those eaten today, but requiring considerable preparation time and effort. It is believed that noodles originated from China as early as 5000 BC, then spread to other Asian countries. Today, about 40% of the flour consumed in Asia is for Noodle manufacture. In recent years, noodles have also become very popular outside Asia and this popularity is likely to increase. The relationship between noodles and pasta also goes back more than 700 years. It is believed that in the late 13th century, Marco Polo traveled to China and brought noodles back to Italy to add to his country's repertoire of pasta.

That story is over 1000 years old so the history of coriander as an aphrodisiac dates back far into history. Coriander has been used as an “appetite” stimulant. Its dried seed produce a euphoric effect, especially in women. The seed of the well known Coriandrum sativum is known as coriander. The coriander is derived from the Greek word koris. It means bedbug. This due the unripe seeds and leaves when crushed has a smell suggestive of a crushed bedbug. Coriander is used in condiments, dessert, liqueurs perfumes and candies. Generally it thought to be from Mediterranean and parts of southwestern Europe. It is believed to be sued since 5,000 BC. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks believed coriander had aphrodisiacal properties.

Its use as a food and as medicinal stimulant is lost in history. The roasting of coffee beans to give the aroma and flavor, which is universally recognized and appreciated, started during the 13th century and the quality of the aromatic profile is still a matter of expertise in carrying out this process.  Coffee is a large evergreen shrub of which Coffee Arabica, L. and C.robusta, L. are the most important commercial species existing in many varieties. Several other species are encountered but these are of less importance; the flavor of these beans is generally considered to be less coarse, bitter and much less acceptable than that of C.arabica.

Of course, this statement is based largely upon imperfect records, perhaps, in many cases only hints more or less doubtful as to the various species. But it seems safe to conclude that a goodly number of the herbs discussed in this volume, especially those said to be natives of the Mediterranean region, overhung and perfumed the cradle of the human race in the Orient and marked the footsteps of our rude progenitors as they strode more and more sturdily toward the horizon of promise. This idea seems to gain support also from the fact that certain Eastern peoples, whom modern civilization declares to have uneducated tastes, still employ many herbs which have dropped by the wayside of progress, or like the caraway and the redoubtable ""pusley,"" an anciently popular pot herb, are but known in western lands as troublesome weeds.  Relying upon Biblical records alone, several herbs were highly esteemed prior to our era; in the gospels of Matthew and Luke reference is made to tithes of mint, anise, rue, cumin and other ""herbs""; and, more than 700 years previously, Isaiah speaks of the sowing and threshing of cumin which, since the same passage also speaks of ""fitches"" (vetches), wheat, barley and ""rie"" (rye), seems then to have been a valued crop.

Somehow it looked and tasted like lard. Its original name was discovered by the person name Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1813. It was in 1869  Louis Napoleon 111 offered special prize for anybody that can make a substitute for butter, which would suitably for use of army and lower class caste. Margarine naturally appears white due to forbidding of artificial coloring agents. Ban on coloration became common at that time around the world for nearly 100years. Post war and after great depression, margarine coloring restrictions were lifted.  Modern margarine producer has made a lot of changes. Modern margarine can be made from variety of animals or vegetable fats .

It is essentially a fat of milk. Butter is used as a spread and condiment, as well as in cooking applications. Butter started in Mesopotamian some where between 9000 and 8000 before century. At that time butter was made from sheep or goat’s milk. For ancient Greek and Rome butter is considered a food fit for barbarians. In Northern Europe, butter was also used to prevent kidney and bladder stones. The ancient dwellers of India relating to butter making, dating back to 1500-200BC when Hindus of that time gave young married couple a ‘bridal feast’ consisting of milk, honey and butter. Until the 19th century, majority of butter was made by hand. In 1860s, first butter appeared in United States. Now a days margarine is taken over butter consumption due to less expensive and perceived as being healthier.

It is named after the flightless Kiwi bird of New Zealand, although its origins are in Yangtze Valley of China. The original designation of Chinese gooseberry is also misleading, since it is not a true member of the gooseberry family. Kiwi fruits actually grow on woody vines, much like grapes. During the early 1900s, Isabel Fraser, a director of a New Zealand school visited China and became fascinated with the fruit known at the time as a Chinese gooseberry. She brought back several fruit-bearing vines for her gardener to cultivate. Eventually the fruit became so popular that commercial growers became interested. In order to establish an association with New Zealand, marketers changed the name to ""Kiwifruit"". Kiwi fruit actually get name from marketing strategy, kiwi, and the national bird of New Zealand.  In 1996, New Zealand Kiwi fruit industry re branded the kiwi fruit as Zespri.  In United States, commercial planting began late  1960s in California. From 50 acres in 1970, the industry in California had grown to more than 8,000 acres by1988.

Those who dwelt inland could enjoy fresh water fish such as salmon, trout, eel and pike. One of their ingenious inventions was the gorge – a baited sliver of bone attached to a line of leather or sinew. When a fish took the bait the gorge stuck in its throat and it was hauled in nets made from plant fibers or leather, have not survived, but the existence of small, grooved stones that could have been net weights suggest that nets were in use.  Fishers also invented the leister, a three pronged spear. A fish was impaled on the central straight prong and curved prongs on either side stopped it wriggling off.  In the spring the salmon raced upstream to spawn. This was a gastronomic bonanza for Cro-Magnons, as huge deposits of scales and bones found in some places confirm. Salmon could be speared as they struggle through the shallows, and the crafty Cro-Magnons may well have piled up stones to form a trap. The fish would swim through the funnel-like entrance into pool from which there was no exit, except on the prongs a leister. Much of the catch was then dried or smoked and stored.

However certain people believe that watermelon to have originated from desert  of Kalahari. The famous traveler name David Livingstone reported that saying, at that time there were a lot of watermelon field at that area. According to him, there was a lot of watermelon plant grow without anybody notice of it taste. Once many people know their healths benefit and have a very good taste, it became popular and the watermelon fields slowly expand to other countries of Africa. However, the first written history of watermelon, it comes from Egypt 5,000 years ago. Watermelons were often place in the burial tombs in order to nourish them afterlife. From Egypt watermelon spread to other countries along Sea of Mediterranean by way of trading ships.  Watermelon spread to Europe through Moors people at 13th century.

Probably the men did most of the hunting for the very practical reason that most adult women would have small children to care of – a crying baby would scare off the game before had even started. A band of hunters might sneak upon herd of reindeer, bison or horses, pick out a likely victim, run it down and spear it to death. However, a lot might go wrong with this approach. A slight change of wind or a tiny sound would betray the hunters’ present, and the herd would run. To get really close to large animal, particularly one with horn, was especially dangerous; approaching a wounded one was doubly so. The Cro-Magnons’ chances of success and safety were increased by invention of spear thrower and the bow and arrow. Both enabled the hunters to launch their attack from a greater and safer distance.

""Stay away from butter and switch to 'heart healthy' margarine , is what they told us.    But is that really true?    Does switching from butter to margarine lower cholesterol and reduce your risk of a heart attack?    The answer is a resounding NO.    It turns out  margarine is one of the worst things you can eat for your arteries and heart .  (The margarine vs. butter myth ranks right up there with the lies youve been told about   cholesterol and eggs .)    Let me say this as clearly as I can & natural foods are always better than artificial foods. Always.    Butter is a natural healthy fat, made from cream.  Margarine is an artificial concoction of chemicals.     Butter tastes better and it's better for you.     I wont go into the details of how margarine is made, because it might be close to mealtime  and I dont want you to lose your appetite.    But here are two key points you need to remember:    Hydrogenation is used in the making of margarine and  you never want to eat hydrognenated foods . (Oh, and dont be  misled into thinking that partially hydrogenated isnt as bad for you.  All hydrogenation is bad for you.)   They use  second-rate oils of low quality  - which is bad enough, but to make matters  worse  these oils (often already rancid) are heated to high temperatures during the manufacturing  process.  Heated oils may be THE worst food you can put inside your body .          Lets not forget about the addition of some not-so-down-home-goodness like emulsifiers,  synthetic vitamins and artificial flavors and colors. How anyone can call this stuff healthy is beyond me.    Run on over to your refrigerator and toss any margarine tubs in the trash right now.     Don't mess around with that artery clogging and cancer causing junk.     While you dont want to go overboard with extremely high amounts of butter in your  diet, be sure to use butter over margarine. Your taste buds and your heart will both thank you for it.

Dishes include fish maw with crab meat soup, Peking duck, beef with curry sauce, salted fish fried rice, Buddha's delight, steamed sea bass, sauteed mixed vegetables. Comments:  The highlight was definitely the succulent Peking duck. A second plate was ordered to satisfy everyone's craving. The sauteed vegetables were popular as well (although I didn't touch it), and though swimming in oil it wasn't as heavy as it looked. I personally loved the beef and ate most of it, as well as the salted fish fried rice. Fish was ok, looked somewhat smaller than usual. The Buddha's Delight for some reason  still not fully explained (unless you count, ""the chef forgot"") did not contain tofu.  ""Service - fast and curt, when you could get their attention"". Overall Rating: 3 1/2 Oinks (out of 5). Overall, a satisfying, filling, reasonably priced meal to bring in the Year of the Dog.

Comments:  Service staff were formally dressed, gracious and well-trained, as can be expected from an establishment of this caliber. At times it seemed like there were too many of them, since we had numerous servers bringing the food or taking away the dishes from the last course. Perhaps that's the reason why the price of admission is steep. While not distinctive from the outside, the aroma of apples in the tunnel leading to the entrance of the restaurant provides a nice welcome into the uniquely designed interior. The walls and curved ceiling were painted dark red, and the effect was somewhat similar to dining in a fancy cave. My tasting menu selections were as follows (to the best of recollection): a) sashimi quality tuna  b) salmon with orange sauce c) slices of duck d) warm pineapple meringue I liked most of the dishes, especially the excellent medium rare duck. On the other hand, the salmon was so-so and the orange sauce overwhelmed the fish. The portions were a bit small, and were devoured almost instantaneously. Bouley also has a nice assortment of bread which are rolled out in a cart to your table - I tried the pistashio bread which was quite tasty.  Overall Rating: 4 Oinks (out of 5). Overall, a good upscale dining experience at a high price. Probably will come back on a date or special occasion.

At the back there is a lounge where a DJ plays live music starting at 10pm or so. It surprised several Hoboken natives in our group that the place serves dinner at all, and it came even more of surprise to the organizer that there were quite a number of diners at 730pm, since according to him, ""the place is usually dead"". Guess Restaurant Week helped in drawing a bit of a crowd. The fried calamari appetizer lacked flavor. The chicken francaise was well-executed but fairly standard. The waiters weren't well-trained either, as they kept asking which dish was ordered by whom as they were brought to the table.  Overall Rating: 3 Oinks (out of 5). Nice bar/lounge with yuppie crowd, but don't come for the food. Service could use some improvement.

Lobster was good but a bit dry and ultimately disappointing due to our great experience in the past, and I've certainly had much better lobster in Roatan (Honduras) recently. The lobster bisque was well=liked by all, and I enjoyed the tuna carpaccio as well. Dessert was disappointing - key lime pie didn't have the same sharp, tangy flavor but tasted more like custard. Overall Rating: 3 Oinks (out of 5). Nice atmosphere, but food not as good as before.

There are bars on two levels as well, and a big dining area. Chicken fingers were hot and crunchy. Blackened codfish was ok, the salsa topping was very tasty though. The side of beans reminded me of canned pork n beans from childhood. Maxine had cinnamon cheesecake for dessert, which didn't taste anything remotely like cheesecake. My bread pudding was good, even if I don't like raisins.  Overall Rating: 3 Oinks (out of 5). Nice after work hangout. Food is pretty standard.

Food lived up to its billing - tom kha gai soup was EXTREMELY spicy, causing me to break out in a sweat (in winter time!). Chicken curry was good too, portions were more than adequate. Everyone liked their dishes, one colleague said that the pad thai noodles were one of her best meals in a while. Soda is a bit expensive ($2) but they give you a huge glass (not a can) which comes in handy as you try to extinguish the flames inside your mouth. Place is a bit drab, but the great food and friendly service make up for it. Overall Rating: 4 Oinks (out of 5). Recommended for cheap filling lunch specials. Sure to become a favorite being close to work.

Now, for the hard part - making reservations.  In the past, one would need to look up the restaurant's phone number either in the Yellow Pages or by doing a search on Google, and then trying to get through to the reservations line. But if you're someone like me who dreads talking to strangers on the phone, or making repeated calls and getting a busy signal, now there exists a better alternative. A new website called  Open Table  offers the ability to make free, instant online reservations to over 4,000 participating restaurants all over the United States.  The way it works is simple. Just select a restaurant and date/time, and the number of diners, and availability (or lack thereof) is instantly displayed onscreen. If you decide to make a reservation, it will be instantly confirmed and stored in the restaurant's reservation system. Can't get easier than that. In the event that your plans change, cancelling or modifying your reservation is also a snap. Needless to say, I've found this site to be very handy in making Restaurant Week reservations!

Or maybe you want to impress a client and wanted to take him to a high end restaurant. So you're thinking, ""Wonder how much it would cost? And what entrees do they serve? Do they have vegetarian options?"". Well, if the restaurant of your choice happens to be in Manhattan, one of the most diverse dining capitals of the world, then you are in luck. One of the most invaluable resources I've discovered is MenuPages, which lists the menus of over 4500 (and counting) restaurants in that part of NYC. Moreover, you can search for restaurants by neighborhood and cuisine. For avid foodies, there is also an ""Advanced Search"" option which will surely hook you up with the right matches.  Probably the most useful feature is the ability to read customer ratings in four categories: food, service, value and atmosphere, as well as the essay reviews. Sometimes the conflicting reviews adds to the fun (and uncertainty), but in most cases it is worth the trouble to find out what feedback other diners have written.  To check out Menupages, click  here . Happy pigging out!

Sushi was fresh and delicious, and portions were generous. Spicy salmon roll a bit too spicy. Service was speedy and courteous. Highly recommended is the fried ice cream which comes in two flavors: green tea and red bean.   Overall Rating: 4 Oinks (out of 5). Recommended for delicious, reasonably priced sushi.

This two week festival is held on the same weeks as its NYC counterpart, on the weekdays of Jan 3 - Feb 3 (coincidence? I think not).  So, for those who get sick at the mere thought of schlepping into the city for great eats, you might want to check out the list of participating restaurants  here . With some of them literally a couple minutes walk from my doorstep, I'm simply salivating!!! Any reviews you wish to share will be welcomed, so go out there and pig out!

Yes, prices have gone up: $24.07 for lunch, $35 for dinner - not including beverages, taxes and tips. The good news is that it still affords us unwashed masses probably our only chance to sample the cuisine at these fine establishments without breaking the bank.  Click  here  for a full list of participating restaurants. I personally am looking forward to it, and trying to get friends together for some delicious meals. What's great is that reservations can be made online at  Open Table , though not for all participating restaurants. Among the restaurants I've tried in the past are Compass, Django, City Lobster, Inagiku, and Aureole. Most have been pretty good, some border on amazing. So take a look at the list, make those reservations, and let's pig out at the NYC Restaurant Week!

The inspiration for this blog comes from my brother's upcoming visit to NYC later this month. In preparation for his arrival, we have been exchanging emails to plan our culinary adventures at some of the city's top restaurants, and excitedly making the reservations. So while driving home today, I thought, ""I should create a blog about this"". A few moments later, it struck me: I should create a blog not only about the pigging out that will occur during his 4 days here, but about ALL of my interesting food experiences. And not only mine, but also my friends', some of whom eat out way more often than I do, surrounded as they are by numerous temptations.  So this blog will mostly chronicle my eating adventures, and thus contain restaurant reviews and recommendations. About good and bad experiences, in cheap hole-in-the-walls and upscale jacket-required restaurants alike. Mostly in NYC, some in Jersey. And some from wherever destination I travel to. Contributions from my friends stuffing themselves will be featured as well. So without further ado, grab your forks and let's eat!

Never before had I been to a Chinese bakery with such a wide array of filled  mochi  treats, other flavors including taro, strawberry, and chestnut. Although $3 seemed like a lot for one piece, it wasn't until I took the mochi out of its box that I realized it was about as dense as a dying sun and could feed at least two people for dessert. Unlike the Japanese mochi confection  daifuku , in which the mochi is closed all around the filling, the version from Yi Mei Fung consisted of a thin sheet of soft, chewy mochi wrapped around a ball of rich black sesame paste topped with a thin layer of yellow cake, resulting in a naked bottom.  Next time I'm in Flushing I plan on trying another flavor—in time, I will defeat them  all.

Unless your definition encompasses several slabs of pork bellylayered with skin, fat, meat, fat, meat, fat  ad Lipitor cooked to extreme unctuousness, dressed with pickled greens and ground peanuts then stuffed into a pillowy steamed bun that can barely contain its contents.    By now you've probably guessed that this porcine package comes from Flushing. This  guo bao  was lovingly prepared by the folks at Temple Snacks (aka Temple Snakes), in the  Roosevelt Food Court.  On my first few visits, I had no idea this bit of heaven on a bun existed. What can I say? When absolutely stuffed and facing a 42-item Chinese menu, I often resort to pointing at desserty looking items.

Zi bu yang rou hui mian  means something to the effect of ""delicious lamb braised soup noodle."" And thats also a statement that rings true. This handwritten sign is an ad for the  lamb noodle soup place  in the Golden Shopping Mall. When I saw it I almost made off with it since it was situated near some trash cans. Instead, I decided to just order a bowl.

Be Skeptical       Posted by  Ed Levine , November 18, 2008 at 11:30 AM         Photographs by Zach Brooks    I know SE:NY's  Zach Brooks  loves Chinese buffets, so I wondered why he'd never told me about the buffet  mentioned in the New York Times this weekend ,  East Buffet and Restaurant  in Flushing, which includes both Peking duck and suckling pig.  I had to investigate.  Why? Look at these prices:    Weekday lunch: $7.50  Weekday dinner: $14  Weekend lunch: $9  Weekend dinner: $15.50    Well, it turns out that even Chinese buffet lover Mr. Brooks had tried East and found it wanting. ""We tried it a couple of months ago and thought it was pretty mediocre.""  Clinton Street Baking Company  chef-owner Neil Kleinberg came to visit SE World HQ and said, ""Hey, did you see that cheap all-you-can-eat Peking duck place in the Times?  I spent 90 minutes driving out there yesterday, first to Brooklyn to pick up my son, then to Flushing, and man, were we disappointed. The Peking duck was so fatty.""    When I mentioned the idea of cheap Peking duck preparations, Serious Eats'  Kathy Chan  suggested the $1.75 Peking duck window in Flushing.  She even sent me a photo.

So when I heard that  The Gastronauts  would be hosting a 16-course dinner there with a heavy offal emphasis, I immediately RSVPd.     The club for adventurous eaters dines monthly on offal and other bizarre treats at restaurants all over the city. This started as six friends and now were bursting at the seams, co-founder Benjamin Pauker told me. That was certainly the case Tuesday night. Id never seen Xiao La Jiao so crowded. Nor had I ever seen so many non-Chinese in the house. What follows are the highlights of the dinner. It was rather hard to take notes with all that food flying around; think dysfunctional Thanksgiving dinner, but way spicier and way guttier. When I got home and looked in the mirror there was a faint red blotch of chili oil on the tip of my nose. Such is the frenzy that occurs when 40 or so like-minded eaters get together for a Sichuan blowout.

So I was glad to run across a brand-new food court located just down the street from the outstanding Sichuan spot  Little Pepper . The sign says  Roosevelt Food Court , but the Chinese ( Xin Lian He Mei Shi Cheng  ) means something like New United Beautiful Food City, or so I was told by  Jennifer 8. Lee .    But Chinese food wasnt what made me do a double-take outside Roosevelt Food Court on Sunday. It was a guy manning the grill behind a window plastered with pictures of food, and a sign reading KEBAB, ROASTED MEAT with an Arabic translation. I didnt know whether I was in Astoria or Flushing.

Now that is starting to change thanks to a new Chinese spot that sprang up seemingly overnight in a former check cashing store, next to a joint called  El Palacio de las Empanadas .  Gourmet Noodles and Delicacies , or  Huang Jin Jiao Feng Wei Xiao Chi  (which technically means Golden Corner Local Delicacies), isnt exactly new though. Its an outpost of a stall from the Golden Shopping Mall that serves cuisine from Wenzhou, a coastal Chinese city south of Shanghai. For whatever reason Id never explored the food in the Wenzhou stall. Perhaps its because the food court has so many other distractions to dazzle the taste buds. Both locations are run by a charming couple. The husband hails from Taiwan, and the wife, whos the chef, comes from Wenzhou. Photos of about 30 such delicacies line the wall, many of them cold dishes showcasing one form of offal or another. Right now most dont have names or descriptions, but the folks behind the counter will be glad to help you order. In the past week I managed to work my way through six of these dishes.

The sprawling grocery that just opened on Main Street in Flushing takes up more than three storefronts. Since I was unable to find someone to translate what the name means, I can only guess that it's Chinese for ""gargantuan supermarket with tons of fresh meat, seafood and vegetables."" That, or its a tribute to the  Chinese film producer . Either way theres quite the variety of seafood, including abalone. Ive never been able to overcome the price barrier of ordering this mollusk in a Chinese restaurant. Nor do I know how to prepare it, so I had put it out of my mind until I entered the snack aisle. There amidst a myriad of dried fruit and chicken biscuits was a box of one dozen abalone pastries, for a mere $3.49. Thats quite the price break compared to a restaurant. Japanese abalone has been known to fetch $108 an order at  Pings Seafood.  And that was eight years ago!

And special it was, consisting of a heaping mound of shaved ice—unfortunately on the crunchy, not fluffy side—topped with chopped ripe mango, sweet condensed milk, and a huge scoop of creamy mango ice cream.  My two friends and I polished it all off despite the decreasing space in our stomachs. I don't understand how frozen yogurt could become a huge craze while something as awesome and simple and refreshing as as shaved ice topped with ice cream and mango bits is hard to find.

Both are Wal-Mart sized megastores that sell all manner of dry goods, fruit, vegetables, meats, fish, condiments, and cooking equipment, and it even boasts a restaurant. The exterior of the sprawling Assi Plaza reads Oriental Food Cash & Carry. Last night I paid visit to a section of store that I like to call the  banchan bonanza.  There are literally dozens of types of the small side dishes you'll see served at every Korean restaurant, ranging from more common items to bizarre specialties. Which brings us to todays subject:  bahnggae jorim,  or  seasoned small crab.

It was a wondrous concoction of hand-pulled noodles along with chunks of meat and other goodies. Sadly the place closed last summer. Every now and then Id go back to see if it was reopening. Eventually I gave up and started focusing my eating on the food courts lower level. The other day I decided to give it another shot. As I approached the hairdresser I noticed a day-glow orange sign, in Chinese. In between the two lines of characters was the English translation: lamb noodle soup.

Nibbled at in the middle of a meal, between bites of marinated tripe, steamed sticky rice with  lup cheong , or taro, there is no ""right or wrong"" as to when you indulge in dessert. Which is perfect because I love dessert at the beginning, in the middle,  and  at the end of a meal.     Dim sum desserts are found in all forms at  Perfect Team Corporation .  They are fried and steam— some take the shape of bright jellies, some are made from rice noodles. My favorite are the baked  nai won baos . Served as a trio of warm, pillowy buns with crisp, egg topping (akin to pineapple buns), the topping all but crumbles away into sweet goodness on first bite. Inside, you'll find an eggy, sweet custard that, when served straight from the oven, oozes onto your tongue like molten lava. Try not to burn yourself. But the odds that you'll recall this warning while under the spell of hot  baos  are mighty slim!     Perfect Team Corporation    13659 37th Ave, 2nd Floor, Flushing NY 11354 (bn.

Are they excited about the recent fame? Trevor found out.                Photograph by Trevor Corson      As Serious Eats noted recently, food-minded adventurers are suddenly  descending   on   Flushing  in search of authentic Chinese, clutching a copy of the big July 30  New York Times  spread by Julia Moskin . They now know details about many of the hole-in-the-wall cooks in Flushing who specialize in mostly northern varieties of Chinese cuisine.     Having lived in northern China for a couple of years, where I survived on extremely tasty but occasionally sketchy food from hole-in-the-wall shops and street stands, I've long wished more Americans would warm to this wonderful stuff. But it was kinda funny to actually go to Flushing again now and do some eating with a couple of friends, after the highfalutin  Times  hoopla. Some spots are just a counter in a basement with a few folding chairs, now proudly posting copies of the  Times  spread on the wall with their eatery's mention circled in red ink.

Following  Ed's advice , we wanted to check out Curry & Curry's  New Delhi Spice  and Tony Mantuano's tapas bar,  Wine Bar Food .    There's a vast selection of fast food-ish options available in the ""Food Village"" including hot dogs, burgers, ice cream, pizza, deli sandwiches, and sushi. Last night was the opening round so crowds were light and lines, if any, seemed to move quickly.

If you're a serious eater, you know that most of the food is going to be overpriced and underdelicious.    Now if you insist on arriving empty-handed with an empty stomach, your two best bets are  Tony Mantuano's tapas bar,  new this year, and  Curry & Curry.  Mantuano will be cooking food from his book  Wine Bar Food,  which we  featured on Serious Eats  a few months ago. Mantuano is a fine cook (I have eaten his food many times), and I'm assuming they're giving him what he needs to prepare his tapas-style dishes well. But even if his food is up to snuff, it ain't going to be cheap.  The people running the concessions at the Open, like at every other sports stadium and event I can think of, definitely subscribe to what I call desert-island or we've-got-you-by-the-balls pricing.    A cheaper, real food alternative might be the aforementioned  Curry & Curry , a midtown mostly take-out spot that has somehow made it out to the Open as a sanctioned vendor. Serious Eats' Alaina Browne is going out to the Open tonight, so she will give us a full report.      But let's face it. If you want to eat some seriously delicious and cheap food, you've gotta eat before they take your ticket. There are a couple of solid choices within walking distance, and a number of others a subway stop or short drive away.

Unlike pork dumplings, spinach dumplings seem hard to find.  Lin's Dumpling House used to make one, but since the restaurant closed a few years ago I hadn't been able to find a vegetable dumpling I liked as much as theirs.       Available on the breakfast menu (served until 3 p.m.) at  No. 1 East Restaurant , the plump spinach dumplings were stuffed with finely chopped spinach in such a way that resulted in a moist, fluffy texture.  No pockets of air here, just lots of spinach goodness held within a thin, slightly chewy, homemade dumpling skin.  Compared to my other favorite kind of dumpling—fried pork dumplings—theses seemed downright light and healthy.       In addition to the spinach dumplings, No. 1 East Restaurant also had another of my favorite dishes that I hadn't eaten in years:  chive box .

Until very recently the only uncooked animal flesh Ive ever partaken in has been liver sashimi and Ethiopian  kitfo.  The liver was sort of slimy though not so bad when doctored up with salt, grated ginger and sesame oil. The chunks of beefy  kitfo  were very tasty, but their chewy texture left much to be desired; I took the remainder home and cooked it up in a cast iron skillet. Recently a friend raved about the Korean raw beef dish known as  yuk hwe,  and I was ashamed to admit that Id never tried it. I immediately atoned for this sin of omnivorous omission and made a solo trip to  San Soo Kap San  to expand my raw meat horizons.

Beef noodle soup  is my favorite Chinese noodle dish and, for $6.25, Happy Beef Noodle House delivers a bowl large enough for two.  This double serving of soup comes full of extra long, thick wheat noodles swimming in a star-anise flavored broth studded with thick chunks of stewed, chopstick-tender beef that almost melted in my mouth.  Each table comes with a seemingly neverending bowl of chopped pickled mustard greens to garnish your soup with.   I probably added more to my soup than what's proper, but I loved the added crunch and tang of the pickles.  Besides, it's not like they were going to stop me.

Due to journalistic pride I was also glad no mention was made of  Tian Jin Restaurant , particularly since it's right next to the White Bear, a spot where Julia Moskin ate. Ive poked my head into Tian Jin a few times to ogle trays of glistening  zhu ti , or pig's feet, but hadnt tried any until yesterday. This may have something to do with the fact that I'm not the world's biggest fan of pig's feet unless they're done up crispy.

Hed been telling me for weeks about the upcoming article. I also wanted to see how many ravenous  Times  readers had descended upon my second home. For all the ink it got the mall was pretty calm although I did notice a few wide-eyed non-Asians. I headed down the street to Liang Pis second location at the  Shi Hong Mall , where I was told that theyd been quite busy all day.     Sadly this was not the case when I returned last night, and found the door to Shi Hong open, but the space completely darkened. A table out front was covered with bags of fish balls and other delicacies plus a clipping of the newspaper article proudly displayed. The people manning the table were from Shi Hongs Fujianese stall. Apparently the landlord hadnt paid the electric bill. Lets hope the power gets turned back on soon. And Im not just saying that because I havent had a chance to try the Fujian soup with wontons that Moskin raved about.  41-42 Main Street, Flushing NY 11355 ( map )                           Post a Comment                                    Tags:   Chinese ,  Flushing ,  Queens ,  Shi Hong Mall                                                                                                  Recently in Talk: New York          What Happened to the Canton in NYC Chinatown?   1 comment   Fiamma Closed   3 comments   San Luigi (NYC) Relocation Rumors   0 comments   CSA in Manhattan?   2 comments   What Should I Eat at Momofuku's Bakery/Milk Bar?   7 comments   Great and Affordable in NYC?   17 comments    Read more in Talk: New York                           Recently on SE          Best Use of Obamaicon.me App: Food Porn   0 comments   Foodstuffs as Usernames on Twitter   0 comments   Controversy: Did Chicago Food Critic Pat Bruno Unmask Himself on 'Throwdown'?   0 comments   Vietnamese Surf and Turf at Chicago's Hai Yen   2 comments   Blogwatch: Clementine Cakes   0 comments                                     From SE: New York              Black Sesame Mochi from Yi Mei Fung Bakery in Flushing              "

The New  York Wine & Culinary Center (NYWCC) in Canandaigua (Finger   Lakes) opened in last year and has exceeded high expectations of  success.

Does your idea of cleaning involve disembowelment, dismemberment, and buckets of gore? If so, read on...   The helpful folks at  Learn2.Com  offer a step-by-step tutorial that's not afraid to get explicit. After washing your fish in cool water and removing the pectoral fins, you're instructed to:   1. Using the sharp knife, drive the blade point into the vent (small anal opening near the tail, where the body begins to widen). Cut right through the belly all the way to the gills.   2.Remove the guts from the cavity.   That's the bulk of the operation. Afterwards, remove the head, tail, and dorsal fin.

'In butter, it's the saturated fat content, and in margarine, it's trans fat.'                 By Elena Conis       December 8, 2008                                                If there's one indulgence that's practically unavoidable this time of year, it may well be the tray of holiday cookies. Adorned with sprinkles, spread with jam and frosting or dusted with powdered sugar, such cookies are a far cry from a healthful snack. Still, many cooks may nonetheless stand in their kitchens and wonder: Is it better to make them with margarine or butter?    Butter and margarine have a similar overall fat content -- and therefore a lot of calories, says Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. But the composition of the fats in butter and margarine differs significantly.                                                          ""You have to pick the lesser of two evils,"" Zeratsky says. ""In butter, it's the saturated fat content, and in margarine, it's trans fat.""    A tablespoon of butter contains more than three times the amount of cholesterol-raising saturated fat than the same amount of margarine -- 7 grams in butter compared with 2 grams in margarine.    In addition, butter and margarine contain mono- and polyunsaturated fats, but margarine contains them in far greater amounts: close to 9 grams per tablespoon compared with butter's 3.5 grams. These fats don't raise LDL cholesterol -- and some can help lower it, says Penny Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition at Penn State University in University Park, Penn.         Margarine's drawback is its trans-fat content. Margarines are made from blends of vegetable oils, such as corn, soybean, safflower or canola. Hydrogenation, a chemical process, replaces double chemical bonds in those oils  with single chemical bonds, making the liquid oils solid at room temperature. When that replacement process is incomplete, the result is a partially hydrogenated oil, also known as a trans fat. Trans fats are what make margarine solid instead of liquid -- but they've also been shown to be even worse for heart health than saturated fats. Not only do trans fats raise LDL cholesterol levels, they also lower HDL, or good, cholesterol.    For the last two years, manufacturers have been forced to list trans fats on food labels; as a result, many have reformulated their margarines (and other products) to lower or eliminate their trans fat content.    But the letter of the law is such that a food can claim to have no trans fat as long as it contains less than 0.5 gram of trans fat per serving. ""Even when the label says trans fat-free, it doesn't really mean that,"" says Barry Swanson, a food science professor at Washington State University in Pullman.    Food scientists, meanwhile, are still experimenting with alternatives to trans fats, which have been put into foods since the label law, says Richard Hartel, professor of food engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Many manufacturers are replacing trans fats with a blend of vegetable fats; one common substitute is palm oil, which was condemned decades ago for its large fraction -- 50% -- of saturated fat. Today, manufacturers often alter that fraction, but the final fraction of saturated fats in margarine containing palm oil may not be discernible from the label, Swanson says.    Butter, on the other hand,  is and always has been churned milk, a fact that makes it preferable to certain consumers, Zeratsky says. But that very fact means that butter, as an animal product, is loaded not only with saturated fat but also contains cholesterol -- something margarine doesn't contain.    Of course, when it comes to baking cookies, there are other factors on which to base the butter or margarine decision: aesthetics and flavor.    Butter contains an abundance of small-chain fatty acids, which readily break down during the baking process into a variety of molecules with a range of flavors -- lending baked goods a rich, buttery flavor, Swanson says. The flavor imparted by the long-chain molecules in vegetable oils, on the other hand, is far less complex.    Butter and margarine both tend to make thin, flat cookies. Though tub margarine often has more of a healthful profile than stick margarine -- it has more polyunsaturated fat and is less likely to contain trans fat -- cookies made with tub margarine will be very thin and oily due to tub margarine's high liquid content, says Eric Decker, chairman of the department of food science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.    Of course, sticklers for a cookie with light texture and volume know that the secret is neither butter nor margarine -- it's often shortening or lard, fat content be damned.    Hartel, author of ""Food Bites: The Science of the Foods We Eat,"" says he uses a combination of butter and shortening when baking cookies. ""Ultimately, that's a personal choice. The key is not to eat too many cookies.""    Conis is a freelance writer.     health@latimes.com                                                             Does LaserComb work?

Meat        and animal derivatives every day in your diet! What's unhealthier than this        uncontrolled cholesterol diet which could be oily, heavy and fatty. Before        you check the hour to sit for the next meal, the red meat for lunch may        not have digested at all. It's a cruel way to treat your obese body which        requires a lot of attention and medical help. In such cases what are your        chances for a healthy survival?        If it's not too late, just throw away your desire for meat and poultry        products until you lose some weight. Afterwards you could continue it in        moderation. In today's world people are on the look out for idols who they        can epitomize and it's good news that more and more celebrities have moved        on to a Vegan diet. Unknown are their intentions for such drastic steps        but it sure will help people one way or the other to think twice about a        healthy veggie diet. Why not these celebrities publicize their health trends!        Sure it's going to bring in few positive changes to many in the world.

Vegan Chocolate Feeds the Sweet Tooth                       By Anna Wilde   Being a vegan doesn't mean eating boring food. One        area that causes us more consternation than others is dessert. Most traditional        desserts include milk or cream. Whether it's cake or cookies, the recipes        usually call for dairy products.       That's why most vegans rejoice when they realize there are many vegan chocolate        options on the market. Not all chocolate contains milk. Dark chocolate is        vegan and is, in fact, much healthier than milk chocolate.        Dark chocolate contains antioxidants, much like red wine does. Researchers        in Europe have found that dark chocolate has heart-protective qualities,        whereas milk chocolate does not.        Researchers believe the proteins in milk may inhibit the antioxidant properties        of chocolate. This is terrific news for vegans. With dark chocolate they        are getting not only a dairy-free treat, but they are also treating their        bodies to a healthy dose of antioxidants.       The dairy industry would have us believe milk does a body good, but research        has shown over and over that dairy products are unhealthy. By choosing healthy        non-dairy chocolate and desserts, we are pulling our weight as conscious        consumers and letting the world know we won't be fooled into unhealthy food        choices.                                                                                                                                                       Anna Wilde is a freelance writer. She writes about  vegan chocolate  and other vegan issues in her blog.                                                    Veganism: Not As Intimidating As You Thought                         By Kirsten Hawkins   To some people, the phrase ""Vegan Cuisine""        sounds like an oxymoron. To others, it sounds like the road of a hardcore        food nutritionist. ""Scary,"" was the word used by my roommate when        I announced I was going to try to become a vegan. What most people don't        realize is that it's very possible, indeed even probable, for a creative        chef to make vegan food just as exciting and full of variety as any other        type of cuisine.       What is veganism, first of all? Strictly put, veganism is a diet which        contains no animal byproducts. Not only do vegans not eat meat, like vegetarians,        but they also do not consume any food created by animals. No milk, no eggs,        no dairy of any kind. No pasta derived from eggs. No gelatin. When you stop        to think, it is surprising how much of the typical American diet is animal-derived.       All of this, I admit, can sound rather scary to the typical meat and milk        lover, and certainly to the typical American who is surrounded by fast-food        hamburgers and bologna sandwiches from a young age. But veganism is not        as intimidating as it sounds. In fact, when the right choices in recipe        and menu are made, it can be extraordinarily flavorful and rewarding.       Think of it this way: Vegan cuisine can't rely on heavy, flavorful ingredients        like meat and dairy to get its flavor and substance. So what do they do        instead? They replace those ingredients in a way that makes you never even        miss them- with fresh vegetables, heady spices, wonderful texture combinations        and delicate wheat-based starches.       One of the most uniquely vegan foods on the market, and the one that tends        to scare the layperson the most, is tofu. Tofu is basically a soybean curd        with a sponge-like consistency and a bland taste that absorbs whatever flavors        are around it. Am I tempting you yet?       Wait. Let's try this. Imagine a dish of Italian stuffed shells, loaded        with tomato sauce and basil, garlic, and oregano. Now imagine that instead        of cheese, the shells were stuffed with a mixture of soft tofu, blended        with fresh spinach. The tofu absorbs the Italian spices and has a delicate,        creamy flavor all its own. Would you notice the absence of the cheese? Sure.        Would you miss it? Not likely.       There are many recipes unique to vegan cuisine that are truly surprising        in their variety and tastiness. Curry is one of the darlings of vegan cuisine,        and is available in all forms and flavors. Other wonderful vegan dishes        include several types of stir-fry, swimming in soy sauces and fresh vegetables;        salads overflowing with fresh beans and sweet oil dressings, and many spicy        and exciting side dishes and appetizers. Many people, for example, love        the wonderful garlicky zing of hummus and do not realize that it's a distinctly        vegan food.       Give vegan cuisine a try. Once you stop relying on meat and milk for your        flavor and fullness, you might just discover a whole new world out there,        where spices are abundant and soybean curd can be delicious.

Vitamins For Vegetarians                            By Simon Harris   There are a lot of vegetarians amongst us, some by circumstance        and some by choice. Those that are vegetarians by choice can be divided        into two general groups, those that do not eat meat, poultry or fish, but        do consume dairy products as - in theory - the animals are not harmed or        killed by the gathering of those products. Vegans, however, use no animal        products whatsoever.       There are many health benefits to a planned vegetarian diet, as opposed        to the unplanned vegetarian diets that result from poverty and a lack of        food availability. However, there are also some special precautions that        need to be taken to safeguard nutrition, as adequate amounts of some of        the most important nutrients can be more difficult to obtain. This is especially        true for those following the more restrictive vegan diet.       The body is a complex and delicate system, and the foundation of all of        its functioning is chemical and electrical actions, interactions and reactions.        The operation of this system rests firmly upon the balance of these chemicals.        The majority of the chemicals in these essential physical processes come        from the food that we eat, from the nutrients that come from its consumption.        Thus, nutrition has a deep influence of the health of the body and the quality        of its functioning.       Because the brain, like the body, functions on chemical reactions and electrical        impulses, the processes of cognition, emotion, and so on, are also affected        by nutrition. In fact, deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals can        result in mental illness and retardation, as well as cognitive dysfunction        and difficulties and emotional instability.       The Vitamin B complex offers a perfect example of how vegetarians must        pay special attention to their diets to ensure peak performance of body        and mind. The Vitamin B complex is involved with every major system in the        body and has a role in almost every important bodily process. It is essential        to mental health and functioning, and essential to life itself. However,        there are certain Vitamin B complex vitamins that need special attention        by vegetarians, as vegetarians do not consume the richest sources of these        vitamins.       The richest sources of Vitamin B2 are milk and organ meats. It is available        in enriched breads and cereals, but care must be taken to consume the right        amount daily. Niacin and Vitamin B6 are other B complex vitamins in which        the richest sources are meats and, again, are available in smaller concentrations        in enriched breads and cereals. Vitamin B12 is only found in animal products.        It is important to note that vitamin B12, in addition to being important        to the production of red blood cells, is essential for the normal growth        of children.       Nutritional supplements can serve to enhance the health benefits of the        vegetarian lifestyle. Indeed, they can serve to prevent the serious health        consequences that vitamin deficiency can cause. Nutrition is especially        essential for children, as their minds and bodies are growing and developing.        If you are vegetarian or vegan, you may want to consider the complete, safe        and reliable nutrition that dietary supplements can provide.

prepared meal.  Savor the flavor  of our nationally recognized wines or sip a tall, cool glass of Hudson Valley  Fresh milk.  And no visit to the county  is complete without bringing back a sample of your farm-fresh experience from  one of the many farms, farmers markets, specialty stores and galleries that dot  the local landscape.

Margarine                   I start this Chapter by asking you to compare     the diets of our ancestors with our own. Did your grandfather eat a lot of margarine?             Here is a comment on diet that fits well with the theme of this Book:           Something like four centuries ago man’s diet began to undergo a radical change. What he ate before that was European, Asian. Whole-grain barley, various proteins, various wheats and other foods were not necessarily abundant but they made up a radically different diet than modern man consumes.   With the discovery of the New World, for the first time there was an abundance of SUGAR. Up until then sugar came from a few scarce plants and beehives and was far too expensive for any broad general consumption. But the wealth of the West Indies was not really gold. It was the product of the sugar cane: BROWN AND WHITE SUGAR.   Also the Americas gave the world many new plants such as maize (the African’s ""mealy meal""), the potato and other carbohydrates and today a startlingly large amount of the European and African diet consists of plants first found in America. Almost all these foods are mainly carbohydrate, which is to say, low on protein.   Thus man’s diet changed. And the changes were in the direction of abundant sugar and carbohydrate and away from a high-protein diet.           And with this change, it could be said, there went man’s pep.   Sugar is a deceptive thing. It appears to give one energy. But it does so by bypassing the body’s production of its own sugar. Alcohol is also deceptive. It apparently bypasses the ability to make sugar and the result of eating it which is why it messes up the liver. In other words sugar in abundance bypassed the basic energy producing mechanisms of the body.   Straight sugar makes the stomach and digestive processes alkaline. This is the opposite to acid. Food needs acid to digest. Therefore, as just  one  part of all this scene, when one doesn’t eat protein and digest his food he winds up in a state of malnutrition -- a general breakdown of body functions due to lack of adequate nourishment.   Sugar, that is supposed ""to produce energy"" does so only at the expense of physical health for sugar does not build up a body, it only burns it up.   The result of a heavy intake of sugar and carbohydrates is to feel tired all the time -- no pep. A diet of candy bars and cokes may appear to put energy there but eventually no body is left to burn it!   Well, today they start little babies out on sugar and carbohydrate as an ""all right diet."" No protein. The result is these fat babies you see ballooning in their perambulators. They are starting life with two-and-a-half strikes on them. The rest of the third strike is added by cokes and candy bars. And there goes the old ballgame. You get a civilization that is tired, no endurance.       The degeneration can be reversed if one knocks off the cokes and candy bars and sugar in the coffee and tea and begins to concentrate on an intake of a good percentage of protein. After a few weeks or months, one starts to feel peppy. The old body has begun to build itself back.   If one is going to run a car, he has to feed it the right fuel and oil. If one is going to run a body it has to be fed the right food and that has to include protein.   We have seen [ aboard ]   a lot of diet fads. That’s what they were. ""Eat liquefied carrots and you will fly."" ""Chomp only vitamin X and you will soar."" Well, bad diets like that give dieting a bad name like ""crazy."" We’ve had food cranks around who only ate hazelnuts or Chinese herbs. Well, that’s a different subject entirely than what I’m talking about. I think those diets shouldn’t even be wished off on the birds.   All I’m talking about is eating your chow instead of living off candy bars, cokes and milk and sugared coffee.   By eating your hamburger and vegetables and leaving alone the candy bars and cokes, you will begin to build up a head of steam. It takes far longer for actual food to build up into energy than it does sugar.   Most of the bodies around got started off on a sugar-carbohydrate baby formula and got to believing that if something tasted sweet it was good. Well, cocaine probably tastes great too, but it won’t build up a body and the pep it imparts is very false indeed as it does so by ripping the body apart.   Man’s diet changed over the last four centuries. And he’s now got a lot of welfare and sick populations. And he sure pushes the stuff which got him into that condition -- sugar and carbohydrates.   America got even for being discovered and raped. She gave the world hordes of new carbohydrates and principally she gave the world abundant raw sugar. An interesting revenge.   L.

What Is Cholesterol?     What the dickens is this stuff called    cholesterol?   Well, if you think of it as soft butter floating in your arteries, you’ll have a rather traditional view.  But, that's not very accurate!   Cholesterol , the word, can also be defined as ""fat.""  The first part of the word, "" Chole "" means that something is related to the bile.  That last part comes from the Greek root "" stereos, "" and means ""solid"" or ""hard.""  When cholesterol was first identified, it was found in the gall-bladder (which uses bile) in the form of ""gall stones.""  These were hard, or solid particles made up of a fatty material combined with alcohol --  Cholesterol.       If you also understand that the great bulk of cholesterol in the body   was manufactured BY the body, not taken into the body as part of your diet, you’ll   have a more accurate understanding of this stuff.           The liver is the primary source of manufacture of  cholesterol .   Note the drawing to the side. The liver is actually larger than the stomach and is an   extremely important organ in the body. For instance, the liver manufactures cholesterol,   mixes it with some other substances which turn it into something called  bile . Bile   is the substance which is secreted by the liver, some of it is stored in the      gallbladder ,   and eventually pours into the small intestine where it is used to help digest fats that   you have eaten.     There have been more lies told by medicine and the media about cholesterol, probably, than any other health subject.   You’ve generally heard that cholesterol is responsible for the cause of heart disease and that your diet, too rich in fats, is responsible for high levels of cholesterol in your blood, and therefore responsible for heart disease.   These are such important lies that I want to take some time and space here to set the matter right.     Butter     First, let me give you a quick idea about  life before margarine .   Many decades ago, when your great-grandfather lived, there were two common forms of fat in the diet. The rich ate butter, the poor ate lard. Both are natural products from animals.            Lard is taken from dead pigs.   Butter is taken from live cows.   You can choose your animal.   Let’s look a bit at butter.   You are a farmer, in the 1800’s and you have a couple of cows. You milk them early in the morning, and again at night. You turn them out to eat grass during the day, and put them in the barn at night.         The milk you get from the cow could be squirted from the teat of the cow directly into a metal pail. You might want to keep the flies out of the milk. You put it into a cool place for a while and when you then take a look at it you’d find that the ""milk"" has separated into two different parts.       There is a thick part of the milk, floating on the top. We call that   cream.     Then, there is a thin part of the milk, below the cream. We call that   the skimmed milk.     Let’s simply pour off (or ""skim off"") the cream from the   top, trying hard to not get any of the thinner milk below. We pour this into another pail.   Now, we have a pail with a quart or two of cream.     Whether that cream is ""rich"" or not so rich depends on the   type of cow and the type of food being eaten by the cow. But, most of the time that cream   in the pail can be used to make butter.     How?                         Well, you take a stick, place it in the pail, and stir it around,   rapidly. In fact, you might say that you beat the stick through the cream, fast. This fast   beating has a special name -- called  churn  or  churning .     You do that for a while and guess what?     The stuff in the pail separates into two different substances. There   are gobs of butter now forming, probably sticking to the stick. And, there is a thin   liquid -- the left-over stuff.  The picture on the right is an actual   churn -- put the cream in the jar, screw on the top and turn the handle --   very fancy compared to a stick in a pail.  Both work!                                                                       Butter Churn                       The butter in that pail is ready to eat. You don’t   have to process it any   further at all. You might use a large spoon to scoop up the stuff and place it on some wax   paper in little butter patties. You could then put that butter, on the wax paper, into the   ice box so that the butter would get hard. You could then take those patties of butter and   wrap them in pretty foil paper and sell them to restaurants as butter patties.     You still can find butter patties in most restaurants.     You can make butter this way. Or, you can buy an expensive automatic   milking machine, and run the milk through pipes to a gadget that removes any dirt that got   into the milk, and then pipes the cream to a fancy churn where the cream is turned into   butter. Then, if you invest enough in machines, the butter will be automatically molded   into patties, wrapped, and packed into cartons, placed in the cooler awaiting shipment to   the restaurants.     Now, let’s take a look at this stuff. Back in the 1800’s, you’d mostly get butter by going to a farmer and maybe taking your own butter tub. He’d fill the tub with butter and you’d pay him.   The butter industry was a big one, but it was certainly not controlled by a small number of producers whereas the margarine industry is controlled by only a few very large companies.   As prosperity and living standards both improved, we started getting butter being produced in many mechanized dairy farms, and shipped in refrigerated trucks to supermarkets where we could buy it in one pound cartons.   That was about the scene in the 1930’s. Then, during World War II, butter, for some reason, seemed to be in short supply and you had to have a ration coupon to buy the stuff.                                                     Butter       Choosing       Margarine                   After that war, butter was in good supply and people took for granted that they could buy as much butter as they wanted in the stores. Back in 1947, after the war, butter was plentiful, but sold for $1.00 per pound when margarine was only $ .17 per pound.                    At about the same time, there were the cotton growers who had good use for the cotton, but no use at all for all those devilish seeds. They realized that the seeds contained oil, but there was no market for the stuff.   At the same time, there were other farmers growing crops like soy beans. Soy beans, in particular, would produce very large crops and the farmers thought that something valuable must be in those beans.     Margarine     Lard would be far more healthy for you to eat than margarine. If, after reading this next section you still eat margarine, then you should ask for a refund on the purchase price of this Book!   What was in there was OIL. Some smart guy got the idea that if you could get the oil out of these seeds and beans you could sell the oil and compete with the olive oil market, maybe even the butter market. Some chemists got involved -- I won’t try to give you the whole history of the creation of  oleo margarine  -- and before you know it this margarine stuff could be produced out of the oil squeezed from cottonseeds, soy beans or many other vegetable sources, even eventually from coconuts -- a product in great supply in cheap-labor countries and not all that much used as a food.   All you had to do was squeeze these seeds or beans and you got the oil out. You had to then mix a bunch of chemicals in with the oil, but eventually you got margarine.   Margarine was invented by a Frenchman in 1869.   When you got down to the paper and pencil work, it looked like the amount of money tied up in a pound of butter (cows, grass, milking, churning, etc.) was vastly higher than what it would cost to produce an equivalent amount of fat from cottonseed oil -- even when that cottonseed oil was converted into the solid stuff --  oleo margarine .   Butter was selling for $1.00 per pound and the cottonseed people saw how they could make a pound of margarine to sell for about $ 0.17. There was obviously a big market here if the butter eaters could be convinced to eat the left-overs from the cotton plantations.   There were problems, of course.   The butter often turned out to be a pretty yellow color. Not always! The dairy farmers had gotten together, even got laws passed, so that they could all agree on a standard yellow color for good butter. Then, when some poor cow produced milk which made butter that was too pale, the farmers just added yellow dye to make the butter yellow.   Now, when the margarine makers got done, their product was a nice natural color -- about the color of lard.   This wouldn’t do!   Butter was an upscale product.   The plot thickens -- just like butter in the churn.   The margarine people had an ugly white product that looked like lard and it was hard to sell it against butter. The butter people, seeing the face of their enemy, got laws passed to prevent the margarine people from putting any of that artificial yellow dye into THEIR product (even though the farmers were putting it into the pale butter).   So, the margarine makers fought back -- selling the ugly white stuff in one pound chunks, wrapped to include a little yellow pill. The instructions said to take the white ugly stuff, put it in a bowl, let it soften a bit at room temperature, and then mix in the yellow powder in the little pill. If you mixed it right, the white stuff turned into pretty yellow -- looking quite a bit like butter.   But what a bother!   If you are old enough, you can remember the days back in the 1940’s and 1950’s when margarine was sold with the little yellow dye tablets!   Now the story gets sinister. The oil people tended to be rich and big. The butter people tended to be small and not so rich. The oil people also were willing to corrupt the governmental processes. The dairy farmers were inherently naive -- not scheming enough.   Here’s the story about margarine:   You start with some cottonseeds -- put them in a gadget which will apply physical pressure on the seeds and allow the oil to be pressed out.   You apply the pressure.    You squeeze the seeds!   Hurrah! You get some oil out of the seeds.   But, when you calculate you realize that you are getting only about 5% of the oil that is in the seed. The rest is still in the seed.   You do it again, with new seeds. This time you press harder. You put lots of pressure. This time you notice that the oil coming out is hot. You’ve put so much pressure on the seeds that you have heated them up!   But, you still only got less than 10% of the oil that is actually in the seed.   Incidentally, the first try, squeeze the seeds, but no heat -- that is called cold pressed oil in the stores. It’s much more healthy for you than the stuff that has been heated. Heated oil is bad stuff. I’ll comment on that later.   Now, if you are a cotton plantation owner, with all those cottonseeds going to waste, or if you are a scheming chemist, you figure that you can get ALL that oil out of the seeds.   So, you put the seeds in a gadget that will not only squeeze them hard, but deliberately raise the temperature to 350 o  F. Then, to really get that oil out you pour in some solvent.           Legally you could use gasoline because the government approves a standard for the types of solvent that can be used in this process. As long as you get most of the solvent out of the oil when you finish, you can use gasoline, hexane, benzene, ethyl ether, carbon disulfide, carton tetrachloride or methylene chloride. Isn’t that comforting! As long as there is not more than 100 parts per million of gasoline left in the oil, it’s legal.   So, you pour in the solvent -- turn on the heat and the pressure and you finally get about 95% of the oil out of the cottonseeds.   When you understand this process you will realize that the solvent, at this point, is worth more per gallon than the oil! So, in order to make this process economical we have to have a way to get the solvent out of the oil.           That simply takes more heat. They heat the mess up to an even higher temperature. The solvent is ""boiled off"" and caught to be used again. It’s good to think that your margarine is made with re-cycled solvent!   They are done, almost. They have cottonseed oil with most of the gasoline removed.   If you were to look at this stuff you would vomit! It is an evil dark color and smells terrible. So, they have chemical deodorants and bleaches they now throw in.   Hurrah! They now have a nice colorless liquid oil that has no smell. They now add in some color because customers don’t believe in colorless vegetable oil.   Well, there is a certain limited market for liquid oil, made as I’ve described it above. But, that is not butter. How, do you suppose, do they fiddle with that oil to make it solid, and color it so it looks like butter, and add more chemicals to make it taste like butter? It would also rot if preservatives were not added. But, fear not, the FDA is at the guard!   The general answer is more chemicals. For instance, lye is used as part of the process.   More specifically, the factory bubbles up some hydrogen through the oil. Some of the hydrogen sticks to the oil particles and makes those oil particles stick to one another. Miracle! The oil becomes solid. That’s why they call that stuff  hydrogenated .   Now, you may have guessed, it really isn’t food by any reasonable definition. But, per the government, it is OK to put in the supermarket, next to the real stuff. It’s safe on the unrefrigerated shelf because, you see, it won’t melt! It won’t melt in your stomach either! They put it in the refrigerated case just to make you think it’s like butter!   Now that you have all that straight, I’ll bet a nickel that you are not so likely to eat margarine any more. When you hear the rest of the cholesterol story, you may feel that your government has betrayed you to the special interests of the cotton growers and chemical factories.   Congratulations on waking up!   Here’s a letter I received from Blaine and Sabra G of Shelby, North Carolina who quit eating margarine after reading the First Edition of this Book, and had other good reports besides:                     Dear Karl,       My wife (Sabra) and I have been on the XX   formula since September 28, 1994. So as of this date (February 10, 1995) we have had four   months of these supplements. It wasn’t long before our breathing and circulation was   much better, and our cholesterol was lower.     We changed from margarine to butter and began to avoid all processed   foods and homogenized milk.       We especially took your advice about drinking lots of water without the   chlorine. We are now walking 3 miles a day and are feeling great even at the age of 76.       Now our colons are regular and all the other little aches and pains   have gone away.     About ten years ago my legs and feet began to feel like pin cushions   and finally last year got to the point where I could hardly stand shoes on my feet. After   just four months of this oral chelation therapy my feet are almost back to normal. Now   I’m sorry I sold my golf clubs!     We have good friends that we try to convince them that they should try   this too. But, the doctors have them so indoctrinated that theirs is the only treatment   that anyone should use, its about useless to tell them about it. When they begin to suffer   maybe they’ll listen.     Your book,  Life Flow One, The Solution For Heart Disease , should   be on the best seller list. Our copy is at our side all the time for reference and for   reading. We shall look forward to your new book which will be equally welcome at our home.     Your friends,     Blaine & Sabra               Back in the 1940’s margarine was a very unattractive food product. By 1950 the stuff was being cooked up, in the sense of a master plan, in the chemical laboratories. The butter people, however, still had the big advantage.      The margarine was that ugly white color. The margarine makers won that battle, got the tax on margarine removed and got the color restrictions removed.   By 1957 margarine consumption was larger than butter consumption.   Now, of course, your reality is that margarine promotes the health of your heart while butter is bad -- and, of course, the margarine is a pretty yellow color.   You probably also have the reality that bread, pasta and fruits are excellent sources of nutrition. They are, of course, far superior to sugar and coke. BUT, man, today, is not getting enough protein in his diet, and is getting too much carbohydrates.   The extra fat you might take into your body, in cream and animal fat will do you far less harm than the extra carbohydrates you take in, in the form of processed foods, starches, sugar and junk foods.           Butter is far better for you than margarine, but this concept extends far beyond butter. Man needs a change in his diet -- towards more proteins and less carbohydrates.   Well-done research shows that consumption of margarine increases the chances of cancer. Certainly there is no evidence that butter or animal fat has anything to do with causing heart disease.   How did this all come about?                     There were certain people who I identify in this Book, and who I shall call the original master planners!   Read on to find out who they were!                                                 Footnotes                                                     L.

Butter Churns   have played a big part in the early rural family homes. From the turn of the century and until after WW II. By 1950, the making of butter was taken over by the large Creameries Company . The advent of electricity in rural America (REA) soon was instrumental in the demise of home made butter.                          Navigation Menu For The Book      Life Flow One               Home Page      Karl Loren's Book       Home Page Of The Data Section -- With Links To Each Separate Article        Shopping Cart      To Purchase Oral Chelation Products      From Karl Loren               Home Page Of The Karl Loren Writings Section -- With Links To Each Separate Item       Search The Entire Web Site      Using The Professional Google Search Engine Especially Indexed For This Web Site       Home Page Of The Oral Chelation Web Site               Section One      Who Will Die?

Its really important to keep these cards in a safe place where you can find them when you need them.  You Also want to make sure you use them before the expiration date. So grab those cards, make a list of each card, domination and expiration date.  Next, figure out the best time to use them.  For instance do you have a special occasion coming up?  Use that $50  spa gift .  How about a birthday party?  Use the  bookstore  gift certificate to purchase a that new  bestseller .  So get creative with those cards but most importantly use them!  The person who gave you the gift certificate had good intentions and they want you to enjoy their gift!

It's fun to get that fresh copy of all the latest and the greatest your favorite mag offers each month.  But what happens after your sign up?  You sign up in January for a one year subscription, six months later you start receiving renewal invoices with a 20% discount for 2 years!  What do you do?  Do you keep the invoice?  Throw it away?  But what a deal...or not?  Wait didn't you just pay for the subscription?  Is it already expired?  Who knows? What about that other mystery invoice from another magazine you may or may not have received in the past?  Did you just get another invoice from them as well?  Sometimes it can be hard to figure out which magazine you paid for, which subscriptions are running out and which ones you even want to renew and when? Organizing tip - Renew all subscriptions for magazines, memberships and clubs at the same time each year.  Record this information in your calender and the date it will run out.   Set a reminder 2 months before the expiration date so you have time to renew.  To make it even easier on yourself list your account number and phone number to call.

Let go of any clothes that have stains, rips or are beyond repair.    Let go of clothes that don't reflect your current lifestyle. If you used to work in a corporate office and now work from home, think about getting rid of the suits. If you can't remember the last time you wore an item...time to let it go.     And finally get rid of the clothes that  don't fit, or don't look good on you. You really need to love they way your clothes make you look and feel    Storage Tip:  Keep the sentimental clothes like your collage sweater outside your immediate closet space.      Tip:  You should never feel bad about getting rid of clothes because you are really helping out people  by donating to your favorite charity you may also get a tax deduction. You should plan on going through your closets every season.

Some are suggestions like ""freshest by"", ""best if used by"" or ""best before"". These terms are generally  guidelines  for getting the most out of the product. A box of crackers might have a ""best if used by"" date that would indicate the crackers might not be as crisp if eaten after the date, however they would still be edible. However an ""expiration date"" is a completely different kind of date that tells us not to use the product after such a date. Expiration dates are typically reserved for perishables that may not be safe for consumption after the date. In general most people know about expiration dates for perishable items such as raw meats and dairy products. But many other items found in the grocery store also carry expiration dates and have some kind of shelf life that we should be aware of. For instance batteries can lose their effectiveness after sitting too long or if not stored properly. The same goes for sunblock and many medications. For this reason it is important to routinely go through cabinets, cupboards, drawers and pantries to check expiration dates. It won't do you any good to discover your cough medicine expired 6 months ago at 11pm when you are desperately trying to get some sleep. It is better to throw away expired items before you need them and give yourself plenty of time to go to the store and replenish your supplies. Some general tips concerning expiration dates: When in doubt, throw it out. Medications can lose effectiveness after the expiration date. To help manage the medicine cabinet, write expiration dates on the bottle cap. Writing the date will make it more  noticeable  when glancing through the cabinet. Although the ramifications are not as severe, the same applies to herbs. After time they become stale or lose potency. Stale herbs can turn a great recipe into a mediocre one, so try the same technique and write the expiration dates on the containers. Then before going to the store, a quick glance should uncover any items that need to be replaced. Your grocery store manager understands the importance of making sure that the oldest items sell before the newest items. That is why they rotate stock and are constantly bringing items from the back of the shelf to the front. You should do the same. When putting away canned goods bring the items from the back forward and place the newest items towards the back. This will help prevent the back of your cupboards from being a storage locker for 5 year old soup cans. Be careful of ""sell by"" dates. The grocery store often stores foods at lower temperatures than our home  refrigerators . So items may last a little longer in the store than at home. For instance most butchers and  grocers  store meat at 30 degrees, while the majority of home refrigerators are 40 degrees, making the shelf life of meat significantly less at home than at the grocery store. Meat should only be stored for 2 days in a home refrigerator.

First, organizing is NOT about being perfect or neat. Nobody ever says I just love Jane or Joe  he or she is soooo organized. But they do love that they can depend on Jane. They like that Joe does what he says he is going to do. They like that Jane arrives on time and doesnt leave you standing on the corner waiting  in the rain. They love that they remember birthdays or your pets name. They love the result of being organized. So organizing is not a goal it's a tactic - a tool to help you achieve your goals.

But getting organized is about developing  new habits  and making it a part of your daily routine. Create a  visual picture  of where you want to be by creating a collage with pictures and inspiring words. Incorporate your organization plan into it and then hang it somewhere you can see it everyday top inspire you  kitchen, office, near the medicine chest. The activity of creating your inspiration guidebook will reinforce your plan in additions to helping you maintain your daily routine.

Here is the 2nd step to help make organization a part of your daily routine. #2 Make a plan. Lets say youd like to have more balance in your life and spend more time with your children. So start brainstorming ideas on how you can achieve that. Look for ways to trim wasted time or do things more efficiently. Start with Larger concepts, such as stop wasting time looking for misplaced items, then drill down with specific steps to help achieve that goal. For example, you could determine a specific place to put away your  keys  as soon as you walk in the door and resolve to do it each and every day. Keep going until you have a plan.

Here's how to make it stick.   Every year, getting organized makes the top ten list of New Year's resolutions. If so many of us want to get organized, why is it so hard to achieve? Here's the 1st step to help make organization a part of your  daily routine.   #1 Get Perspective Many people find it hard to stay organized because they don't have the right perspective. Getting organized shouldn't be a goal unto itself. Organization is a tool to achieve life's bigger goals. For example, someone might say they want to get organized but what they're really looking for is more  balance in their life . By being organized, they wouldn't waste so much time looking for misplaced items, such as keys and glasses. They wouldn't get stressed by running late so often. The goal is much more than simply having a neat house. It's about quality of life. So before you start trying to get organized, ask yourself, what are the big picture goals you want to achieve? Do you want more balance in your work and personal life, to be more productive at work, or even  get out of debt ? Those are worthy goals. Your plan for getting organized should be centered on achieving a bigger goal.

She did a quick check before turning it on and was surprised to find something....a leftover from  Christmas ! I was in charge of bringing the bread and desserts. Desserts were a huge hit. The bread¬ so much. I mixed the bread at home and brought it to my sisters house to continue rising then bake. The bread did not rise long enough so it didn't bake correctly. So we kept putting it back in the oven to bake 10-15 minutes and another 10-15 minutes and another until we gave up. Everyone had already finished eating dinner and here we were still trying to bake 2 loaves of bread. Needless to say the bread did not turn out and never got thrown away. So, I've added the bread fiasco to my holiday party notes and hopefully it will turn out better next year.

I wanted to add that you should also keep notes on any food you send out such as cookies, cakes or even side dishes for parties with family and friends. Did everyone eat what you prepared? Was their too much food and your food was never touched? Was it the right food for the party? Some parties are great for  finger foods  where you dont need to sit down and use a knife and fork. So if youve prepared a dish and there are no places for guests to sit and eat, its going to be difficult. Or if your dish needs special attention like  staying hot  in a crock pot or keeping cold its just not going to work out if your host is not prepared. So, take a few mental notes at the party and write down those notes as soon as you remember. Don't get stuck next year spending too much time and energy on food that gets wasted.

It's really easy to send an  ecard  to your techy friends and family but it's nice to see those colorful envelopes in the mail box with a handwritten address rather than the typical junk mail or bills. Their are cards for every occasion. We buy these cards with good intentions on sending but sometimes we forget to send the card! So now you have all these extra cards laying around that say ""Happy 21st Birthday"" or ""Fifty and Fabulous"". Now what are your going to do? Store them in your valuable space? Throw them away? You may have just wasted some valuable time traveling, shopping and spending money and the recipient may not ever see those good wishes. My advice for dealing with the birthday cards is to have a  personalize birthday card  that you can send to everyone. This would say Happy Birthday on the front and whatever you want to say inside and list who it is from. This way everyone is getting the same card this year and you don't have to run out every time someone has a birthday. If you want to do this each year make a list of everyone you would like to send a card to and just order a small amount. Bonus Tips Make a folder for each month of birthdays and on a rainy day address all the cards, place a stamp on the envelope, add the send date on your  birthday calender  or use the  birthday alarm  as a reminder. Now you are sent for the entire year! Good Luck!

Then you already know the getting your home ready for guests, preparing food and trying to time it all just right so you can enjoy the evening with your guests can be hard work. This year we hosted dinner for eight and my goal was to have everything ready before my guests arrived. Everything went well except for a few things I would have had done differently. Im making my list for next years party. Here are a few tips: 1. Keep your  shopping receipts  from the grocery store and indicate which items you purchased for the dinner or party. 2. Make notes on quantities used in recipes, appetizer treys etc. My shopping receipt shows the size so its easy for me to note used 4 oz from the 16oz package of mushrooms. Now I have the notes for next year and I will buy a smaller amount. I hate wasting food and with leftovers and during the holidays your refrigerator gets packed. 3. Make notes if you didnt purchase enough of one item so you dont have to run out to the store in the middle of your food preparations. 4. Indicate items that were a big hit so you are sure to purchase again next year. 5. Indicate items that nobody ate, drank or you overbought. This year I bought egg nog and forgot to put out so it sat in the fridge. One guest likes a particular cola so I made sure I had this on hand. This year he chose a different drink so I had an extra 2 liter. Next year I will buy 1 can of cola. We had too many crackers and they didnt fit on the cheese trey. They were never opened so they too will not make the list next year. 6. I store my lists, and receipts in an envelope and pack with my holiday decorations.

I waited until this morning to do a count on  Around the world in a bowl of rice  entries to make sure I didn't overlook any US West Coast late comers, and the final count is now at 49.(No! It's now 52!!)  Well, 49 bowls and 3 cups of rice, to be exact.  These entries take us through a fascinating cultural and historical landscape of our world, from dishes rooted in ancient ways of living, to those that exemplify to quilted interconnectedness of our new world.  Some of these dishes simply remind us of home, while others take us through a curious journey through the cultures that are foreign to us.  I've had such fun putting this list together, now, please join me in this mesmerizing journey around the world in a rice bowl.                       Ancient grain, ancient world  Jeremy in New York drew from his family's Iraqi heritage to bring us  T'beet Rice .  A traditional Sabbath lunch of Iraqi Jews, this rice dish is a fusion of the middle-eastern staple of rice and the Jewish religious restriction of not extinguishing a fire on Sabbath, resulting in gorgeously red and delicious rice.  My friend Vanessa sent me a recipe for  Kitchri , a compromise between Jewish dietary laws forbidding the combination of meat and milk, and the common middle-eastern practice of combining yogurt and/or butter with meat dishes. The resulting dish, which has no meat, is a lavish blend of fantastic dairy products, not only cooked in butter but melted butter was added at the table; yogurt was used as a sauce and as an accompanying drink; and served with fried slices of cheese.  From the Carolina Lowcountry, we have not one but two versions of Hoppin' John, a rice and peas dish which came to the American South via the Caribbean islands.   The first  came from Kate from the Accidental Hedonist, who flavors her version with ham hock.   The second one , from Shaun in her Backyard Grub, uses crabmeat instead of the ham hock.     Our home is where the rice is  Few things make us feel more at home, or melancholy for one, than the food from our childhood.    Theresa of Crumbs, made us a  Homesick Chicken Rice  in Switzerland to remind herself of her home in Singapore.    Alberto of Il Forno, an Italian in Germany, and the brain behind the first IMBB? gave us a favorite from his childhood,  Arancine al Sugo , stuffed rice balls, covered in bread crumbs and deep fried.   Wena in Malaysia again consulted her adorable granny and came up with  fried rice with aw kana , which reminded me of a similar dish from my own childhood in Thailand.  Claudine, of Memory and Desire from California, made  her mom's fried rice , a delicious blend of her Chinese-Filipino heritage.  Umami gave us  Nasi Ulam  (Malay for Herbed Rice), a rice dish that contrasts the freshness of herbs with the pungency and strong flavours of ingredients like belacan (dried fermented shrimp paste), dried salted fish and dried shrimps.  Malaysia in a rice bowl.   Buzzwood of Onokinegrindz in Hawaii, gave us  gomoku takikomi gohan , rice with five ingredients to celebrate his Japanese ancestry.  Chez Pim's number one (and only?) faithful reader, Sher, sent me her  Shrimp Creole , from the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  Mikiko of I was just really hungry, showed us her Japanese roots in her  Spring fried rice with chive blossoms .   I made myself feel at home by making a dish of rice with embarking relish,  Khao Nam-prik Long Ruea , a dish from my childhood in Bangok.  This spicy and pungent dish is served with crispy fish, caramelized pork, salted duck eggs and vegetables.  Ninds, of Marmaladechainsaw, invited us to her homey breakfast of  Nasi Goreng , an Indonesian classic.     The world in a bowl of rice  These rice dishes exemplify the blending of many cultural roots and ethnic origins, and our fascination with exotic cuisines, our world in a simple bowl of rice.  Rene of shiokadelicious in Singapore sent her  Nasi Briyani , a dish that was Indian by birth, but has been warmly welcomed and adopted by South East Asians. An integral part of the Singaporean and Malaysian epicurean landscape, it is popular amongst not only the local Indians but also the Chinese and Malays as well.   From Maryland, Lynda at Table Scraps,  Chicken Curry with Saffron Rice , an Indian recipe she found on the internet.  Our world, au courant, in a bowl.    Marsha of Hot Water Bath made us her  Global Chicken and Rice , a tribute to her mixed heritage and her ancestors who hailed from all over the globe.  Carlo The Flying Italian of La Cena sent his  insalata di riso , a simple rice salad, comprising ingredients from all over the world, greek cheese, italian olives, english pickled onions, thai sweet basil, spanish tinned tuna, sicilian capers plus boiled eggs, fresh peppers, fresh courgettes, more cheese and so on (and on and on).  From Zurich, Roger of Itadakimasu, gave us  Rice, Salmon Teriyaki, Eggplant with Red Miso , showing us his fascination with all things Japanese, in a rice set dish.  He also provided an instruction on how to cook rice without a rice cooker, something of which I am entirely incapable.  Another one with a Japanese slant, Redbeard at Life in Flow left us some  sushi .  Frankly I'm not entirely sure what to make of sushi from a Marine Biologist.  How about you?  My friend Isabelle in Paris (I'm jealous just saying that, Isabelle in Paris, aren't you?), sent her version of  Sofyani Biryani , based on recipes from a cookbook she brought back from her enchanting trip to India.  Matt of Kerner.net sent  Paella , he actually called his friend's mom all the way over in Spain, and at terribly late hour, for advice on this recipe.  Meg, who is over in Paris, apparently also a fan of Paella, contributed her own  Chinese French Paella .  Mipmup made us some  chicken and rice and hot salsa .  Elise of Elise's Simply Recipes brought us a  curry and rice salad , her very own ingenious way of using up leftover rice from her fancy Japanese rice cooker.    Risotti of our hearts  Originally from Italy, Risotto is one of the most popular rice dishes in the world.  It also proved quite popular with our food bloggers.    Matt of Bourrez votre visage sent  Wild King Salmon with Red Beet Horseradish Risotto & Asparagus with morels.   Pascale of C'est moi qui l'ai fait in Paris sent us her family's favorite  Prawns and Peas Risotto .  What a gorgeous picture!  A  California Risotto , by Derrick, a Californian rendition of Risotto Barolo, a Piedmont classic.  Irene of Cuisine Capers, reached into her Sicilian heritage to bring us  Risotto ala Caprese .  This IMBB edition has inspired a birth of at least one food blog, Cook Sister, by Jeanne, a South African woman living in London.  She made us  South African Boerewors and Butternut Risotto .  Janet in Chicago gave us her  Shrimp with Vegetable Risotto .  Elke from Elkit in Wonderland, a German living in California brought us Spring by giving us her  risotto con piselli e limon  (Risotto with Peas and Lemon)   And to dispel the myth that risotto is difficult to make, Christine at Delish, all the way in New Zealand, sent her  Cheater's Easy Risotto .  Also, Owen of Tomatilla, who, even during his not so good times, kept up his spirit and joined in the fun by making us his  Asparagus Lemon Risotto .  Here he showed us that fusion is far more than about ingredients, as his version is a blend two cultures, food from italy and an common Asian cooking implement.    Rice, by any other name will taste as sweet  To compliment our savory course, these recipes show us how sweet our simple rice could be.    Clotilde gave us her enticing  Riz au Lait  la Framboise , a grandmotherly dessert that looked anything but granmother-like.  Petra, who normally blogs in German (and Germany) did her  Creamy Rice Terrine with Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote  blog in English especially for us.    Donna from There's a Chef in My Kitchen sent us a lovely  Amaretto Risotto Torte , a classic Bolognese dessert, adapted to fit her kitchen in central Pennsylvania.    Chocolate Rice Pudding , by Jennifer of The Domestic Goddess.  The recipe was from Chocolate Desserts by Pierre Herm, inspired by Alberto's blog on Herm's book that was, in turn, inspired by my blog on my recent visit there.  Isn't it such a small world we live in?  From the UK, Jackie at the Daily Bread, sent  Rice Pudding for babies , but I'm sure adults would like it too.  Deb, of In My Kitchen, sent  Empanadas de Arroz con Leche  (Rice Pudding Turnovers), a nice little twist in the rice pudding theme.    We have three coconut rice pudding recipe.  The first one from Amy, of Cooking with Amy in San Francisco, who is away on vacation but was nice enough to leave us her  recipe .  The second one, from Seattle, The Prim Optimist Seattle Bon Vivant gave  her own rendition  of this classic.  And, last but not least, Bill, aka Redfusion, from Live Journal also made us one , inspired by Amy's post.   Mia of Nosh, sent a very simple but gorgeous looking  Rice-stuffed Apples .  Adam, of the Amateur Gourmet fame, sent me rolling on the floor laughing with his hilarious  Condoleezza Rice Pudding with Berries of Mass Destruction .   And my Coup de CSur is Robyn's loving tribute to his mom.  Constraint by her limited resource, his single mother came up with an ingenious rice dish to give her children a little treat.  Her  Glorified Rice  is perhaps the simplest and most humble recipe in our bunch, but it is, at the same time, far more glorious than any rice dish I have seen from any famous chef.    And just a little fashionably late is Creen of On My Plate from sunny Hawaii, who showed us a little sweet taste of her home in the Phillipines in the form of  Suman , a sweet little banana leaf packet of delectable sticky rice.   Drink your rice  Two recipes remind us that rice is not just for eating.  Barrett, a pesco-ovo-lacto-vegetarian from Chicago, and one chef too many at Too Many Chefs, implored us to drink our rice with his version of  Horchata de arroz  (Horchata from Rice)  Not to be outdone, Josh of The Food Section in NY also brought us his very own rendition of  classic Horchata .  And, I don't know how I missed this, but Jen, who insists that life begins at 30, also sends  her own version .  Thus concluded our fascinating tour around the world in 50 bowls of rice.  I do hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  Thank you so much to everyone for participating and sharing a bit of your life with us.

It is always in fun time at my house especially with all the decorations, food and activities. If you especially liked your decorations this year, make your 2008 holiday decorating a breeze by taking photos of each room with each decoration in place. For instance did you enjoy the look of the bathroom? Take a photo. How about the kitchen or dinning room buffet? Take pictures of these areas so you remember what items went where. If you dont get a chance to take the photos right the location of the item on a piece of tape or  post it note  and attach to the bottom of the item. If there are a few items left over in you holiday supply that didnt get used this year, write that down on the post in note  Did not use 2007. If you dont use them again in 2008 you might want to rethink storing for 2009. Bonus tip  Store each room of decorations together. Be sure to pack delicate items carefully in smaller  boxes with compartments  or wrap in  bubble wrap  and tissue. Happy Packing!

I can remember only 1 year that I gave them Christmas presents they actually enjoyed.  I usually fall into the trap of getting the wrong gifts and I can tell they are really not interested. I dont buy the coolest or the latest for them because I just dont know what to buy. So this year they are all getting gift cards to  Starbucks  and  Mcdonalds . I figure its just like money and they will actually use them. It took me all of about 30 minutes to buy for ten people. That was easy for me and Im sure they will all be happy. I will keep you posted on the Christmas gift reactions!

Did you find a container to hold all of your change? Well, if you have been filling up your container and havent had a chance to drop if off at the bank or coin machine give it to a good cause. Bring the container full of change to your local shopping center and give it to your  Salvation Army   Red Kettle.  Volunteers are outside ringing the bell of hope and would be thrilled to have you pour all of your loose change in the kettle.

We stopped using these supersized bowls and now they were taking up way too much prime real estate in the cabinet. So, I stuck them in a bag and lined them up by the door for the next donation run. As it turned out my husbands holiday work party was the next day and they were having a gift exchange called the  white elephant . This is where you give a gift that is gently used. He was trying to figure out what to give and I said bring those  pasta bowls ! He was a little hesitant because he thought nobody would want these bowls. He also had to carry them on the bus and walk 3 blocks to work. I convinced him to take them for the exchange and it turned out the recipient absolutely LOVED them! Its a great feeling to give away something that does not work with your lifestyle any longer. We enjoyed them for a time but things change and were no longer needed them. We said goodbye to large pasta bowls. It doesnt mean weve given up pasta, it just means weve of an opted for  smaller bowls  that also double as soup bowls.

But all the prep and clean up can be a litttle discouraging. This year make it easy on yourself by pre measuring each of the ingredients before you start mixing, baking and eating. Here are my tips for easy baking 1 - Set out all of your mixing bowls, measuring cups, spoons and ingredients. 2 Separate each recipe card by about a 12. You will need plenty of room on your baking surface for the bowls of ingredients you are about to measure. 3- Measure dry ingredients such as flour, salt and baking soda for each recipe into a small bowl. As you measure each ingredient cross it off your recipe card. Use another small bowl for the sugars, a large bowl for the butter and a smaller bowl for the eggs and vanilla. Keep the recipe and bowls together so they do not get mixed up with the other recipes 4-Put away all your supplies like bags of flour sugars and boxes of baking soda, salt and toss those eggs shells. Now your space is clear of extra ingredients and now you can get ready for the mixing! 5 -Work on one recipe at a time, bake a few test cookies then conitinue baking the rest of the batch.  We made 3 different types of cookies but did not want to have cookie baking overload. So we rolled up the rest of the cookie dough, separated into batches of 8 and put in the freezer. So the next time my sister has a holiday get together she can have a few different varieties of freshly baked holiday cookies. Happy Baking!

I love the festivities the holidays bring. The lights, parties, seeing friends, family and of course the gifts! But sometimes during all the excitement we forget to play it safe especially while shopping for all of those gifts. This year clear out your  wallet  of any unnecessary credit cards and personal information just in case you loose your wallet. You will have piece of mind knowing you only need to cancel one lost card instead of 10. By removing additional cards your holiday purchases will be easier to calculate post holiday.

I'm on  Twitter as @rosso My mom enjoyed showing me “her” New Mexico and we took a short trip up to  Santa Fe  for a few days since it’s a hot spot and the state’s capital.    I enjoyed Santa Fe: there are a ton of art galleries and it actually has a historic center much like a “ centro ” in an Italian town that is quaint and fun to walk around.  Wikipedia says it’s actually the 3rd largest art market in the US after New York, and L.A.  but, since I have limited luggage space, and perhaps even a more limited budget, shopping for art wasn’t very appealing to me. The  Santa Fe Opera  opened its season on Friday evening and though we had an opportunity to buy tickets, they were the last pair at $170 each and since we were lucky enough to go to the  Palais Garnier in Paris  last September for cheaper than that, we felt we should pass.   What I really enjoyed was the trip we took to  Taos , a city about 1 hour northeast of Santa Fe. The highlight for me was visiting the  Taos Pueblo , a Native American reservation and World Heritage site.    I am sharing these pictures with you because I encourage you to visit it, and I thought it was a special place.  Please note that these pictures are for personal use and will not be published or sold commercially, in accordance with the request of the Taos Pueblo.   We spent quite a long time talking to the inhabitants and families of the pueblo which, though they are not pictured here, are definitely the most interesting part of the pueblo. Each one had a different story to tell about their family, what they do, or something to impart on their Native American heritage.    I spent some time talking with one of the inhabitants about their history and how I felt the Europeans might be more interested and informed about Native American history than some Americans (myself included). I was sad that S couldn’t be there with us, since he’s really interested and educated about it.    I did my part, though, and at a certain point I gave one of the jewelers some photography tips so that he could photograph his work and show his customers on days when he was all sold out (the day we were there). We also took home a CD of “ Totemic Flute Chants ” by Johnny Whitehorse (pseudonym of  Pueblo native  Robert Mirabal ) which has some relaxing flute compositions and chanting (and it won a Grammy!).    I mentioned the “faux” adobe phenomenon in New Mexico, in which houses are stylized after traditional adobe made of mud and straw. At the Taos Pueblo, this is the real thing. The main buildings are purported to have been  constructed between 1000 and 1450 AD, making them the longest continuously inhabited dwellings in the US.      Here’s some detail of the adobe. What I really loved was how every once and a while, some color would pop out at you from the earth-colored adobe. You can clearly see the straw that is mixed in with the mud and clay. Being inside these buildings was remarkably cool when compared to the hot temperatures outside!     Interestingly enough, the Catholic church is still present even on a Native American reservation.  The Indians on this reservation are 90% Catholic.  I loved these stained glass windows.      One of most interesting parts about the Taos Pueblo is their cemetery. The old bell tower stands at attention in the distance, watching over the myriad of different colors and materials that make up the headstones in this cemetery.      And you know that even on an Native American reservation, I manage to find food. We tried the traditional  Indian Frybread / Fry Bread , which was strikingly similar to the  Pettole I eat in Puglia at Christmas . They told us that traditionally the frybread was fried in the buffalo lard remaining and that it was eaten during feast days, but now they make it often for us tourists. It was delicious!      This was an apple, prune and pine nut turnover pastry, and it was good, too! It’s nice to enjoy something else handmade other than the traditional jewelry and pottery widely available at the Pueblo.     Have you been to Taos Pueblo, or another Native American reservation?                     11 Comments                  11 responses so far ↓                             1         Erin         // Jul 7, 2008 at 5:54 pm            What a fun trip.  That fry bread looks so good!  I’ve had this weird obsession with it ever since I read The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven by Sherman Alexie in high school.  I can’t bring myself to make it though … I draw the line at frying foods in my kitchen for the most part.  I’m dangerous enough with just a pan and a whisk ;)                                  2         Cristina        // Jul 7, 2008 at 8:33 pm            I just came across your blog today as I was recipe blog hopping.  I saw your first post earlier today and did not have time to respond until now.  What I was going to say this morning is that Northern New Mexico and Southern New Mexico are entirely different places culturally, but now I see that you are visiting N. NM and experiencing it for yourself.  My parents have a small ranch in the mountains between Santa Fe and Taos so we consider the region home even though we have been living in Europe since 2002. We spent three years living near Lago di Garda and exploring much of Italy but have now moved north and are enjoying living in the “heart” of Western Europe.     I don’t know if you have had a chance to make it to Sardegna yet; but as we travelled around the island there were certain elements of both geography and architecture that struck us as having the familiar feeling of home - - unfortunately, N. NM is not surrounded by the same beautiful mare, or any mare for that matter, as Sardegna!   Looking forward to keeping up with your blog!                                  3         Maryann         // Jul 7, 2008 at 9:39 pm            I found more of an interest and respect for Native tribes from Europeans as well. Many collectors there used to buy my beadwork (my other grandma was Lakota Sioux).  We make the fry bread with a little hole poked in the center. We top it with ground beef, cheese, onions, tomatoes..kinda like a taco! They are just soooo goooood!                                  4         gregjsmith@mac.com         // Jul 7, 2008 at 10:41 pm            Belated welcome to New Mexico.

We spent some time there a couple of years ago and loved it.  My Italian LOVES southwest Indian stuff.  and it is very interesting.  I keep trying to get him into my Cherokee heritage but for him - the Southwest tribes are the best.lol Thanks for the post.   yummmmm…fry bread…                                  8         janie         // Jul 9, 2008 at 2:21 pm            The fry bread reminds me of fried pizza that my grandmother made (she was from Campagna) and was topped  with tomato sauce and grated romano.                                  9         Piccola         // Jul 9, 2008 at 10:59 pm            I used to date a Navajo guy and got to travel to many Indian Reservations throughout the states going to powwows and various religious ceremonies. Those were some of the most memorable moments in my life. I got to witness ceremonies that unless you are invited, can not be attended by outsiders. And I have had my share of frybread! I have had frybread with honey and powdered sugar, or with ground meat, lettuce and tomatoes also known as a Navajo taco. The best flour to use for frybread is called Blue bird. Frybread can be addicting, but you have to be careful or you will be classified as a “frybread fatty”…haha!                                  10         Jessica, Italy Logue         // Jul 11, 2008 at 8:15 pm            Frybread is, perhaps, one of my favorite food stuffs on earth…                                  11         Valerie         // Jul 23, 2008 at 3:21 pm            Hey, you’re in my stomping grounds!  Have some green chile for me (or better, bring some back! ;)  Taos is gorgeous, one of my favorite areas of the state.  The Pueblo looks like a multi-tiered sand castle from a distance.

To generate interest, read a story about Brazil. Ask students to discuss and describe literature that has been read to them.   On a map or globe, locate the setting of the story. Have students demonstrate their knowledge of literature that has been read to them.   Use world map or globe (use world ball if available) to show the location of Brazil relative to Florida.   Using the map or globe, have students identify the Atlantic Ocean as east of Brazil.   Have students identify the locations of at least three countries relative to Brazil.   Close with the following cheer: ""North, South, East, West: Finding Brazil is My Quest"".      Extensions      Students will retell story by sequencing events which the teacher will write on chart paper.   Have students practice recognition of cardinal directions. Do this by passing out flash cards, each of which has a cardinal direction written on it.  Have students ""travel"" to the corner of the room that represents the direction of the card.      Evaluation      Create a drawing of the story.   Students locate and identify Brazil on a map or globe.   Students indicate the cardinal directions by pointing to north, south, east, west on a map.          ACTIVITY 2  How Big Am I ?       Materials         outline map of Brazil      outline map of Florida      outline map of Mainland U.S.A.      outline map of South America      world map on wall   globe   playdough      Procedure      Using world map or globe, students will locate Brazil and Florida.   General discussion on physical shape of Brazil and Florida to explain how they are similar or different. Review characteristics of geometric forms.   Students will use maps of Brazil and Florida to cut out and compare size of their masses. Refer to map handouts.   Using maps of South America, each student will identify the largest country by coloring it red and the smallest country by coloring it yellow. Use maps provided.       Enrichment: Students may create their own key for smallest and largest country.      Extensions      By using maps of Brazil and the mainland United States, compare sizes of the two countries.   Compare sizes to country that has been previously studied.      Evaluation      Students will explore the shape of Brazil by covering a blank map with playdough.          ACTIVITY 3  When You're Hot, You're Hot!       Materials      globe   world map on wall   yarn   large flashlight   teacher produced 4' or larger circle   pre-cut figures (shapes):  red, blue, yellow   stickers:  red, blue, yellow      Procedures       Using a wall map of the world, show the location of the equator.   To demonstrate the concept of the equator, have students stand in a circle shoulder to shoulder facing out. Teacher places yarn around the circle and students hold it about waist-high, to represent the equator. Students slowly move in a clockwise direction. As they move, the teacher shines the flashlight directly on the yarn to emulate the rays and the warmth of the sunlight on the earth.   Generate discussion by asking such questions as: Where on your body did you feel the heat? Why did you feel the heat there? How much of the warmth did you feel on your head? On your feet?   Draw a circle on the board and place a symbol where the North and South Poles would be located on a globe. Draw a line to represent the equator. Tell the students that this represents the yarn they held. The North Pole represents their heads and the South Pole represents their feet. Have the students place red stickers on the line that was the hottest, blue stickers on the symbols that would have been the coldest, and yellow on the warm areas.      Extensions      Create a picture to describe how temperature can affect ways that you dress.   Read All in a Day by Eric Carle; discuss difference in seasons and time      Evaluation      Using teacher-made 4' or larger circles with equator illustrated, students will pick out of the bag one pre-cut red, yellow or blue figure (shapes) and place in correct temperature zones (red = hot, blue = cold, and yellow = warm).          ACTIVITY 4  From Emerald Forest To Golden Plateau       Teacher Background     Amazon region: This region covers the northern and western part of Brazil. It has a humid tropical climate. Dense forests have limited settlement and make transportation difficult. Rivers are the main means of transportation in the Amazon Basin.     Brazilian highlands: This is a region of old, heavily eroded mountains that rarely rise above 9,000 feet and is located on the east coast of Brazil.     Brazilian plateau: This region is a vast upland plain found west of the coastal highlands.      Materials      world map on wall   large physical map of South America (optional)      outline map of land regions      of Brazil      art supplies   video on physical features of Brazil (optional)      Procedure      Read a story to generate interest about the regions of Brazil (See bibliography for suggested stories).   Ask students to discuss and describe literature that has been read.   On large world map, locate the origin of the story. Review cardinal directions and concepts.   Using a map, show the location of several different regions in Brazil: Amazon Region, Brazilian Highlands, Brazilian Plateau.   Using the regions of Brazil map have students work in groups and color in the three land regions and label the Amazon River.   Review the completed map of regions by calling groups of students to discuss regions.      Extensions      Using an outline map of Brazil and map symbols the students will create a regional pictorial map of Brazil.  See included sample map.      Evaluation      Use number five in the procedure for evaluation.          ACTIVITY 5  Habitat for All       Teacher Background     The layers of the rain forest consist of the following:     Forest Floor: The soil is infertile and thin, yet many creatures live in and use this damp, dim layer to hunt for food. This layer is made of fungi, mosses, and decaying leaves. It is populated with ocelots, ta-pirs, jaguars, snakes and butterflies, to name a few.     Bushy Understory:  This layer is made up of scrubs, ferns, small palms, and small plants. It is populated with monkeys, ants and snakes.     Canopy: This interwoven layer is made of intertwined branches and lianes (vines). The canopy which reaches 70-90 feet high is filled with birds. Monkeys, snakes, sloths and other creatures also make their way up the canopy.     Emergent: The top layer is made up of tall, ancient trees that rise above the rain forest's canopy. This layer is home to a variety of birds and butterflies.  Some ancient trees can reach heights of 200 feet.      Materials      At Home in the Rain Forest by Diane Willow or Rain Forest by Helen Cowcher   study prints of rain forest layers   chalkboard   art supplies: 18""-by -24"" manila paper, 12""-by-18"" construction paper, tempera paints, brushes, crayons, scissors, glue, bulletin board paper      Procedure      Read At Home in the Rain Forest, or literature related to the rain forest.   Use story to weave an ""imaginary journey"" to the emerald forest of Brazil:       "" On this journey we will share the rain forest with a myriad of creatures and plants with all the colors of the rainbow.  As we travel deeper into the emerald forest, we will become a member of a very special Indian tribe, the Amazonian Jivaros.  The journey to our new village will take us through the rain forest ecosystem, which has more variety than the ocean. The rain forest is made of four basic layers. Each layer is a mini-system. Some creatures go from layer to layer, others live in just one. Each layer is dependent on the other one"".       On board illustrate the four basic layers or show study prints, if available.  Review layers and explain that over the next couple of days the class will create a mural of a rain forest near its new village.     DAY 1:     Divide class into 4 groups of students; each group will explore one different layer of the rain forest.  Have resource materials available.   Group 1:  Forest Floor  Using 12""-by-18"" construction paper this group will paint or color mosses, mushrooms, leaves, and small ferns.    Group 2:  Scrub Understory. On 12""-by-18"" construction paper students will paint or color seedlings, ferns, bushes, scrubs, and small palms.    Group 3:  Canopy Working on 18""-by-24"" manila paper this group will paint or color trees horizontally on paper. Provide study prints of trees and lianes (vines).    Group 4:  Emergent Layer  On 18""-by-24"" manila paper this group will be responsible for painting or coloring large tall trees vertically on paper. Provide study prints of tall trees.       Allow paintings to dry overnight.     DAY 2:     Students will cut out painted or colored plant life.   Students will sort and categorize different plant forms into the 4 basic layers of the rain forest.   Using bulletin board paper as a backdrop, have students demonstrate where each layer should be placed. Starting with the emergent layer, glue onto the bulletin board paper each remaining layer in the correct sequence.   Have students review and describe completed mural of the rain forest ecosystem.      Extensions      Using magazines students can cut out different height trees and plant life making individual collages to represent rain forest layers.   Teacher can bring into classroom different height trees and plants making an imaginary rain forest reading corner complete with mini-hammock loaded with books.   Create large wall mural with plant life, using painted animals hiding in foliage.   Students can create a Rain Forest Light Print- arrange greenery on blueprint paper, expose arrangement to light such as, overhead projector, place in ammonia solution to stop exposure, watch print develop.      Evaluation      Participation in classroom activities.          ACTIVITY 6  Rainbows of Flowers       Materials      Something Wonderful Happened by Jane E. Givens   study prints of bromeliads   study prints of orchids   collection of live orchid and bromeliad plants (optional)   photographs of orchids and bromeliads   art supplies:  watercolors, watercolor paper, black crayon      Procedure      Teacher: set up classroom display of tropical rainforest plants that bloom or arrange for a presentation from the Orchid Society or Bromeliad Society from your local city.   Describe the bromeliad plant, which is a member of the pineapple family. A bromeliad seed is dropped by a bird into a crook of a tree limb, where it ""nests"".  The plant opens up like flowers with a circular pattern of strong, broad leaves, which form a bowl that collects rainwater. This tiny pool forms a home to snails, salamanders, frogs and crabs.   Describe the orchid plant to the class. Orchids cling to trees and draw water from their surfaces. These exquisite colorful flowers attract beautiful butterflies and hummingbirds who act as pollinators as they sip the flowers' nectar.   Have students compare and contrast these two different plants. Both are epiphytes; plants that derive moisture from air and rain. How are they similar and/or different?   Write on chart paper the following:  Orchids - Bromeliads  broad leaves colorful flowers thin long leaves colored leaves single bloom multiple blooms grows in dirt lives on trees   Students may add categories if necessary.     As students respond to each observation, the teacher will mark appropriate line.   Discuss observation results.   Students will draw with a black crayon either a bromeliad or orchid on watercolor paper and then paint using watercolors. When dry, teacher can mount using art work for a classroom art gallery which features Brazilian folkart.      Extension      Using green construction paper, students cut out enough broad leaves to cover paper cup. With pencil, punch hole in bottom of cup. Glue leaves around cup.  On a straw glue a drawing of an animal that uses the bromeliad as a home. (Make sure student colors front and back of animal.) Put straw in the cup and push through the hole. Make the animal pop out by pushing the straw up. Cut out roots to hang around the bottom of the cup to hide the straw.      Evaluation      Participation in classroom activities and completion of watercolor picture.          ACTIVITY 7  Everything is Coming Up Rosy Periwinkles       Teacher Background     Many tropical plants contain natural ingredients that can be used for medicine.  To date over 3,000 plants have been identified as having anti-cancer properties; of these, 70% live in the rain forest.  The rosy periwinkle produces a substance used to counteract leukemia in children. This tropical plant allows a child with lymphocytic leukemia a 99% chance of remission, compared to 20% before the drug was discovered. This substance is also being used to fight Hodgkin's disease, cervical cancer, and breast cancer.      Materials      photographs of periwinkle plants   blooming periwinkle plant   soil   planting cups   periwinkle seeds   drawing paper   crayons   My Plant by Herbert H. Wong      Procedure      Discuss the importance of tropical plants in fighting cancer. Explain that out of the 3,000 plants found to fight cancer, 70% live in the rain forest environment.   Draw a circle on the chalkboard and shade in 70% of the area to demonstrate that 70% of the cancer-fighting plants live in the rain forest. (Divide circle into 10 equal pie pieces and shade in 7.) Generate a discussion on the importance of saving the rain forests around our Earth.   Generate the concept that the growth and use of plants are an important part of the environment:  they produce oxygen, provide food for animals, and provide medicine for people.   Explain that the class is going to explore the stages of growth in a plant from seed, to seedling and to mature plant. Integrate this activity with your science curriculum.   Review the stages of growth with the students.   Ask the students to explain to you the steps involved in planting seeds. If no one has planted seeds before, explain to them the steps involved in planting the seeds.   Have each student plant their periwinkle seeds in their cups.   Close the lesson by stating that light and water are necessary for normal plant growth.   Either send the planted seed cups home or use them as a class project.      Extensions      Use the lesson as a class science fair activity, following the normal science fair guidelines.   Chart the growth of the seedlings using different variables such as sunlight and water.      Evaluation      Each student will draw the stages of growth of a plant first as a seed, then as a seedling, and finally as a matured plant.          ACTIVITY 8  Rain Forest Terrariums       Teacher Background     A Terrarium and Why it Works     Plants will not suffocate in a closed container because they can use the same air over and over again.  In daylight, plants take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. Using carbon dioxide and light plants produce food. At all times plants use food and oxygen to produce energy, which turns into carbon dioxide again.  Water is also recycled in a terrarium. This happens as plants take water from the soil and then release it through their leaves as water vapor. In a closed container, this vapor turns into water droplets.  The water drips back into the soil to be used all over again.     Discuss how the rain forest helps the whole Earth's ecosystem as it continues to function as a closed environment. Use the air in the bottle to simulate the Earth's atmosphere. The plants change carbon dioxide into oxygen and the Amazon Rain Forest sends the fresh air out to the whole world.      Materials      2 clear 2-liter plastic soda bottles   tropical house plants   seeds:         carrot (for the fluffy fern-like plants)     bean seeds (to simulate vines)     passion flower seeds       soil   Funtime Indoor Gardening by Cameron Yerian      Procedure      Directions for making terrariums.         Rinse out the plastic soda bottles.     Cut the plastic bottle about midway. You will use only the rounded clear part for this project (Save the top part for a funnel to use in a different project or recycle it.)     Pull the colored bottom away from the clear plastic.     Fill the colored plastic bottom of the bottle with soil.     Arrange the plants in the soil. Drop seeds around the soil.     Add about one-eighth of a cup of water to the soil.     Place clear plastic rounded part tightly on colored bottom.     Do not open again. The water cycle will be working.       Display the terrariums on a window ledge.   Students can note the plant growth by taking daily measurements on the outside of the bottle.   Check the water cycle by moving the terrariums into the sun and then into the shade. They will see condensation form inside the bottle and then watch as the water drops fall back down into the miniature rain forest.   Practice predicting and observation skills as the rain forest begins to thrive.   When the unit is finished, plant the seedlings in a larger space.      Extension      Use a large glass jar and lid for a terrarium.      Evaluation      Explain and describe the process and steps of making a terrarium.          ACTIVITY 9  Fluttering Feathered Friends       Teacher Background     Brightly colored rain forest birds use their hues to attract mates. Splashed with bold beautiful markings, birds such as the toucan, parrot, macaw, rufous motmot, flamingo, hornbill, and hummingbird provide a display against the emerald green backdrop of the forest. 2,600 species of birds are found in the rain forest.

Ferreira      Procedure      Discuss photographs of birds, how they are similar/different. Encourage all students to participate in discussion.   Explain that the class is going to make papier-mache birds. Divide class into small groups, no more than 5 in a group. Each group will choose a bird to make.   Have balloon forms ready to use.  One large oval balloon for the body, one small round balloon for the head.   Tape the head and body using masking tape.   Pour the starch into a low bowl. Place each strip of newspaper in the starch holding on to the end of the strip. As you remove the strip, let it rub over the edge of the bowl to remove excess starch.  Place the strip over the balloon.  Continue until all of the balloons are covered with newspaper strips.   Take strips of brown paper towels and follow the above steps.   Allow the papier-mache to dry. Rotate resting place to insure that the bird is dry all over. This may take 3 to 4 days.   Make a beak out of posterboard rolled into a cone shape. The size of the beak is determined by the type of bird that the group is making. Tape the beak to the head of the bird.   Have the students working in each group paint their birds to represent the actual tropical bird chosen.  When this is dry, use feathers to add the crowns, wings, and tail feathers.   Display by hanging from ceiling.      Extensions      Allow each student to make individual birds out of papier-mache.   Visit the local zoo to view birds and animals.      Evaluation      Participation in papier-mache activity.

Discuss the stories by having the students retell them.   Explain that the students are going to create Brazilian tropical birds.   Have large and small oval construction shapes ready for students to choose from.   Provide construction paper to use for feathers. Demonstrate what students will be doing by showing the steps to follow in making the bird.   Demonstrate to the students how to make feathers by tearing construction paper.   Cut out a shape and style of beak and glue to the head of the bird. Cut out the wings and glue to the body. Glue the head and the body together.   Glue the feathers to the bird's body. Make sure you do not forget the crown and the tail feathers.   Add long strips of black paper for the legs. This is very colorful when the students paint designs of the legs.   Review the parts of the bird.  Is anything missing?  Oops, don't forget the eyes. Display the birds in your Brazilian Art Gallery.

Evaluation      Completed field guide can be used for informal evaluation.   Complete booklet on animals of the rain forest.          ACTIVITY 11  Amazon Adventure       Teacher Background     The Amazon River is over 4,000 miles long. There is no single source for the river. It captures water from hundreds of streams and lakes, 15,000 feet high in the Andes Mountains. It travels eastward across the continent. It tumbles down the mountainsides in a rush of white, foaming water. A boat journey is impossible at this point. As the river reaches jungle level, it slows down. Halfway along its length it reaches Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon River region. In the lowland areas of the Amazon Basin it is hot and humid, with daily rain. The river floods the jungle sometimes to a depth of 40 feet or so. At the end of its course, the Amazon drops its load of silt to form a group of islands. This area is called a delta. Where the Amazon meets the Atlantic, it measures 200 miles from one bank to the other. At the mouth is the port, Belem. This port handles all the boats that sail up the Amazon. The Amazon is navigable by ocean-going ships for about 2,300 miles from its mouth.      Materials      large wall map of United States   large wall map of Brazil   chalkboard   study prints of Amazon River   National Geographic videos: Amazon: Land of the Flooded Forest (C51297); Amazon  (C51003)   art Supplies; tempera paint and paper   The Amazon River by Charles R. Joy      Procedure      Show parts of video on the Amazon River (if available).   Using guided imagery continue our journey to the village deep in the rain forest, now sail on a Jangada (raft), west up the Amazon River searching for the trail that will lead to the village. As we float on the mighty Amazon we pass gigantic Victoria water lilies over 5 feet across blooming with large white flowers. We might spy a golden 30 foot anaconda among the lilies. If we are very quiet, we might see the giant otter, which is over 5 feet long. Sunning on the river bank the caiman may be resting.       With over 2,400 species of fish swimming in the waters of the Amazon you are not sure what is underneath our Jangada. A few of the fish you might view: electric eels can reach up to 6 feet long, piranhas are colorful red and blue with sharp teeth. They are about 14 inches long. The bouto is a freshwater dolphin about 3 to 5 feet long and pink in color. The arapaima can grow to be 10 feet long and weigh 300 pounds. Sting rays have flat bodies and hide in the sand.       As we glide along we hear an odd mixture of screeching insects, birds and animals, followed at times by a sudden unexpected moment of silence. Before we know it, we see a clearing in the lush jungle and the Indians standing on the river's edge greeting the new members of their tribe.       Have students orally retell journey up the Amazon River. As students sequence the events, teacher writes on chalkboard. Review what you have written by having students read events that are in sequence.   Using a large map of Brazil demonstrate location of the Amazon River. Using a string demonstrate length of the Amazon River by holding one end to the mouth and the other end to the source of the Amazon River.   Have students place string on map of the United States from coast to coast.  Generate discussion on length of the Amazon River compared to the length of the U.S.A.   If you placed the string on map showing your city, how far north could you travel with the string? How far south would the string reach? How far west would it reach? What direction did we not try? (east)   Review the journey up the Amazon River. Reread sequential events written on the chalkboard.   Using bulletin board paper each student will paint a fish found in the Amazon River. Fish will be stuffed with paper and stapled around the edges.   To make this fish symmetrical a few steps need to be followed:         Using large bulletin board paper (color student's choice) fold in half-length wise. Using black marker student draws fish outline on one side, folded edge will be used as back tail section.     Now flip paper over and trace fish outline onto blank side.     Open out paper and you should have a symmetrical drawing.     Students paint both sides to look the same.       When dry, cut out around fish. Teacher will stuff with paper and staple around the edges.      Extensions      Discuss ways to travel on the Amazon River. Indians most commonly use dugouts and rafts. Floating stores are found in the cities along the river. The rafts are called Jangadas. Have students make a jangada, by lashing or glueing together seven logs(sticks).  Use a twig for the mast (stick it in playdough) and a piece of bright cloth for a sail.   Students can create a story about a journey up the Amazon River.   Teacher can use descriptions of fish for a daily narrative for handwriting practice.   Construct a whole fleet of Brazilian vessels to travel the Amazon River using trays, milk cartons, and egg trays. Floating stores, restaurants, churches and even gas stations travel up and down the Amazon River.      Evaluations       Classroom participation.   Language experience story - students will dictate retelling of the Amazon River journey or if appropriate students will write own story about journey.

Teacher Directions      Color and cut out cover sheet, mount it on legal size envelope.   Color figs a pinkish green, cut out and laminate.   Color Macaws, cut and laminate.   Print correct answers on the back of each Macaw.          ACTIVITY 14  Jivaro Jungle Maloca       Teacher Background     The Jivaros are a tribe of Brazilian Indians who move their villages every 5 to 6 years. A Jivaro village consists of a single communal house occupied by a patrilineal extended family. Patrilineal means that family members are related through the male line. Women, after marriage, usually live in the village of their husbands. The extended family consists of the husband's parents and other relatives such as his brothers and their wives and children. Houses are called Malocas. They are usually built on a hilltop or at the bend of a stream for defense reasons. The house is 50 to 100 feet long, with straight sides and rounded ends. Walls are constructed of vertical poles and the roof is thatched.  The tall narrow doors at each end are securely closed at night with wooden planks. Fifteen to forty-six people live in the house. The women and small children occupy the left half and the men the right; each is accessible by a small separate entrance. The men sleep on platforms (about 5 feet by 4 feet and raised 12 inches above the floor) built along a wall.     Feasts are held on four occasions: for boys at the age of 15, for the girls at the time of marriage, for dogs when their training is complete, and for young children. Members of nearby villages are invited to participate in the ceremonies (feasting and dancing, which lasts for five or six days). These rituals are thought to impart strength and long life to the honored individual and to ensure abundant harvest and plentiful game.     The Jivaro envision the world as containing spirits that inhabit humans, animals, plants, and geographical features (such as hills, rapids, and volcanoes).  The spirits often enter certain animals, especially the deer and the tapir, and, for this reason the people say, deer and tapir are not eaten.     Curing of sickness is the main function of the shaman, but the Jivaro believe through his control over the spirit, the shaman can also influence and cause death or illness. He receives little material advantage from his role. On the contrary, he may be viewed as a sorcerer and may become a primary target for blood revenge. Many years ago, the shaman was in charge of shrinking heads of slain warriors of hostile tribes.  Of course, this practice is now prohibited by law.  Today, the Jivaro only shrink heads of animals they have hunted. They hang the heads outside their houses to show their bravery.      Materials      chart paper   markers   drawing paper   crayons      drawings of Malocas        Procedure       Teacher describes the village and house where the Indians live. Show students drawings of Malocas or use as a worksheet.   Have students retell the description of the Malocas.  Using two chart papers label one Jivaro Malocas and label the other Florida House. Elicit from students characteristics of both. Compare and analyze the two charts to discover how they are alike and different.   Lead discussion on advantages and disadvantages to living in a Malocas or the house that we live in.  List responses on chalkboard.   Have students discuss how the Malocas are built.  Where do they buy the supplies? (Students should generalize that materials must be found in the area in which the Indians live.)   Review background information with students.      Extensions      Working in small groups students will write and illustrate a story about building a Maloca in the Brazilian rain forest.   Working in small groups students will write and illustrate a story about building a house in Florida (your city).   Have students make model of a malocas using a shoe-box, sticks, and straw for the roof.      Evaluation      Have students draw a picture of a Malocas and a picture of their own home.          ACTIVITY 15  What's for dinner?       Teacher Background     Women have the task of planting, weeding and harvesting. The most important staple of the Jivaro diet is sweet manioc. Also found in the garden are: peach palm fruit, sweet potatoes, yams, squash, papaya, peanuts, bananas, plantain, maize, and sugarcane.     Men have the task of planting maize, cotton, and barbasco (fish poison). The men hunt with dogs that are specially trained for hunting. Blowguns are used to hunt birds, monkeys, sloths, capyvararos (tailless, largely aquatic, rodent often exceeding 4 feet in length), anteaters, and cayman. Use of the bow and blowgun are very important because they are silent weapons. Fishing is also done by men and boys. Several methods are used: catching with bare hands, harpooning, hook and line, netting and poisoning. Jivaro eat a number of insects. Red ants and the white grub of the chonta beetle are especially favored. The eggs of turtles and alligators are another delicacy.      Materials      art supplies   paper glue   magazines   chalkboard   handwriting paper   food for tasting party      Procedure      Teacher describes food that the Jivaro have available. List on the board types of food found in the Jivaro village. Elicit from the students types of food that they eat.   Compare the two lists: what items are similar and/or different? What food would you like to try?   Have students place food into two lists; gathered and hunted. Explained that women have the task of planting, weeding and harvesting. Men and boys hunt.   Have students write food list for meat category into alphabetical order.   Review the correct order of food list.      Extensions      Using magazines, student will make a food collage of plants found in the garden of the Jivaro family.   Have a food tasting party. Serve boiled peanuts, yam cakes, bananas, sugarcane, plantation chips, papaya, and chocolate covered ants (raisins).   Grow a sweet potato vine in the classroom.   Plant a classroom garden with squash, corn and peanuts.      Evaluations      Students will participate in classroom activities.          ACTIVITY 16  Making a Living       Teacher Background     Women perform earth-related activities including: gardening, pottery-making, cotton-dyeing, cooking, preparing drinks, caring for the children and dogs, and carrying water. Men perform all tasks involving wood, such as: house, bed, and loom construction; canoe making, carving paddles, drum, lances, blowguns, weapons, and shields. They also weave baskets, spin and weave cloth, and make many of the ornaments they wear.     Materials       chalkboard   paper bag   teacher-made index cards   either job title or picture of job      Procedure      Teacher: list tasks on board, without reference to males or females. Describe jobs or work-related activity.   Have students discuss the tasks and chose at least two that interest them or ones that they would like to learn more about.   Have students write down the job they would like to perform to help members of the tribe.   After 3 is completed, each student will share his/ her task. Place students into groups of similar tasks.   After placing students into groups, the teacher will explain that each task is either for a man or a woman.   Generate discussions about how it feels not to be allowed to do a certain task because you are a boy or a girl.   Have students describe tasks that they do around the house or work that their parents do for a living, either in or out of their home.  List on board.   Have students compare and contrast the two societies' ways of making a living.      Evaluation      Teacher: place index cards with task titles or pictures in bag. Student will pick one out and tell about the picture and under which category it belongs (male or female).          ACTIVITY 17  Weaving       Materials      12""-by-18"" construction paper   1""-by-18"" strips of construction paper   scissors      Procedure      Teacher should have assortment of colored strips of construction paper cut into lengths about 1""-by-18"".   To make loom:         Students will fold a piece of construction paper lengthwise.     Making cuts about every one-and-a-half inches on the fold stopping about one and a half inches from the edge.     Take contrasting colors of pre-cut strips and instruct student to weave strips over and under one strip at a time.     Next row: the student alternates weaving pattern; under and over.     Continue until loom is completely filled in with colored strips.          Extension      Make a loom for each child by cutting 6 notches in both ends of a styrofoam food tray and stringing yarn through the notches. Tape the yarn ends to the end of the tray. Then let the children use the over-under method to weave strands of cloth, yarn, feathers and small sticks on their looms.      Evaluation      Student will participate in classroom activities.   Completed loom may be used for evaluation.          ACTIVITY 18  Pottery       Materials      clay   toothpicks   plastic workmat      Procedure      Teacher: give each student plastic workmat and handful of clay.   Students knead clay with hands to soften. Spray with water if needed to prevent drying out of clay.   Have students divide clay into two balls, using one ball to make a flat round base. Use the other ball to make several long thin ""snakes"". To build up the sides of the pot, coil ""snakes"" of clay one on top of the other.   Students etch designs with toothpicks into the sides of the pot.   Teacher fires in kiln.          ACTIVITY 19   Clothing       Teaching Background     The principal article of dress is a long rectangular piece of cotton cloth, which the men use as a wrap-around skirt extending from the waist to just below the knee. For special occasions feathers hang down from the waist. Women use a longer piece of cotton, which is wrapped over the right shoulder and under the left arm. When bloused out above the belt, the skirt extends to the knee. Women also wear small plugs in their lips.     Ornaments include: headbands of fur or feathers, cotton cords of necklaces made of seeds, shells, teeth, and bird feathers; and bamboo tubes with white and bright colored feathers inserted through holes in the ear lobes. Red and black paint is used to decorate their bodies.      Materials           drawings of Jivaro Indian Child            drawing paper   crayons      Procedure      Teacher describes clothing worn by women and men.   Lead discussions to explain that clothing is minimal because of the humid heat. Ornaments are used quite frequently and are very colorful.   Have students describe the different clothes they wear during the different seasons. Explain that the Jivaros live in a climate which stays the same year round and the need for different types of clothing is non-existent.   Students will make large paper models of Jivaro children.      Extensions      Students will design Jivaro headbands using feathers or beads.   Students can make necklaces of feathers, playdough, teeth, seeds or shells.

The top level is a main living space with 3 bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and dining area. (The television is usually on.)  The family uses a small open room on the side of the house for the barbecue grill. This means that they can have churrascou (shoo-RASS-co), barbecued beef, all year round. The bottom level is called a porao (po-row) which is a big room that opens onto a patio. The porao is used to store firewood, food, soap, cheese, salami, onions, and anything else they want to keep safe and dry. Monica lives in the same neighborhood as many of her relatives. Each house is very similar in style and construction. The houses are made out of wood siding, very similar to houses in Florida.  Monica has a very large yard.

                                                Pass around a bag containing an apple.   See if students can guess what is in the bag by feeling the object through the outside of the bag, by smell, etc.  Once students have                              figured out what is in the bag, give each child their own apple and use their five senses to describe it.  Show an incomplete chart that has an apple at the top and then one                              picture for each of the five senses.  This is the Five Senses Apple Description Chart.  Point to the first sense picture and have them use that sense to explore the apple.                               What words can they use to describe what they discover?   Use interactive writing to write their descriptive words.  For example, under the sense picture for sight you might                              write ""I see&red, yellow, green, round, a stem.""  For the sense of touch, you may write ""I feel&.hard, smooth.""  Complete the descriptive writing for all of the senses                               ending with taste and letting students enjoy eating their own apples!   Explain to students that all this week they will be learning more about apples and reading both fiction and non fiction stories about apples.

Take a picture                              walk, talking about the name and sound each animal makes, what they see the animals doing, the look on the farmer's face, introducing what the farmer repeatedly says, and                              making predictions as to which animal might come next in the story.  Will there be enough apples for all of them?  Stop at the page showing the farmer holding the last                              red apple.  Ask students to make predictions about what might happen next.   Read aloud for enjoyment and to see how story ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Day 2                                         Companion Poem :                                                  Reread the companion poem, 'Apple Tree', enjoying the related motions.

Have they ever seen or heard of an apple pie tree?  Is it a real tree?  What                              kind of tree do they think the author is really talking about?  Why might she have called it an apple pie tree?  Explain that this story will show us how an apple grows through                              the seasons and shows that it takes a really long time to make an apple pie!  After reading, show pictures of how an apple grows.  Have the students place the pictures in                              order so that they show the life of an apple leading up to the making of the apple pie.  (from apple seed, apple seedling, apple tree, bud, apple blossom, little green apple, big                              red apple)    If time allows make and eat  individual apple pies  today!

Place one half in a bowl and cover the apple slices with lemon juice.  Place the other half of the apple in a second                              bowl, but left exposed to the air.  Have students make predictions about what will happen to both halves of the apple.  Let set for at least half an hour.  Let students                              examine both apple halves.  How are they different?  The one in the lemon juice should look the same, but the one left out should be drier and starting to turn brown.  Why is                              it important to keep food refrigerated and/or covered up?  What happens to bread, etc. when it is left uncovered?

Well, i'd say that if you have a big budget they will take care of you very well. but if your budget is under 900$ or so, then they'll just show you a houses and basta!    Also forget about service after you signed the lease. I had a problem with my landlord as i was paying for his water and the electricity. NO help there.    Also on this very same site, i got in touch with an agent who did not advertise himself as part of Homespec; to find out he was working with them, and that the price advertised went from 900$ to 1200$ between the phone call and the visit during the same day !!!!!

I've used them twice to move furniture from one place to another. Once with a half tonne truck and once with a 1 tonne truck. With the half tonne truck on a small trip of around 15mins cost about 100k dong.    The 1 tonne truck, with some basic lifting help over about 3 hours from Hai ba trung district to the western side of Thuy Khue St, to the other side of Long Bien bridge cost us 360k + 40k tip.    It was all on the meter and a pretty fair deal really. No complaints. You will need to order a truck in Vietnamese though. No need to book well in advance, my 1 tonne truck arrived within 30 mins of calling them. Also i believe their actual contact numbers are:04 3 8733 733 or 04 3 8731 313.

Uh oh&looks like Hanoi and you good folks down at the R have caught the glassy-eyed love and attention of one of those whinge-nut butt-nuts that pass through town every now and then. Laughs, I swear each owner in town seems to get one at least once a year, some of my favorites were hearing about characters like: the guy who burst into the bar flashing a Power Rangers badge demanding the names of everyone seated for associating with communists or the guy with no shoes who wanted to kill all teachers because he couldnt get a job; my favorite was the guy who carried a briefcase filled with baseball cards caught masturbating in Lenin Park claiming to the police that he was  purposely in town to assassinate George Bush.

If you come, you should try mango jelly with milk (called ""ch xoi""), it's unique as far as I know. They also have French style baked cakes and many other foods made with milk.                        Was this review ...

This is my hangout. They provides genuine RAMEN. The most popular RAMEN in here for Japanese is ""MISO SPECIAL"" which contains a lot of vegetables with MISO soup. I think it's too salt (of course tasty) while it depends on your mouth. I'm not good at salty or spicy food. Comparing to Vietnamese market, it's pricey. But it deserves to give in a try.                       Was this review ... Well-Written   (0)         Funny   (0)         Accurate   (0)         Useful   (2)         Meh   (0)         Fail!

Much to my chagrin, I have had to visit this place twice because I was dumb enough to have one phone stolen and the other one fell out of my pocket. With pay as you go phones you might expect that once you lose your phone or have it stolen, it is all over for your old number. Well guess again, it is very possible to get your number back, even as a lowly pre-paid customer. All you have to do is rock up at one of these Mobifone shops with your passport and about 3 - 5 of the numbers that you might normally call. I rarely call anyone but the guesses I made were enough to satisfy them that I owned the number. It is bad enough losing a nice handset but to be able to retain the number kind of eases the pain. On BOTH occasions I have been there, the staff spoke English perfectly and the experience was not painful at all. I am not quite sure what the process is with the other mobile operators but suffice to say Mobifone make it relatively easy in a country that is filled with red-tape. Bravo!

Well, well, well.  Mr. Manager Jay just rated his own venue 4 stars to ""counter"" my ""bile"".  Nice work.  What, you have so little faith in your establishment that you just had to bump up your own rating?  And tell us, how many of those jaded, hunched-over burnouts did you offer a free beer to in order to get them to roll off their bar stool and click the Fail button for you?  Surely they were peeved for being forced to spare a few minutes from their normal conversation of bitching about traffic, English teachers, Vietnamese hookers, and homos.    So I returned recently to see if anything has changed since opening night.  Not really.  Same old crowd.  Oh, and that burger that everyone keeps jizzing over?  Tasted like they cut the ass end off one of those emaciated Vietnamese cows.  And I still can't figure out what they are seasoning it with.  Construction dust from the renovation?    So ""counter"" all you want.  We can go round and round like this all day.  But I can't imagine actually stepping foot in there again if it means rubbing elbows with your regulars.                       Was this review ...

A great day out with some interesting people. Big thanks to Manh loominpapa for organizing it.    The weather couldn't have been better, and the location was peaceful, putting me in the mood for taking some pictures.    There was a suggestion (a good one, I thought) that TNH Photo meetups be followed up with an opportunity to compare shots from the day, perhaps a few days later to give the film freaks time to get stuff processed.

Before you all start shouting ""impossible"", please be aware that I have had to deal with VNPT for the past year and was highly relieved to have another option - hence FPT now supply my ADSL connection. In my opinion, it is faster and I can call up technical support and 3 out of the 4 times I have called they speak better English than my Vietnamese - AND they solved the problems I had. Firstly, I configured my own router and had NAT disabled - over the phone they gave me the solution - it was fun and we got there in the end. Then came a change of router - if you do this mid contract then you will have to call them so they can reset something on their end - then came a complete disconnection from the pole ( I called at 11.30pm so could not get anyone who spoke English. I called back on Sunday morning and the guy said he would send someone. They did send someone first thing on Monday morning who actually telephoned me to check if my connection was good. It was!!!! I was more than impressed.  Not sure what the previous post was about but I can safely say that FPT have been nothing but expedient with my problems and perhaps Kurtz was confused with VNPT. VNPT really need to get their bloody act together and sort out their connection speeds, responsiveness and overall level of service.                       Was this review ...

Three stars for the fun activities they have around for us... I especially had fun with my friends at the ""haunted"" house and the mirror house. The brigde in the middle of the glass house was really shaggadellic!! It reminded me of AUstin powers and i almost break out into THE austin Dance.. *music playing in my head now.. Yup it was fun! Im an addict with those game machine that hooks up stuff toys back at home and i was happy that they have it there but the stuffed toys looked looked like they have been there for centuries. Then there is the HUGE transparent ball that 2 grown adults can be dumped in it, on the lake itself. I had to try that and i went in with my close friend whom had difficulty even standing because i was like a hamster running in the ball but she on the other hand was rolling in the ball. A must try... Hilarious, if you are not the one rolling, that is....    Now, the animals, where do i start?? The animals there are fed with junks and no one actually bothered to stop. People throwing sticks and stones and everyone else are laughing. Empty canned drinks are thrown in the cages. It was just so sad looking at the animal being treated they way they are. I can try to stop but its just one day, tomorrow it will be back to the usual throw stones and laugh at them all. I am extremely appalled by the behaviour of people there.     The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated    Mahatma Gandhi     im no saint but there is truth in this saying, i believe.

Executive Stylist, Australian Cat Cenere works from a 3rd floor studio in the ""Hidden Hanoi"" building on Nghi Tam. Cat was trained in Australia and has many years experience in styling and colour. She opened Hairspace during 2008. Visiting HairSpace is a relaxing affair, with real coffee, comfortable chairs, recent fashion magazines, in a quiet airconditioned room.  It is easy to discuss with Cat how you would like your hair styled, and talk about the alternatives for colouring.  Since opening many expat women have been thrilled to find the hairdresser they had been hoping for.I have now seen many friends who have had gorgeous modern cuts/colour from Cat, and each time I visit I also receive plenty of compliments about the outcome!    As there is just Cat and her assistant in the Salon, appointment times are limited - so it is very important to book ahead, or risk disappointment.(Update - Australian Stylist Maria Russo will also be working at Hairspace from mid January 09)    The fee would not be considered cheap by vietnamese standards, however justified by the reliably fabulous results.

I am an animal person... anything that has to do with it, i'll be there in an instance. this was a find that i was very proud of! People whom i know, they all have no clue that there is a circus here in town! ]    I was walking towards the French Hospital to see the ""animal market"" along the main road,(beside the railway)when i stumbled upon the circus which is beside the Lenin Park.They actually sell rabbits, fishes and birds on bicycles.. how weird is that?     Back to the main focus, the circus was bundle of fun although it was narrated in Vietnamese the whole time. even the clowns spoke vietnamese but the act was rather universal so i was laughing throughout, okay im lying.. sometimes it can get corny! but it was a very good effort.    The was the trapeze act which i really enjoyed. all of them in superhero like costumes which was hilaroius but the act was impeccable! Excellent! All those turning in the air and looping.. impressive...     Cant really say i enjoyed equally for the animal acts though. it was obvious that they used fear to trained the animals. The monkeys for one, were all running away hysterically from the trainer during the act where they had to ride around in bicycles.The elephant came out with this Vietnamese guy smiling at the audience but when there is a need for the elephant to do a trick, he will be stern and pierce his cane that has a nail attached at the tip of it, at the poor elephant. It was painful to watch. Thank god it was a short one. Then there were the dogs which were badly groomed, i dont think they are groomed at all! Hopefully, behind the scene they will show much more concern towards the animals.    The circus only runs on friday night, saturday morning and sunday mornings. and i paid 30,000vnd for Sunday morning show.     There are actually quite a number of good acts. Make yourself free on one of these days, go down and watch for yourself.                         Was this review ...

In addition to hanoimonkey's great outline I find this an easy place to shop as the prices are not also reasonable but also fixed-so no bargaining is necessary to feel like you have a fair price.  I always bring my visitors to Craft Link.  These shops have clearly benefited from some training in how to display as they show off their products really well eg. they display small ""colour stories"" - group products togther in colour schemes which looks fresh and is effective in the small space.  This helps them stand out from other shops with assorted crafts.  Also  - I have purchased quite a few water puppets here.  - The assistants usually speak enough English for most transactions.  - HIWC members can get a discount off purchases.

No doubt why the Korean BBQ chicken across the street is so empty. Bad location.     We have a idiom "" khut mt trng coi"" which is something like you don't have to care because it's out of sight. It is not only the case of BBQ chicken but of many other pavement food stalls, so you ignore how the food is made and just enjoy it. If you keep thinking and imagining how dirty it is, sure you'll hate the place.    We always go there in a big group cus it's a lot of fun.I had the chance to taste not only chicken, ribs, bread, potatoes but also coal(or not) >.<    I'm still trying to figure out the recipe.

Thu Huong Bakery is always full of people, specially on holidays, the staff have to carry the cakes on their heads to get through the crowd.    Actually, I don't go there for the cakes much but for the pate. At 4oclock every afternoon, they bring out the pate and it is sold out really quick. Some retailers even go there to buy and resell them somewhere else. It costs 35k in Thu Huong and 50k in Giang Vo. I live near Giang Vo but I prefer to go all the way to Phan Dinh Phung street because I can always buy myself a bunch of cookies n cheesecakes and if the owner is there, she always offer some exclusive discount.     ^^                       Was this review ...

Currently you will find product review forms at the bottom of individual product pages in the  Grocery  and  Body Care  sections.  Just browse through our online products as you normally would, and when you come across a product you have tried before you can post your product review.  Product reviews include giving the item an overall rating on a scale from 1-to-5 (the higher the better), as well as expressing your experience with the product in a couple of sentences.       We are looking for product reviews that help other customers make informed purchasing decisions.  Share your knowledge! Of course everyone is a little different, so your experiences with these products may vary compared to other consumers.  Please note that the opinions expressed in any product review are not those of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, and only represent the opinion of the individual reviewer.       We love hearing about the products that our customers love and would recommend to others, but reviews do not have to be positive to be approved as helpful. Critical responses can also be very useful to purchasing decisions.     To have your post approved for credit, please make sure that you are reviewing the actual product and not commenting about NaturalGrocers.com or other matters.     Reviews should be your unique experience with the product and original content. Repeating the same review over and over will not be approved for credit, nor will automated submissions.     Brief reviews may be accepted in some cases so long as it is a meaningful contribution, but reviews with apparently little thought put into them will not be credited -- and especially in cases where many products reviewed by the same account with similar quick responses.     We encourage participation and feedback, but please be courteous to other visitors.     Spamming will not be allowed and members posting unsolicited advertising, unrelated content, or offensive material may be banned. As all reviews are approved before shown publically, spamming efforts are wasted.     The IP address of all posts is recorded to aid in enforcing these conditions.     We will not be held liable for any errors or omissions in any postings or for any loss or damages of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any information contained in customer submitted reviews.     Submitted product reviews may be edited before being posted online for various reasons (length, spelling, grammar, appropriateness, etc.)     All decisions on approving product reviews for store credit are final and solely at the discretion of NaturalGrocers.com.  Accumulated store credit balances are ONLY applicable to purchases using NaturalGrocers.com and cannot be used in our retail store locations or other sites.  This is an experimental program and the terms are subject to change at any time. Review approval may take up to 48 hours but usually approved much faster during regular business hours. Store credit balances will be maintained so long as the program remains in operation.  Earned store credit will automatically be applied to an online order at NaturalGrocers.com (minimum $25 order) and subtracted from the product subtotal on the confirmation page.

As of April 2008 Tom is going to be supplying us with our larger ‘bacon’ pigs which will make the boxes 100% organic. He has established a 100 sow herd of DurocXLandrac gilts which he is crossing with HampshireXDuroc boars which should be ideal for our sausages, bacon and ham. Tom’s family have farmed at Smallbrook Farm for generations but things went a little wrong when they went intensive with their pigs and chickens. They got screwed by the ‘cheap food’ myth which seduced so many farmers during the 70s and 80s. Situated in an area of incredibly free draining sandy loam, just north of Exeter, they couldn’t be in a better position for outdoor pig production. Looking after the pigs on a day to day basis is Nick who has been a pig man for thirty five years and ""never not wanted to go to work"".                             We have agreed a price structure based on feed costs so, providing he looks after his pigs properly, his fortunes shouldn’t depend on the fickle nature of the market.

Most CSAs offer shareholders a basket every week of the veggies and herbs that are in season on the farm. Shares vary from farm to farm, sometimes even including eggs, cheeses, flowers, and meat. Some CSAs even offer shares that go through the winter months. Becoming a member of a CSA allows you to know you’re eating fresh, local food and to meet the farm and people who grow your food! You also get the satisfaction of supporting local agriculture: the prepaid CSA arrangements are a source of financial security for Vermont’s farmer. CSAs have been very popular recently. Be sure to sign up early (typically in the early spring) before subscriptions are filled!

clueweb09-en0008-76-23060	"                    Down on the Farm                       Inlive           AFC          Here are suggested books and website links, along with songs, poems, and activities I've used in my classroom.  Feel free to use anything you find on this page in your own class, and please be sure to put the author's name on any poems or songs that you reproduce.  If you have any terrific songs, poems, or website links, send them to me at  kinderkorner@aol.com  and I'll add them.     First time here?  Here's how it works ...   Click on the title or picture for more information or to order from Amazon.com, then use the BACK button on your browser to return here to see more titles.  All books will be added to your Amazon.com shopping cart and saved there until you are ready to complete your order.     Down on the Farm    I usually do a Farm unit during the month of September, which is when the Kern   County Fair comes to town for 3 weeks.  My students always love taking a field trip to see and touch the animals.  Although Bakersfield is still an agricultural community, many of my students live in apartments or suburban houses, and have never seen anything from the local farms up close.  They're fascinated by the many fruits and vegetables on display, especially the huge ones, and get very excited to learn that so many foods are grown here, along with cotton.   A local source for great information is the  Kern County Farm Bureau , a chapter of the American Farm Bureau Federation.  They sponsor Farm Day in the City for students, and Teacher's Agriculture Seminars and workshops in the summer, with tons of free materials.  Their website has a  Directory of Agriculture Related Websites , many offering freebies for teachers.  You probably have something similar in your area, so be sure to check around.  These associations are always happy to send a free speaker to your classroom, often with farm animals and/or equipment to show to the kids.   Many teachers integrate their unit on plants and gardens into their farm theme, as they work well together.  I prefer to teach the Farm in the Fall, and do a gardening unit in the Spring, after we return from our break.  If you'd like some fun ideas for your plants and gardening unit, be sure to visit my page called  Come Into Our Garden .  It's still under construction, but will be ready soon.     Have fun on the farm!        Take Me Out to the Barnyard   (tune:  Take Me Out to the Ballgame)   by Judy Hall   Take me out to the barnyard.   Take me out there right now.   Show me the cows, pigs and horses, too.   I hear an oink and a neigh and a moo.   There are chickens laying their eggs.   If they don't lay it's a shame.   Oh, it's one, two, three eggs today,   And I'm glad I came.     Farm Sounds   (tune:  Wheels on the Bus)   By John Saltsman   The cows in the barn go moo, moo, moo,   Moo, moo, moo -- moo, moo, moo.   The cows in the barn go moo, moo, moo,   All around the farm.   Other verses:   ... pigs in the pen go oink, oink, oink   ... hens in the coop go cluck, cluck, cluck   ... rooster on the fence goes cock-a-doodle-do   ... ducks in the pond go quack, quack, quack   ... lambs on the hill go baa, baa, baa   ... bunnies in the hutch go (silently wiggle nose with finger)     Pocket Chart Activities      As everyone knows, I LOVE pocket charts and have 6 to 10 going at any   given time in my classroom.  Don't forget to visit my  Pocket Charts Page  when you've finished exploring the farm.  Many of our pocket chart poems are made into class Big Books. I usually make copies of each pocket chart poem for my student's poetry journals, and also write them on a half sheet of poster board to put in my Song & Poetry Center, so the children have MANY opportunities to interact with the text.  All of my students love to read our farm unit poems.   Because I do my farm unit at the beginning of the year, when the students are learning to read each others' names, I do a lot of name poem innovations, many of which are below.  Here are just a few of the  things I do with pocket charts during our Down on the Farm theme:      Who Lives On a Farm?   By Victoria Smith   I use Ellison die cuts for the animals and for the word ""farm"" in this activity.   The farm is represented by a red barn.  I also make individual student books   of this story, from sentence strips with the shapes glued on.  This is an outstanding   activity for teaching children tracking and one-to-one correspondance.   Make the following sentence on a sentence strip, leaving a space to place an animal die cut,   and room for the red barn at the end.  I make a matching set of strips and cut them apart,   so my students can match text in the pocket chart, or take words to their desks for writing.   A _____ lives on a (barn diecut goes here).   animals I use include pig, cow, lamb, horse, dog, cat, mouse,   duck, hen, rooster, rabbit, frog, and fish     The Giving Farm   By Vicki Witcher   Hens give eggs.   Pigs give ham.   Cows give milk.   Strawberries give jam.   Bees give honey.   Goats give cheese.   Farms give food,   I'd like some, please.     Good Morning Farm Song   Good morning to the rooster,   Good morning to the cows,   Good morning to the piggies in the pen.   Good morning to the sheep,   Good morning to the horses,   Good morning to the farmer and the hens.   Here's the tune, for those of you who can make music ...   C FFFFFF   C FFFFF   C FFFFFCDD#E   C EEEEE   C EEEEEE   C FFFFFFFFF   It's not perfect, but it's close.  Try it and then do it your way :)     Nursery Rhyme Innovations   Kids love putting their names -- and each others' -- in the pocket chart.   Write each student's name on 1 or 2 cards for these activities,   and also have both ""his"" and ""her"" cards available.      ( Child's name ) has lost her/his sheep   And doesn't know where to find them.   Just leave them alone   And they will come home,   Dragging their tails behind them.      ( Child's name ) had a little lamb,   Little lamb,   Little lamb,   ( Child's name ) had a little lamb,   Its fleece was white as snow.      ( Child's name )( Child's name ) quite contrary   How does your garden grow?   With silver bells and cockled shells   And little maids all in a row.      Round and round the haystack   Went ( Child's name ) the mouse.   One step,   Two steps,   In his/her little house.      I also use  One, Two, Buckle My Shoe   in the pocket chart during the farm unit.   It helps my students learn to read number words,   and it even has a big fat hen in it!     Creative Teaching Press and Scholastic both have wonderful,   ready-made interactive pocket chart sets with farm and animal themes.   You can find them at your local teacher supply store,   and you can also order Scholastic's pocket chart sets from Amazon.com ...   just click on the links below:      Interactive Farm Animals Pocket Chart Set from Scholastic   Pumpkins Interactive Pocket Chart Set from Scholastic      And don't forget to make a pocket chart and big book innovation called   Red Barn, Red Barn, What Do You See?   using all the colors, animals, and foods from the farm!           Five Cows All Black and White   (Tune:  5 Little Speckled Frogs)   Five cows all black and white   Chewed their cud from day to night   So they could give milk sweet and pure.   Squirt! Squirt!   One left the barn one day   So she could find more hay   Then there were 4 cows all black and white.   Moo! Moo!        Ten Clean Squeaky Pigs   Ten pigs so squeaky clean   Cleanest pigs you've ever seen!   Wanted to go outside and play   Snort!  Snort!   One jumped into the mud   Landed with a great big THUD! (slap thighs)   Then there were nine clean squeaky pigs.   Oink!  Oink!           5 White and Fluffy Sheep   Five white and fluffy sheep   In the pasture fast asleep   Their wool kept them cozy all night long.   Snore!  Snore!   The farmed slipped away with one   And sheared the wool till he was done   Then there were 4 white fluffy sheep.   Baa!  Baa!   All three of these songs make terrific big books   with student made art!  Don't forget to   add the math sentences to each page,   i.e.,  5 - 1 = 4      * scroll down for more songs, poems, activities, and links *        My Favorite Farm Books   First, a few old favorites.  We ALWAYS start the farm with   Mrs. Wishy Washy , from The Wright Group.  The kids love the language,   and it's a great book for teaching CAP (Concepts About Print).  I have some   simple props so the kids can act out the story during Literacy Centers,   and I also have puppets and felt board figures for them to use.   Two other must-have books from The Wright Group are  Duck and Hen   and  The Little Yellow Chicken .   The Little Yellow Chicken  is   The Little Red Hen's Grandson, and of course his friends don't want to   help him give a party, they just want to come in and eat all the food.   When he calls his grandmother for advice, she says ""Don't let them in!""   The kids love it :)  We contrast this story with  The Little Red Hen ,   using Venn Diagrams, charts, and role playing.  I have about a dozen   different versions of  The Little Red Hen .       The Little Red Hen   hardcover edition, under $7     The Little Red Hen   paperback, Puffin Easy to Read Series   approx. $3     The Little Red Hen   Scholastic Easy to Read   under $3        We also enjoy the various versions of  Chicken Little ,   and it's a good Autumn book.  Here are a couple of our favorites:     Illustrated by Steven Kellog   under $4   Also available as a  book and tape set .     Illustrated by Laura Rader   hardcover, under $7   Be sure to check out  Little Chicken Chicken   a fun twist on Chicken Little   under $5        Another all-time favorite is  Old MacDonald Had a Farm.   Most of the children know the song, and we make up our own innovations.   I have over two dozen Old MacDonald books, all different.   The kids love to compare the stories, the language, and the pictures,   leading to natural discussions about art and illustrations.   Here are links to several available through Amazon.com:     Illustrated by Carol Jones   with special peep holes in the pages   under $5        Illustrated by Rosemary Wells   a wonderful board book for small hands   under $4      Jane Yolen's Old Mac Donald Songbook   Yolen delivers a lively collection of 43 songs featuring animals from the farm.   A combination of the fantastic and the real, the barnyard creatures dance across pages decorated with patterned borders.  A must-have book for teachers!        Illustrated by Jessica Souhami   a gorgeous lift the flap book!   30% off        Illustrated by Pam Adams   one of my students' favorite books   with cut outs on each page   also check out her version of   There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly              Old MacDonald Had an Apartment House   Old MacDonald had a farm in an apartment house in the middle of the city.   As the tenants move out, Old MacDonald--the building's Super--moves vegetables and farm animals into the empty rooms. The farm grows by bushels and everything is fine-- until the day the owner comes by to collect the rent.     Alphabet Farm Song   (Tune:  Old MacDonald Had a Farm)   Mrs. _______ had a farm   A  B  C  D  E   Letters, letters in the hay   F  G  H  I  J   With a K  L  M,  N  O  P   Pigs and ducks and bumblebees..   Q  R  S  T  U  and  V   W  X  Y  Z        We always enjoy singing  Down on Grandpa's Farm .  I have it in the   pocket chart, with clip art pictures and matching text,   and also make a simple big book that is nothing more than colored   Ellison diecut animals, one per page.  The kids turn the pages and sing   about the animal, while learning their colors ... for example,   Down on Grandpa's farm there is a yellow duck ...   This is a year-round favorite with my kinderkids and first graders.     More Favorite Farm Stories        On Grandpa's Farm, by Vivian Sathre   A beautiful story filled with wonderful language.        Farming, by Gail Gibbons   a great introduction to the farm           Rosie's Walk, by Pat Hutchins   teaches prepositions ... over, under, around, etc.   choose from  paperback  or  hardcover   both under $5        Rooster's Off to See the World, by Eric Carle   a great introduction to simple addition, subtraction,  and sets   hardcover, approx. $4        Wake Up, Sun!

Collect small babyfood jars, fill them halfway with heavy cream   (also called whipping cream), then shake and roll them till   the butter thickens.  Here's a fun chant, that can also   be sung to the tune of Twinkle, Twinkle:   Making Butter Boogie   Shake it up   Shake it down   Shake it, shake it all around.   Shake it high   Shake it low   Shake it, shake it to and fro.   Shake it over   Shake it under   Pretty soon, you'll have butter!      I bring in my bread machine and bake bread   the same day we make butter.  Measuring ingredients   is a good math lesson and a great hands-on activity for the kids.   Borrow extra bread machines if you can.        Hooray for Farming! Series   beautiful books with full color photos!   Hooray for Dairy Farming!   Hooray for Sheep Farming!   Hooray for Orchards!
