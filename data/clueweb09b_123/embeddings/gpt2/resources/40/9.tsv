Posted 1 week ago  #                                   The Other Parker       Member                      One of the things I love about music is that, like language, it evolves. I think it's a bit simplistic to think one person or group is ""responsible"" for the ""invention"" of rap music. Different aspects of it have been influenced by the amalgamation of different cultures of the world.   Scottish flyting evolved into rap battles? Maybe. A little web searching suggests influences as varied as Arabic naqa'id, Lebanese zajal, the Norse poem  Lokasenna , and Japanese Haikai.   Rap beats themselves are more obviously derivative from the jazz/funk scene, which in turn derived from African slave spirituals and tribal dances before theat.   And breakdancing battles may have their roots in  Russian folk dances ! Or in the tribal cultures of Africa (like  these traditional Nigerian dances ).   The most interesting thing to me is that there's really nothing new under the sun. Similar things came about in cultures far removed from one another. These are just Things People Do, and while they do evolve over time they're never completely original. Our ancestors have been doing similar things all through history and all over the world.

In episode one, Michaels does his usual bit: snaps photos of the ladies, then watches them drink and fight. Though one of his delicate flowers takes a test-tube shot where no test-tube shot has ever gone before. …   (more…)          Caryn Ganz          Comments (28) Link to this   E-Mail     More  Rock Reality Show Recaps ,   ""Rock of Love""                   Sebastian Bach, Jermaine Jackson to Compete for Nashville Fame on “Gone Country 2″      8/7/08, 10:35 am EST        Next week marks a very special occasion for us at Rock Daily: the season premiere of CMT’s  Gone Country 2 . On the reality series,  John McCain fan  John Rich of Big & Rich invites a bunch of very non-country B-list celebrities to his Nashville mansion to try and convert them into marketable country stars. Last season ended with  Julio Iglesias Jr.’s stunning victory  over favorites Bobby Brown and  American Idol ’s Diana DeGarmo. Leading the charge for this season’s cast is Sebastian Bach, who crossed genres brilliantly on MTV’s  Celebrity Rap Superstar  and stands as the early favorite. Also ready to rock a cowboy hat are Chris Kirkpatrick of ‘NSYNC (and VH1’s  Man Band ), Jermaine Jackson and this season’s prerequisite  American Idol  reject, Mikalah Gordon. Rounding out the cast is actors Lorenzo Lamas (who you’ll recognize from those terrible action movies HBO airs at roughly 3:15 in the morning) and recently rehabbed Sean Young of  Blade Runner  and  Ace Ventura  “Finkle is Einhorn” fame. The season two premiere will air next Friday, August 15th, at 8 pm.

For their final test, the girls had to write an original song to be performed with L.A.’s coulda-been Dap-Tones, Breakestra. Byata came a little granola, telling a backpacker-friendly story about the path to her hip-hop greatness. Celebrity judge  Missy Elliott  asked fellow judge Mona Scott (an industry vet) if she could even remember the hook and eventually came up blank. The usually fierce Rece Steele didn’t disappoint, running around the stage and coming so hard that even challenger Byata was singing along — eventually taking the $100,000, the title of Miss Rap Supreme, a week of MySpace hits and, most importantly, the honor of being serenaded by Kool Keith!

A Supreme Hour In Three Sentences:  After shooting some targets at the Los Angeles Gun Club (Ms. Cherry — out on bond — had to sit this one out), the girls spit a 16-bar verse about bringing peace to the streets. Byata totally blanked (”uh huh. yeah. we gotta do it for the children”), Ms. Cherry stumbled on her words and Rece Steel stared at her feet. Chiba was the only femcee that brought it, so of course now was the perfect time for everyone to jump down her throat at her about using pre-writtens.   (more…)          Christopher R.

Serch made everyone show off their hidden talents — though Nicky2States’ pathetic hula-hooping and Chiba’s abortive double-dutching assured whatever talent they had remained hidden. Finally, with the help of Just Blaze, the teams had to make a clean hip-pop song for the radio — promptly judged, live on the air, at L.A. hip-hop station KDAY. Byata led her team to victory for a third time, but if anything was ultimately decided, it’s that a Just Blaze beat can make anyone sound dope.   (more…)          Christopher R.

So what happened? David Archuleta’s  right hand reached out even more than usual  (perhaps he was grasping for his  backstage-banned dad ?), David Cook brought the big notes (and some  Switchfoot  love) and the judges told Syesha Mercado she was beautiful but sucked (in almost as many words). Here’s what you may have missed, in five quick clips:   5. Archuleta tries to sass it up and dance to a  Chris Brown  song. We have never missed Danny Noriega more.

Rock Daily sorts through the nepotistic wreckage.   Children’s Story:  We finally arrive at our last live episode, which opens in rapid fire fashion with Crosby Loggins shrugging his way through the Raconteurs’ “Steady As She Goes,” Chloe Lattanzi getting all twitchy on “Should I Stay or Should I Go” and Jesse Blaze Snider shouting along with Good Charlotte’s “The Anthem.” It only went downhill from there, as there were conversations with the rejects, collaborations with parents and an endless barrage of flashback montages for things that happened a mere five weeks ago.    Baby Geniuses:  While Jesse Snider was performing “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” the only thing the audience could be thinking was, “This is fine, but I would prefer if Dee was here.” And then he showed up!

Literally. From Syesha Mercado’s teary make-up-running interview to Jason Castro’s dreads a’flyin’ rendition of “I Shot the Sheriff,” nearly everything about last night’s homage to the 500 songs that shaped rock (as deemed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) was in poor taste — special props to Paula Abdul for this gem: “I think your ‘Hungry Like the Wolf’ has left me with a big appetite.” For the night’s best moments, watch these quick clips:   5. Is Jason Castro trying to tell us something? Read his lips: “Don’t vote.” Or was that “Don’t toke”? Either way kids, this man is a walking lesson.

A Supreme Hour In Four Sentences:  Director John Singleton stops by for “Hip-Hop Hamlet” if only to help us all cringe at what a stupid exercise this is — “Whether ’tis nobler in the domepiece to suffer the ballin’ and fallin’ of some outrageous fortune.” Cherry brags that she’s in three upcoming films and then blows it. Once split into teams, the girls worked out a dance routine at the famous Lulu Washington Dance Theatre. Team Lady Twist lost since the heavyset Twist was out of breath, the scrappy Bree was a showboater, but everyone learned their hot new dance that evokes images of fun things like sweeping the floor.

Rock Daily sorts through the nepotistic wreckage.   Children’s Story:  After getting record scores last week, Crosby Loggins doled out some dull trash talk about getting an automatic bye to the finale next week. This frustrated both Jesse Snider and Lucy Walsh, despite the fact that both seemed pretty confident they were also in the clear. Lara Johnston and Chloe Lattanzi panicked, probably because they weren’t very good. In the performance portion of the show, each remaining hopeful got to sing two songs, save for the two who were eliminated. Lara Johnston was sent packing, and in what could be considered a minor upset, Lucy Walsh was also shown the door. There were no tears in either of their exits; they probably remembered that even though they lost, they’re still both rich and able to score record deals.    Baby Geniuses:  In a week where everybody stunk, the highlights were few and far between.

David Archuleta pulled the Kristy Lee Cook card and performed “America,” Ryan Seacrest creepily played with a kid in the audience’s hair before Syesha Mercado’s second song and something happened in Paula Abdul’s mind that cannot be explained by simple science. For those moments and more, check out these quick clips:   5. Due to a tear in the space-time contiuum, Paula Abdul actually did see Jason Castro perform twice (her analysis of his phantom second song was  dead on , folks!).

A Supreme Hour In Three Sentences:   Too $hort  will be the first to tell you (over and over again… over the course of twenty-five years) that he truly knows the inner workings of women. So the ladies had to respond to his sixteen bars, or as Lady Twist put it: “Now is the time to get vulgar and ignorant.” Then  Ghostface Killah  showed up and hung with the spazzin’-out ladies for no particular reason — but who are we to complain about a Ghostface cameo?

Rock Daily sorts through the nepotistic wreckage.   Children’s Story:  Dull non-controversy continued in the Cradle Lounge this week, as Jesse Blaze Snider said something vaguely opinionated and everybody flipped out. Nobody flipped out better than  Bobby Brown , however, who was irate that his son Landon earned such low scores for his performance of “My Prerogative” last week. As for the show, the viewers said goodbye to both Lil B. Sure and Landon Brown, which prompted Bobby Brown to announce “We’re all going on tour”; the prospect of a show that included sets from Landon & Bobby Brown and Lil & Al B. Sure gives Rock Daily night terrors.    Baby Geniuses:  Jesse Snider continues to rule this show; his version of  Johnny Cash ’s “Ring of Fire” was uniformly excellent despite some middling scores from the judges.

Ryan Seacrest made a buffoon of himself (seriously, is this getting worse each week or what?), Syesha Mercado prepared for her future Broadway career, Brooke White goofed and started her song again, and Sir Webber had a grand chuckle over boys singing songs written for girls — let’s forgive him, he’s British. For the night’s best moments, watch these quick clips:   5. Lloyd Webber never thought he’d see a man with dreadlocks sing “Memory”?

A Supreme Hour In Four Sentences:  Veteran Khia demanded respect last week, even going so far as rhyming respect me with respect me a dozen times and calling it her sixteen-bar challenge. Whatever respect she gained was lost a mere three minutes into this episode when the  Miss Rap Supreme  staff discovered her entire challenge verse was lifted from Respect Me (of course), a song from her 2006 album  Gangstress . So German reim-spitter Lionezz got a second chance and the nine remaining femcees entered the So Seductive Rap Challenge, rhyming about whats personally seductive and alluring to you (something co-host Yo-Yo did just fine without ever doing) in front of the ladies at the Moonshadow lesbian bar. We barely noticed the change in scenery since theres already so much gratuitous kissing on this show.   (more…)          Christopher R.

Send To Friend   |                      Live Review: Lil Wayne, T-Pain, Keyshia Cole - Universal Amphitheatre, Los Angeles  Who is hip hop's king of the hill? Is it the man with the hottest hooks or the man with the most raucous raps? Is it  T-Pain  or  Lil Wayne ?   Both names are so ubiquitous in pop and rap right now that a tour together was a no-brainer. In fact, the  I Am Music  tour might as well be  Tyson/Holyfield  for Facebook nation, since there's just as much fanfare surrounding it. When both men hit the stage together at the sold out Gibson Amphitheatre last night, it was as explosive as any big prizefight, well, minus the blood.  T-Pain hit the stage before Weezy, and he brought the whole circus along for the ride, literally. His setup featured a big tent, an old school organ and an elevated DJ booth. The stage became the ringleader's playground. He churned out hit after hit, blazing through nearly every song he's had a hook on since 2007. Those spanned the entire Billboard Top 100 chartfrom ""Low"" and ""The Boss"" to ""The Good Life"" and ""Kiss, Kiss."" However, the hits weren't even the best part of the show. He brandished a bazooka and led camo-clad dreadlocked midgets into battle, as they danced in sync with the DJ's beats. ""Mini  Britney Spears "" even made an appearance, because T-Pain ""Couldn't afford the whole Britney.""  For many other performers, the midgets might've stolen the show. That wasn't the case here though. T-Pain truly stood out on cuts from his latest full-length  Three Ringz , including ""Can't Believe It"" and ""Chopped and Skrewed."" The two psychedelic hip hop tracks fit right in with the big top aesthetic, and they solidified T-Pain as the ringleader of this circus.  Then there was Lil Wayne. He's proclaimed himself the best over and over again, and he certainly does command a crowd. His band stood elevated on separate metallic platforms suspended by chains from the ceiling. Their playing gave the songs a vibrant, live panache. ""Mr. Carter"" certainly was the perfect opener as Wayne announced his arrival. A winding riff launched a raw ""Got Money."" T-Pain took to the stage on a motorized two-wheel scooter, and he and Weezy knocked out verse after verse and hook after hook. Their time together definitely was the most memorable moment of the show, and the bevy of chart-toppers illustrated just how prominent both men are.  After T-Pain bounced, Wayne ripped through the phenomenal mixtape cut ""Ride 4 My ******"" and dropped some science on ""Dr. Carter."" Meanwhile, he picked up a shiny guitar for ""Prostitute,"" before putting on his war face again for ""I'm Me.""  Keri Hilson  came out for her latest Weezy fueled hit ""Turnin' Me On,"" and it was equally as bootylicious as ""Mrs. Officer"" was. ""Comfortable"" showed the softer side of Wayne, while ""Duffle Bag Boy"" was as hood as it got, propelled by a massive guitar solo. Weezy had no shortage of hits, and he fired each one off successfully.  Supporting her latest offering  A Different Me ,  Keyshia Cole 's set was equally bombastic. She imbued a natural prowess into ""Shoulda Let You,"" ""Let It Go"" and ""I Changed My Mind."" Dressed like a classy showgirl, she nailed the dance numbers, and her voice soared from the stage to the back of the amphitheatre. She blended a soulful sense of class with a hip hop edge for an R&B concoction that was undeniable live. With a knockout ""Playa Cardz Right,"" Keyshia proved her mettle on the stacked bill. Ms. Cole certainly was the night's biggest and most pleasant surprise.  Before Keyshia, Gym Class Heroes threw down in energetic alterna hip hop fashion, shimmying through a short but sweet set that included ""Cookie Jar,"" ""Guilty as Charged"" and ""Cupid's Chokehold."" They also brought their A-Game, playing tightly and tenaciously to keep the discerning fans' attention.  So at the end of the day, after such a diverse and dynamic road show, was it clear who stood as king of the hill? Not really, but democracy's still an option for hip hop, and there are even enough talented representatives to make it work. Rick Florino 12.22.08          More ARTISTdirect News      Slipknot, Paramore Among Artists On Valentine's Day Comp Wed, 07 Jan 2009 17:05:51    Meg & Dia Make a Run For the Road Wed, 07 Jan 2009 16:55:00    Major Philip Glass, John Cage Supporter Dies Wed, 07 Jan 2009 16:44:22    50 Cent Unveils Tracklist For New LP Wed, 07 Jan 2009 15:56:10    Monsters Vs.

Barclay                   S.O.B.'s, New York, NY July 23, 2008 It was a night that true lovers  of R&B and Soul can attest to, as Anthony David performed for New York City. The vibes that came across the crowd as they  listened to the poignant feel-good tracks songwriter turned artist David  delivered from his latest release  Acey Duecy  (Soulbird/Universal  Republic), were definitely felt throughout the semi-packed venue.       Newcomer Vincent V. Rich  Richardson warmed up the scattered crowd, performing several original  songs for the audience. However, it was pretty clear that they were awaiting David, whose album  is a compilation of songs from his debut  3 Chords & The Truth   and second album  The Red Clay Chronicles  (both released under  Brash Music).      As soon as David hit the stage,  everyone from the bar and those seated eating dinner all flocked to  center stage. He opened introducing himself and his album singing over  Estelles American Boy, and then transitioned into tracks from  his third release. Most of the audience has followed him from his very  beginnings, while others only heard his name from penning hits for India.Arie.     Mellow cuts like Something  About You,"" Stop Playin and the very relevant Krooked  Kop got the crowd of mostly women warmed up. His very easy-going  demeanor along with his gray jeans, black and white plaid shirt, and  nose ring helped his devoted fans relax and settle into the performance  backed by a live band. When Cheatin Man and Cold Turkey  were performed, everyone in the crowd sung each and every word to the  song carried by the heavy sounds of the electric and bass guitars. He  then performed Part Of My Life, which he co-wrote for India.Aries   Acoustic Soul  album.      He switched things up a bit  by performing Guys I Like and Mary J. Bliges My Life-  followed by his own Lady,"" Kinfolk and Smoke One.   The  ladies in the crowd rocked out to the up tempo GA Peach, and then  the band immediately left the stage leaving everyone a little dumbfounded. Fortunately, the band returned to give the show a proper close with the  Georgia natives first single, Words.     Anthony David is not necessarily  new to the music scene because of his songwriting repertoire. Although  many in the audience were not familiar with him as an artist, he certainly  left an impression that has stuck and will prove to continue the ongoing  appreciation of good R&B and Soul music.

Barclay                   S.O.B.'s, New York, NY July 23, 2008 It was a night that true lovers  of R&B and Soul can attest to, as Anthony David performed for New York City. The vibes that came across the crowd as they  listened to the poignant feel-good tracks songwriter turned artist David  delivered from his latest release  Acey Duecy  (Soulbird/Universal  Republic), were definitely felt throughout the semi-packed venue.       Newcomer Vincent V. Rich  Richardson warmed up the scattered crowd, performing several original  songs for the audience. However, it was pretty clear that they were awaiting David, whose album  is a compilation of songs from his debut  3 Chords & The Truth   and second album  The Red Clay Chronicles  (both released under  Brash Music).      As soon as David hit the stage,  everyone from the bar and those seated eating dinner all flocked to  center stage. He opened introducing himself and his album singing over  Estelles American Boy, and then transitioned into tracks from  his third release. Most of the audience has followed him from his very  beginnings, while others only heard his name from penning hits for India.Arie.     Mellow cuts like Something  About You,"" Stop Playin and the very relevant Krooked  Kop got the crowd of mostly women warmed up. His very easy-going  demeanor along with his gray jeans, black and white plaid shirt, and  nose ring helped his devoted fans relax and settle into the performance  backed by a live band. When Cheatin Man and Cold Turkey  were performed, everyone in the crowd sung each and every word to the  song carried by the heavy sounds of the electric and bass guitars. He  then performed Part Of My Life, which he co-wrote for India.Aries   Acoustic Soul  album.      He switched things up a bit  by performing Guys I Like and Mary J. Bliges My Life-  followed by his own Lady,"" Kinfolk and Smoke One.   The  ladies in the crowd rocked out to the up tempo GA Peach, and then  the band immediately left the stage leaving everyone a little dumbfounded. Fortunately, the band returned to give the show a proper close with the  Georgia natives first single, Words.     Anthony David is not necessarily  new to the music scene because of his songwriting repertoire. Although  many in the audience were not familiar with him as an artist, he certainly  left an impression that has stuck and will prove to continue the ongoing  appreciation of good R&B and Soul music.

It has been a while since I have posted anything on this-here blog. Busiest Summer of my life thus far.  The third season of my radio show Electro Pop Machin begins this week, Thursday at 8pm. I should be back doing my weekly reviews on CIBL 101,5 some time soon and therefore posting more on this website.  In the meantime, Plants and Animals, Le Citoyen and La Patre Rose are all upcoming on the show. Electro Pop Machin, Thursdays, 8pm on CIBL 101.5 fm in Montreal, or  http://www.cibl1015.com/ . Obviously it's a French radio station so I host in French, but I like the idea of writing here in English. It gets more people reading and discovering! And my grammar sucks in French! Check out the Facebook group as well since it will keep you updated on upcoming visitors on the show; one each week.    Have a great weekend, I know I will; It's my birthday on Saturday! Cheers!

I've had the opportunity to listen to the entirety of Ariane Moffatt's latest,  Tous les Sens . I am in love again. She has the astonishing confidence of reconstructing her visions to near-musical perfection. Her collaborators have a lot to do with this (Jean-Phi Goncalvez,  Alex MacMahon, Franck Dewaere, Franois Plante), but her pen is so accurate that no one is left indifferent to her emotions. When I first met her in 2003 for the release of  Aquanaute , she mentioned her struggle to search within her 'jardin secret'. That is exactly what she has managed to give her listener: a piece of her secret garden.  With  Tous les Sens , she moves with the music and revisits her distinctive sound. It's in stores this coming Tuesday, Earth Day. It is her most intrinsic and aesthetic album to date.

PDA is not Place des Arts, nor a Personal Digital Assistant, it's short for Public Display of Affection, musical duo formed of Imperial Teen frontman Will Schwartz and Tussel's  Tomo Yasuda. Bubblegum gum, simple synth-pop that kinda makes you wanna say: 'Please, give me something new!' And I've said it for every song of their Hey Willpower release. There is so much determination, want and need for pretty behind their music that I don't like it. BUT, I am going to give them a second chance since they are coming to Montreal with MEN (former Le Tigre Samson and Joanna) March 2nd  at Les Saints. If they toured with Montreal faves Lezzies on X, they've got to be worth while seeing on stage. Please, oh pretty please let it be so. I want to like you PDA, but there just seems to be so much doggedness behind your sound that it sickens me! Focus, and let go of the cheesy dancers! I can't believe Peaches rocked the shocker with Will! Gosh! Official Website MySpace P.S. Ok, Hundredaire turns me on!

The Trucks seem to have found out. I guess it would take a Cindy Lauper and The Bangles re-visitation through 'A Message' Come[ing] Back' to know what has been said before. Consider it done! I know, this sounds so far fetched that I have trouble believing it. Well hear it for yourself. It's as nasty as Peaches and as benevolent as...I don't know. It just seems all new to me! Love it to make my dog sick. The Trucks are Kristin, Marissa, Lindy and Faith and you are just beginning to hear about them.

I was checking out Ghislain Poirier's  MySpace  this morning only to discover this: ''Ghislain Poirier feat. Ariane Moffatt- Bientt. J'en dis pas plus.'' Niiiiice, been waiting for a collaboration like that to happen! Igloofest  is back to Quai Jacques Cartier for its second edition and obvisouly fat-boucing Ghis' will be there for the Ninja Tune evening (so will Spank Rock's Devlin and Darko, Daedelus and Ghostbeard).

Disco is back and Calvin Harris claims to have created it! humm, well he sure has redefined it. Calvin is from Dumphries, Scotland and is a whole-in-one with this album. Not a huge voice range  la Donna Summer, but a hell-of-a-lotta beats! He makes me get down and boogie woogie. His first attempt,  I created Disco , is entirely home made. The beats are groovy, colourful and just make you wanna dance; turbo-funkiness would wrap it up nice. 2008 is the year when disco revives in popularity and  I Created Disco  will definitely top my best of for 2008. With the full length just recently released in the UK, he is already  nominated for the US Shortlist Prize, the equivalent to the Mercury Music Prize which awards the best album of the UK. Past Shortlist winners include Cat Power, Sufjan Stevens and Damien Rice. With song titles like Colours, Neon Rocks, Vegas, Disco Heat, and Electro Man you know you'll blast in the past, sweat to 'future-disko' and look for your old Village People vinyls!

""Girlfriend"" by Avril Lavigne (all language versions)  any suggestions?                                                                                    2 comments                                               Tags:                        music ,           history ,           americana ,           america ,           playlist ,           american culture ,           esl ,           music culture ,           friendels                                                                           Next Posts                                                  omg.                            super spaz                            oh my goodness                                                 Previous Posts                                                  hapa hapa~                                                                                                                     Comments                                                                                                                                                            HapaLove  wrote:                                                                Sep 28, 2008                                         Reply                                                                                                                               [this is good]    I would say that you definitely have to include jazz and country, since they are distinctly American musical forms (even though jazz is made up of elements from Africa). For country, I would include Johnny Cash, maybe Hank Williams, and Dolly Parton. I know a lot of people swear off country, but when you hear Dolly's songwriting, it's like walking through the Tennessee mountains.   I'd also include Herbie Hancock, since he basically invented funk, which is too cool to leave out. :)   And finally, I think Aaron Copland is a must. Not just for his patriotic music, because he has some brilliant sort of avant-garde sounding compositions, too.

She Started playing with them in front of people since last year, her first album will be out this month.  Trampauline aims to make music that lights up people’s souls, combining thrills of electronic sound with sophisticatedly controlled acoustics. bringing out the sense of pure pop.   Trampauline sounds like:  heart -knocking tunes with simple beat. wearing an outfit of electronica but  if you look inside, you’ll see there’s definitely an acoustic spirit in it. a bit of noise, a bit of sunshine, might want to add some sound samples taken from my everyday life surroundings and companions. melancholia is another spice. ep based sweet pop songs and some instrumentals still with clear melodies all breathing in my works.

Lisa Rogers, 04.21.2006, 09:09 AM                 (EZ-Tracks) - Recently, Solange Knowles released a statement discounting rumors that she pregnant.  For those that don know, Solange Knowles is Beyonce Knowlesless famous baby sister.  The release of Solange press statement came as a surprise to the people that were not only unaware of her alleged pregnancy, but also that she even existed.    Not quite he sister in the basementSolange Knowles is no family secret, but she isn exactly Beyonce, either.  Some speculate that Solange may have created the pregnancy rumor, just so she would have a reason to issue a press release.     One would assume that evidence of this pregnancy rumor would be rampant on the internet, especially if stamping out the rumor warranted a press release; however, little research has revealed that the main evidence of there ever being a rumor was the fact that the press release was issued at all.                                                                                                                                                             Wow, Solange great job making yourself seem like elda,that creepy sister locked in the attic from Pet Cemetery.

LTD. announced today that they will partner to create a video game based on the music of the Beatles, slated for release before the end of 2009. Representatives from the three companies said that the game  which was conceived with input from  Paul McCartney ,  Ringo Starr ,  Yoko Ono  and Olivia Harrison  will aim to feature the entire Beatles catalog and will offer an experiential journey off the band. This is the first time the Beatles music has been presented in an interactive, video game format. This game will take you on a journey from the Beatles first album  Please Please Me  until the last album at  Abbey Road , said Apple Corps CEO Jeff Jones. It will span samples of the whole catalogue all the way through. The three companies would not clarify whether Beatles content would be available for  Rock Band  or whether the game would feature avatars of  John Lennon , Paul McCartney,  George Harrison  and Ringo Starr.  The project is a fun idea which broadens the appeal of the Beatles and their music, McCartney said in a statement. I like people having the opportunity to get to know the music from the inside out. The acquisition of the video game rights to the Beatles catalog is a major, scale-tipping coup for Harmonix and MTV Games as they fight for music video game dominance over the like-minded  Guitar Hero .

Stuart actually quit the Beatles in their Hamburg days to concentrate exclusively on his art. Stuart tragically passed away in 1962 at the age of 21.

We will have a beautifully framed copy of the Orbison stamp design at all our upcoming Rock Art Shows. We encourage our friends to enjoy the artistic beauty of the stamp and sign our petition to have this stamp issued by the Postal Service.

For the tepid Beastie fans, the art might leave you a bit perplexed, but each piece makes reference to some particular album, lyric or point in Beastie history, and it's just plain cool. There are 85 pieces in the show, all of them priced at $200 or less. A portion of the proceeds will go to a charity of the bands' choosing called The Gramercy Housing Project.   The exhibit premiered last night with flying colors and will continue on through January 29th for the public to enjoy, and has already gotten some major blog applauds. In order to prepare for this event, you might want to check out this  blog entry from Gallery 1988 , which shows artist Mark Brown's piece titled ""Egg Man's Journey (pictured),"" with a handy reference key so you can understand his numerous Beastie breadcrumbs.  This show is garnering major buzz, so check it out before Hypercolor tee-shirts go out of style. Speaking of which...   About Gallery 1988:  It's pretty simple. Under the ""About Us"" link on their website is a list of all things 1988, and the gallery folk give no other information about themselves. Some things are better left unexplained...
