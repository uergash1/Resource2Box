By  James Gray  on Tuesday, April 29th, 2008                  I find it fascinating that theres so little information available out there on the value of taxonomy as a founding principle in Web design strategy.   Taxonomy - the study of the general principles of scientific classification - has been around for hundreds of years. In Web work, its generally the organization of contexts into logical groupings and hierarchies.   Its those groupings that, in turn, help IAs determine navigation structures, metadata, even the very nomenclatures that are the foundation of Web usability best practices.   If youve ever been approached to help a client correct a truly horrific Web site, youve no doubt found that some (possibly much) of their pain points can be traced back to a poorly designed  or altogether missing  taxonomy.   Maybe its that those of us who build Web strategies have just come to see taxonomy as a given within the Information Architects toolset — something IAs employ but neednt share with the rest of the creative team or [forbid!] the client.   Maybe people think taxonomy is just an issue for larger, content rich  KM sites .   Maybe Im not finding a lot out there because whoever is writing tomes on taxonomy best practices just isnt remembering to add metadata to their articles.   Ok. That was a cheap shot. But where IS the supporting data in Taxonomys defense? Im disappointed by just how little taxonomy information is out there on the Web. Do a search on your own and youll see examples for Taxonomy best-practices and rationales are few and far between.   As a creative body, IAs all too often struggle with clients who just want to see the comps. Clients dont realize how much of their bottom line rides on the contextual storylines inherent in the usability of the site.   The process of taxonomy creation is really much easier and effective than the name might imply. Yet, Im amazed at how few IAs are given [or is it take?] the time to apply it. And Ive [almost] never seen nor heard of a client demand a content outline as a deliverable.   I recall a previous colleague who was asked to design wireframes as the initial deliverable for a large eCommerce client. He produced very innovative wires complete with auxiliary navigations, functional buttons, web 2.0 components& the whole nine yards. The client was delighted with the results. After all, they were the pre-cursors to some beautiful graphics.   The site, however, was completely useless. By not first establishing a contextual format for the linear plots and subplots of the user experience, the navigation buckets were little more than a sloppy hodgepodge of disparate functions and features. The sites organization lacked cohesion and the end users simply couldnt build a mental storyline around its intended purpose.   Thats why, whether creating a new site or performing an audit on an existing one, I find reviewing the sites taxonomics an invaluable starting point.   I begin with a literary outline based on the sites overarching goals. Sound too old school for todays hyper-connected world? Youd be amazed at how much mileage you can get by FIRST establishing the value of those straight pathways. It helps the client visualize those important subplots that will eventually become the sites use cases. It also points out where there are potential holes or disparages in the clients existing content sets and expectations. It also grounds them in reality that these areas of the site will need to be created AND maintained by someone in order to be successful.   More important, were helping rationalize and strengthen their business requirements  an important pre-visual practice  before  going to the expense of designing (and redesigning) wireframes or comps.   After all, isnt the role of a good taxonomy advisor to SAVE the client some money?                           3309                Posted in  User Experience ,   User-Generated Content ,   Usability ,   Research ,   Web Design  |    No Comments »                            Entrepreneurs shine in Emory University Event         By  Joe Koufman  on Monday, April 28th, 2008                  The Goizueta Business School of Emory University hosted a Spring 2008  Entrepreneurial Leadership Event  on Wednesday night, April 23, 2008that featured:     David Duncan, CEO of  Paddywax, Inc.  and President of  The Atlanta Chapter of the  Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO)   S. Dee Davis, CEO of  Digital Visual Display Technologies, Inc.   Mike Landman, Founder and CEO of  Ripple, Inc.   Jeff Hilimire, Co-Founder and President of  Engauge Digital  (formerly Spunlogic)     The event drew a large (100+) and diverse crowd of mostly students and entrepreneurs. When one panelist asked how many in the room were business owners, about half of the hands were raised. The dialogue was frank and providedinsights into the reasoning and drive that helped each entrepreneur endure the challenges that business owners face.   The best way to disseminate the information that the seasoned entrepreneurs shared is to list out some of my favorite highlights from the panel (paraphrased by me). David Duncan did a great job of moderating, so most of the answers did not come from him.   What is your best entrepreneurial advice?   Dee Davis:  You have to lead by example and take the pulse of the business frequently.   Mike Landman:  It is easy to take on more risk when you are young because you have less to risk.   Jeff Hilimire:  You have to be all in to start a business. There is no pressure for you to give the business a 100% chance when it is only a hobby.   How do you recommend building a team?   Dee Davis:  You need a relatively flat structure when the company is young.   Mike Landman:  We use a lot ofpre-hire testing and multiple interviews.   Jeff Hilimire:  Promoting from within is the best practice.   What is the best advice you have been given?   Dee Davis:  Energy and persistence conquer all things  Ben Franklin  Get out of your comfort zone!  Bob Parsons   Mike Landman:  Fight through the brick walls that are everywhere. - Randy Pausch (Carnegie Mellon Professor)   Jeff Hilimire:  Lead by exampleand Passion, Intelligence, andHard Work are the three most important traits of an entrepreneur.   What is the one thing that you wish you knew when you started your business?   Dee Davis:  I am not the smartest guy in the room, so try to fill the room with smart guys.   Mike Landman:  Marketing and managing cash flow.   Jeff Hilimire:  How to hire the right person.   What is your best marketing advice?   Dee Davis:  Think in different ways from your competitors. Get out there and meet people.   Mike Landman:  Pick a small enough niche to become an expert in that space.   Jeff Hilimire:  Become a thought leader and host private events that show off this leadership.   How do you go about finding the best sales person for your team?   Dee Davis:  Incent your sales people REALLY well. Some may make more than the CEO.   Mike Landman:  Be your companys best salesperson.   Jeff Hilimire:  Find someone with skills, but who you are alsoreally comfortable with, as they will be representing you!   Jeff also gave a plug to yours truly, which was an unexpected bonus…   Everyone who attended the event was highly engaged, and they seemed very appreciative of the wisdom that the panel imparted.

By  Jay Jhun  on Friday, April 25th, 2008                  As I was eating my spaghetti leftovers yesterday for lunch at my desk (sad, I know), I came across news that  Arby’s  is merging with  Wendy’s .   Suddenly a vision came to me and I thought I’d begin the process of voicing what awesome combinations of lunch could come forth from such a melding of quick service restaurant chains (this would make Arbys + Wendy’s into #3 behind the other two - you know who they are).   Combo #1 - Beef ‘n Cheddar + Vanilla Frosty     And for the marketing spin, how’s this for a new tagline: “I’m thinking this is WAAAAY better than McD and BK” (it’s awful, I know, but it’s all I could conjure up on leftover lunch).   Happy Lunch Hour to all - would love to hear other visions of combos.

It was done in Germany - which should be no surprise, this would never be passable in the US - to promotean action and suspense channel called “13th Street.”     I get the impression you either love or hate this idea. Obviously I think it’s awesome, and so does  Jeff Hilimire . But, one of my friends/coworkers pointed out that she would likely have a panic attack if she was exposed to this campaign unknowingly.   They placed a substance that would luminesce in black light on the walls, sink and mirror in anightclub bathroom in Hamburg. The manner it was applied mimicked that of a crime scene.   Then they timed the traditional lighting in the room to replace with blacklight after a subject entered the room; exposingthe “bloodbath” as well as the logo, tagline -  See What Others Don’t See  - and the web address of the television station .   Check out  more pictures here. Talk about thinking outside the box; this is experiential marketing at its best. Maybe not passable in the US, but it definitely makes you think about what’s possible.                                         Posted in  Creative  |    2 Comments »                            This early adopter has seen the future…         By  Jeff Hilimire  on Tuesday, April 15th, 2008                    Ok, so maybe that title is a little dramatic, but I still feel like Ive seen something that today is so foreign to most everyone but in 5 years will be completely commonplace.   For my recent birthday my mother, who I thought I had taught never to buy me any electronics for fear of reliving the Mapping Software incident of 2003, on her own judgment went and bought me the new Amazon Kindle.   The Kindle, if you arent up to speed on it, is Amazons answer to the digital book.  Instead of buying paper books, you download them to your Kindle and read them on the device.  It uses a new inking technology that basically makes the pages look as if they were printed in a book.  Heres a quick CNET video on it (or you can read a great  Newsweek article on the Kindle ):       I was pretty skeptical about it at first but having used this for a few days, it really is very easy to read on the device.  I subscribed to the Atlanta Journal & Constitution as well as the Wall Street Journal and both arrive on the Kindle before I wake up, and when I read them I dont get that ink all over my hands like you would with a newspaper.   Plus I can highlight sections on it, look up the definition of words (for the WSJ, Im not sure the AJC knows any big words) and save content for later.  Its been a blast using it so far.   So why do I think this is something that will be commonplace in a few years?  Think about going to the beach for a week and having to pack 2 or 3 books.  Think about kids in school having to carry big backpacks with all their books in them.  If there was a device that was easy to read on and easy to download books, why wouldnt we all shift over to this?   But the real reason I think this is the future is because of the greenness of it.  Think of all the trees that would be saved if we didnt have to print millions of books each year.   Once Al Gore gets behind this thing, itll be as popular as when he invented the Internet.                                         Posted in  Emerging Technology ,   Technology  2083  |    3 Comments »                            Will Starbucks Turn it Around?         By  Stephanie Critchfield  on Thursday, April 10th, 2008                  Bree posted a link to  Starbucks’ online coffee promotion  - free brew-at-home coffee samples with the completion of a little flavor preference quiz.   While I definitely appreciated the nifty interactive interface for this promotion (Bree called it brilliant - I mean, who doesn’t want free coffee?), it’s actually a symptom of a much larger problem at Starbucks.   A  BusinessWeek article  published yesterday stated “Starbucks ( SBUX ) stock dropped 42.8% in 2007 and is down 14.7% since the start of 2008.” That’s cause for concern.   A result, many consumers are beginning to witness a massive re-branding exercise, aimed at improving Starbucks’ bottom line. This exercise began as far back as January when Starbucks re-elected company founder Howard Schulz as CEO. Immediately, Howard whipped up a  “Transformation Agenda,” communicated to the public on their website as numbered announcements.    Here’s What’s Up.   Over a period of several years, Starbucks grew to become an Arcadia to coffee lovers. But, over the past couple of years, this paradise has begun to slip away from them.   Even though the company still maintains a loyal following (I know at least one person who goes their 2x per day every day), less loyal people are flocking to cheaper vendors who are now offering “premium” blends, such as McDonalds and Dunkin’ Donuts.  A recent article  even pointed out that McDonalds plans to launch espressos and mochas nationwide this year.   How Does Starbucks Plan to Regain Their Position?   Watching this Transformation Agenda come to fruition has been fascinating to watch. It’s a truly massive business, sales, and marketing initiative from top to bottom. The Agenda outlines the following courses of action:     Slow the pace of U.S. store openings and accelerate internationally   Discontinue warmed breakfast sandwiches at our North American stores  (the smell interferes with the aroma of their coffee … Um, k.)    Going forward, they will not report same store sales comps   Reinvent partner training   Reinstating regularly scheduled open forums in the field   Bring back the Leadership Conference     Through the numbered announcements and other research, I was also able to identify the following.     Adding Wi-Fi to all US stores (rolling out this service market-by-market to more than 7,000 Starbucks stores)   In-store training for their more than more than 135,000 store partners in the US. (which included closing stores during this training)   A reorganization that will eliminate 600 positions (mostly non-retail support folks)   Introduction of the Park Place blend (the everyday Joe’s blend - smoother than most Starbucks blends that’s receiving very mixed reviews)     Ask the Customer   Throughout nearly every Agenda announcement written by Howard he stresses the importance to have a “laser focus” on the customer. This left me saying “but, are you talking to them yet??” Well, today I just discovered that the company is now soliciting feedback from customers through a CRM portal called “ My Starbucks Idea .”     I’m not sure when it launched, but it is a pretty serious endeavor. Interestingly, the portal is powered by  Salesforce.com  - a sign of their commitment for this venture to be truly built around the customer relationship. Many ideas are very creative. Others are just painfully obvious - like frequent buyer cards. I suppose it never dawned on me, but Starbucks has never offered a buy 9 get one free card before!   Now, of course, what’s most important is  what they do with this feedback . If they’re really “laser focused” on the customer, then the most important changes they make will stem from a consensus of pain points and ideas generated from My Starbucks Idea, in addition to the important business and organizational changes.   Going Back to Their Roots.   Another decision was made to - if only temporarily - bring back the store’s original logo, used on the coffee cup and sleeves.     It’s a strange double-finned mermaid thing (I should probably have known what this was, but I’m not up on my maritime mythical lore.  Here’s what it is , if you’re curious. Funny, but I guess even the “new” logo is also this double-finned creature, you just see mostly her face). Anyway …. it’s not really the logo that matters. It’s symbolic of their commitment to bring Starbucks back to its roots - before they tried to be all things to all people. CDs, sandwiches, a shop on every corner…   What’s probably most promising is that this is clearly not a slapdash program. Howard and the rest of Starbucks’ leadership are executing on careful planning, and communicating to shareholders, the public, and their partners in a very systematic fashion.   What Do You Think?   So what does everyone out there think? What would you tell  Tomer  (our Director of Development) who has stock in Starbucks? Hang in there, or cash it in?                           262f                Posted in  General  |    5 Comments »                            Collaboration! It’s More than Tools.         By  Angie Terrell  on Wednesday, April 9th, 2008                    Full Disclosure - I’m not sure if you’ll believe me, but I started this blog BEFORE Stan Rapp and Rick Milenthal each gave separate presentations on the future of the Collaborative Model, of Engauage, to us here at Engauge Digital (formerly Spunlogic).   I’m certainly not anything special. And certainly not as visionary as the leaders of this new Engauge agency model. In retrospect, what I think happened is that in the past three months that I have been here, I have observed how Spunlogic sets itself apart by its level of effective collaboration. AND, that is exactly why Stan, Rick and the other leaders of Engauge thought we were such a great fit to this new agency model. It was synchronicity!   Wiki ,  Basecamp , Video Conference,  GoTo Meeting ,  Sosius ,  Joyent , etc. are tools that help us collaborate. But, can tools make collaboration successful in and of themselves? Absolutely not.   Effective collaboration is impossible without the existence of important human factors. Teams made of members, equal in their contribution, all offering a unique skill set and points of view, come together to form an effective and efficient organism. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,  sometimes . Stan Rapp made a great point by saying that true collaboration occurs when “specialists  voluntarily  join together to provide amazing results.”   That’s the power of collaboration. While tools can facilitate the communication and organization of the team, there is no substitute for true passion, skill, and camaraderie.   One of the wonderful things about Wiki is that everyone can contribute. It provides equalization of information, democracy in action, freedom of speech. This is what everyone finds so liberating about these tools. But we all know what speech can be like if collaboration breaks down. Silence, probably the best option, or worse, hurtful, discriminating and demoralizing speech impacting the entire group. What the best tools can do is to aid in the access and ease of information and knowledge sharing. What we humans have to do is the hard part.   So what makes human collaboration effective?   + Atmosphere of trust & respect  + Creativity  + Open, regular and organized communication  + Understanding everyone’s roles & responsibilities  + Highlighting everyone’s strengths  + Have fun: laugh and play  + Learning from each other  + Everyone feels empowered to make decisions  + Everyone is after a common goal   When does collaboration breakdown?   + CYA: paranoia amongst team members  + Process for the sake of process  + No fun! It’s all work, work, work  + Meeting for the sake of meeting  + Silos of communication  + Decisions can only be made top-down  + Everyone has their own goals they are trying to achieve through the group   No tools can prevent or promote these things. This has to come from us. If we don’t protect these things then the door is wide open for breakdown to creep in.   So the next time you are meeting with a colleague, thinking about how to solve a problem, constructing a project plan, remember the power of effective collaboration and amazing results will ensue!

By  Stephanie Critchfield  on Tuesday, April 8th, 2008                  Everyone involved in digital marketing is well aware that every year —  since, what, 2000?  — has been named “The Year of Mobile.”   Without surprise, yet another year is coming up short.   AdAge  came out with an interesting article ( Why ‘08 Isn’t Mobile’s Year — Again  [requires subscription to read]) that tackles the reasons why we have been prematurely forecasting every new year as THE year, along with fixes that make 2009 more probable.   AdAge’s outlined mobile’s challenges as:   CHALLENGE NO. 1: REACH (OR LACK THEREOF)  CHALLENGE NO. 2: MEASUREMENT  CHALLENGE NO. 3: COMPLEXITY  CHALLENGE NO. 4: THE MISNOMER OF MOBILE AS AD MEDIUM  CHALLENGE NO 5: THERE’S BEEN NO HALLELUJAH MOMENT   I think Ad Age did a really decent job of identifying the pieces of the puzzle that must fit together before THE year can happen. The biggest point is that the technology need to reach the masses is still not widely adopted.   “Of the 219 million U.S. wireless subscribers, just over 30 million are on data plans, according to M:Metrics. That means more than 86.1% still use mobile devices primarily for talk, which isn’t optimal for mobile marketing.”   Clearly, there is progress that needs to be made before mobile takes off. As AdAge suggests, beginning to define the elements that will create success now will serve us well when the audience is ready for it.

David   12 Sep 2005   111 comments   Latest by  loisnicholas                        We all cheered as Yahoo cut the check and rewarded one of the most promising startups in Web 2.0. And rightfully so. Flickr took something as mundane as sharing your pictures online and spun it in a way that made everyone want to take lots of pictures.    But it was more than that. The human voice of Flickr gave it a homey, quirky sense of people having fun doing what they love. From the very first moment you not only liked the service but also cared for the people behind it. It was enough to make it a no-brainer to put your photos on their server.    Now that welcoming, quirky, human voice has been strangled and replaced by the metallic commands of a corporate droid. It’s a damn shame and a terrible business move, in my humble opinion. Hopefully it won’t stand.                 Consider the signup screen for Flickr before Yahoo:       They make jokes about the screen name, remind you that it’s changeable, express their hatred for spam, and poke fun at the terms of use. And just as importantly, they only ask three questions and a confirmation. That’s it. Takes no time to complete, involves little brain activity, and you get to chuckle about it. In other words, a near perfect signup procedure.    Now consider the signup screen for Flickr after Yahoo (which in true megaplex style requires three redirects and clicking signup twice, both on Flickr and the Yahoo-Flickr site):       Not only is it two-and-a-half times longer, it involves  sixteen  questions and an opt-out cross-sell “opportunity” to get Yahoo Mail. It wants to know what industry you’re in and whether you like your Yahoo content from the US or Korea. It needs your first name, last name, gender, and possibly the middle name of your father.    It features a terms of service agreement that sounds like it was written by nasty lawyers armed with medieval instruments of truth-extraction. And they display it in the classic nobody-is-ever-going-to-read-this 4-line textarea.     The contrast to plain English terms like “You must not abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate or intimidate other Flickr users” from the  original agreement  couldn’t be starker.    “But only pedantic industry insiders care about all of this,” you say? Wrong. The only reason I dug into this issue and found these apalling before and after shots is because my lovely girlfriend tried to sign up for Flickr last night.     She didn’t made it and  ended up  at  23hq  instead. Flickr squandered the implicit trust I had for them by subjecting her to this cruel and unsual signup hell.    This, however, is not meant to be a slam as much as a cry for mercy. Yahoo, Flickr, we know you guys can do so much better than this. We know that you don’t intend to poison the well for future acquisitions and make users hate them on instinct.    To Yahoo : Recognize that the reason you bought Flickr in the first place was (hopefully) because you liked the groove they had going on. And even more so, you liked the demonstrated success of said groove. Consider if the droidinization of Flickr perhaps couldn’t have happened slower, later, and with fewer casulties. You guys stand to be the new cool. This is one step forward, two backwards.    To Flickr : Come on, guys. You had us eating out of your palms. You’re so much cooler than this. We know its  not your lips talking  when you say “Another motivation is all the stuff that Flickr can leverage from around the Yahoo! network if people can use their Yahoo! IDs in Flickr.”    In other words, this is not about big being bad (we have plenty of other posts on that). This is just about not turning people away at the door, about doing more of what made you superstars in the first place, and about showing that the latest surge of M&A activity isn’t all about killing kittens.    We trust that the two of you can work it out!                          111 comments so far             ( Jump to latest )                                             greggo my eggo            12 Sep 05     Oh dear. I’ve already saught professional counseling as a result of the near-raping of Flickr. Maybe Yahoo! can reimburse me.                                 Joshua Rudd            12 Sep 05     My wife had the same frustration when trying to sign up for a Flickr account — the very same day that they began requiring new accounts to sign up with a Yahoo! ID.    After an hour of frustration (trying to update her old Yahoo! account settings to reflect her new email address) and then being unable to delete her new Flickr account because the passwords mismatched (which they didn’t), she gave up, sent Flickr a nasty email, and vowed to never use Flickr.    It’s a shame because she didn’t get to experience the coolness the is (or was) Flickr, and i doubt she’ll give it another try — and she’s only one case-in-point.                                 Jay Owen            12 Sep 05     I experienced this same problem when I suggested someone signup for Flickr. I said… “hey, give this a try, it’s easy to signup and use…”    Well it turns out that it is no longer easy to sign up, it is a royal pain. It’s a sad story and a good example of getting real in reverse.                                Dana O           12 Sep 05     I’d hope that Flickr comes through too. I was a Pro account holder before Yahoo came along. Since then they gave members some free perks (like extended memberships and things). If things keep going the way they are though, I may cancel my account after the free stuff ends….                                 Joe Clark            12 Sep 05     It seems like your complaint is really about the complexity of signing up for a Yahoo userID, which you only have to do if you don’t have one in the first place. If it were a three-question exercise complete with witty repartee, would you mind so much?    The business about  ancien  Flickr being homey and fun while  nouveau  Flickr is a corporate sellout is a bit oversold, I think.                                 Brandon            12 Sep 05     I signed up for Flickr just a couple of days before they started allowing Yahoo! ID logins. Recently I found this on the Flickr Help Page:    “Please note that we will be migrating all independent Flickr accounts to Yahoo!’s network in 2006. At that time, if you have not done so already, you will be asked to create a Yahoo! ID (or link your account to your Yahoo! ID if you already have one) in order to continue using your account.”    I signed up for Flickr. The last things I want are a Yahoo! email account and access to the Yahoo! network. When they force me to create a Yahoo! ID, and make me go through that arcane sign-up page, they’ll lose me as a customer.                                  raul            12 Sep 05     amen. the reason people were so religious about flickr was because of it’s human scale. The small niceties like a simple signup devoid of marketing and legalese are the hallmark of a company committed to it’s users rather than to some larger corporate entity.                                 Jeff Croft            12 Sep 05     Sorry, but I’m with Joe Clark on this one. The process of signing up for a Yahoo ID is a bit more complicated than the process of signing up for an old Flickr account, but that’s really the extent of the “corporatisim” in the new Flickr. In my opinion, Flickr has done a very good job of keeping its edge despite it having a corporate giant for an owner. Flickr still “has massages.” We still get the blog from Heather and Caterina. All in all, it’s the same old place. The signup process could be easier, but like Joe said — the idea that Flickr is totally different now that it’s corporate it totally oversold.                                Brad           12 Sep 05     The Yahoo registration process is a deterrent in general, I think. A friend of mine recently invited me to join a Yahoo group she created, but I decide not to join after being confronted with the Yahoo signup page and reading their terms of use…I figured I’d either get flooded with spam or Yahoo would drop some spyware into my computer, or both.                                 Jake Tracey            12 Sep 05     I’ve been meaning to write about this for quite a while. A couple of months back when Yahoo! launched their new search interface, it seemed as if they were getting on the right track in terms of image again. Employees even had blogs, long before (most) other companies jumped on the bandwagon. The acquisition of products like Flickr and Konfabulator again strengthened the idea that yeah, Yahoo!might not be just a corporate behemoth. Hell, they may even ‘get it’.     Unfortunately, it’s a little sad to see some of the bad decisions they’ve made in the past few weeks. From the Y! Messenger default settings that change your default home page to the rename of Konfabulator to Yahoo! Widgets and now this.    What Yahoo! doesn’t understand is that no one wants to join them anymore. It feels like it’s always the bottom line at work (get that extra lead/sale/signup), and that isn’t the kind of business that people are passionate about.                                emm ess eff           12 Sep 05     With apologies to the Buggles:    Yahoo killed the Web 2.0 star  Yahoo killed the Web 2.0 star    Pictures came and broke your heart.

I just signed into Yahoo and was done.  From all the comments here it seems I am in the minority as most users don’t have Yahoo ids?

As you may have already heard, Oddpost was acquired by Yahoo! last year. Since then we’ve been cranking away on a new version of Yahoo! Mail, and we’re just about ready to show it to you and hear what you think.    If you’d like to try out the new Yahoo! Mail beta, send an email from your Oddpost account to support@oddpost.com and include:    1. Your Oddpost username  2. Your Yahoo! ID (if you do not have a Yahoo! ID, you can get one for free by clicking here)  We’ll email you back as soon as your beta account is ready to go.    IMPORTANT: we are NOT migrating your Oddpost account now. This is just a sneak peek of what’s in store for all Oddpost users in the months to come.    Thanks very much, we’re looking forward to your feedback!  The Oddpost team    P.S. for the nerds: if you like the new Yahoo! Mail beta so much that you’d like to start using it full-time for your mail, drop us a line and we’ll happily start forwarding your Oddpost mail over to Yahoo! now.

They’ve turned a casual walk in the park into a mountain trek across three state lines.

Jimbo           12 Sep 05     David, Sorry that this is off-topic, but I was wondering could you share how you took your Yahoo! webpage image. I’ve been trying to do this with Safari (Save-as-pdf, and tweaking the page settings so that it all renders on a single page). There must be an easier way!                                  Brady           12 Sep 05     Pretty awful.  I’ve tried to walk users that did not have an email address through Yahoo’s sign-up form and it is painful.  MSN’s is worse.    Hopefully Flickr won’t be degraded in other areas.  But, hey, if it does it opens the market for a new player!                                 Jake Tracey            12 Sep 05     “Jake, what you don understand is that most of the world isn like you. Your techie, your in the know. Most aren and would happily join Yahoo.”    Why would a regular consumer join Yahoo over any other company? Yahoo has lost a huge amount of mindshare in the past few years (in a number of different markets) and will continue to do so if they keep making poor decisions. Flickr was gaining popularity at a very fast rate and could’ve held it’s own without this change — after reading some responses to the changes it seems they might even lose a portion of the users that joined the service before the acquisition.     There are plenty of examples of host companies that successfully promote individual brands without making arbitrary changes like Yahoo does — wouldn’t you agree that by basically making Flickr a Yahoo branded service it lowers the chances of Flickr being known as THE place to share photos?                                 Brandon            12 Sep 05     “Brandon: Youe a USER, not a CUSTOMER. That one helluva difference.”    I don’t agree, Thomas. Yes, I use Flickr’s service. But if I like the experience, then once a year I will pay money to Flickr and in exchange they will provide me with a service to use. Isn’t that the basic relationship between any seller/buyer, producer/consumer? Customer and user aren’t mutually exclusive. Am I not both at the same time when paying for and using Flickr?    I don’t find Yahoo’s services appealing, and haven’t really enjoyed the past experiences I’ve had with them. So my point was that if Yahoo takes over Flickr with a heavy hand, changes the “culture,” and turns it into just another Yahoo service, I’m not going to be happy with it anymore and will stop paying for the right to use it. Yes, that will make me a former USER of Flickr, but when we cease to exchange money for goods and services, that will also make me a former CUSTOMER.                                 Charles Miller            12 Sep 05     When Flickr introduced Yahoo! logins, I moved over to my (existing) Yahoo! screen-name almost immediately. I didn’t really care either way, but since the documentation stated quite starkly that my existing Flickr ID was going to be made obselete some time in the future, I figured I may as well make the switch.    What they  didn’t  mention was… “Remember me” didn’t work. They only fixed that a few days ago. Which suggests to me that Flickr was pushed quite firmly towards screen-name sharing , even before it could be completely implemented.    Meanwhile, another annoyance has surfaced. I like having Flickr remember my identity, but I feel uncomfortable staying logged in to the entire network of Yahoo sites, most of which I don’t use. However, I can’t stay logged into one without being logged into them all.                                Anonymous Coward           12 Sep 05     @Jimbo, I bet he used  Paparazzi                                 Tim Lucas            12 Sep 05     I’m not stating my opinion, only my experiences, and I’ve had 2 friends in the past few days refuse to sign up to Flickr because of the rego process (and they’re both non-techies). One went to Kodakgallery instead, even after my constant harassment, and the other decided sharing photos wasn’t for them. I hadn’t even noticed they’d changed the process until I asked them why they hadn’t registered yet.                                  Brad           12 Sep 05     Jeff Croft: Corporate Sellouts?

I’m  sure  Yahoo told our Flickr buddies: “We love Flickr as it is and promise not to change it … much.”    The Flickr folk were probably too busy counting the zeros on the check in front of them, and missed that little disclaimer. Sellouts.    I’m just pissed that I never got around to applying for that Linux sysadmin job Flickr had posted pre-buyout. Wonder what my options would’ve been worth?  :)                                  Firefly           12 Sep 05     Flickr is dying…    A corporate picture site is spawned.                                 Peter Mentzer            12 Sep 05     Anyone else notice the fact that the flickr logo **still** says “beta”? I think that’s kind of funny.  I don’t know, but the ‘beta’ thing kind of rubs me the wrong way. Like, you can pull it off when it’s just you and a couple folks trying out your idea, but once yahoo buys you? Then it just becomes a marketing ploy to make your company seem “accessible”. You know, like hey, we’re just a couple guys with some computers in our garage trying something “nifty” (to use a flickr type word.)                                kmilden           12 Sep 05     Yahoo wonders why google owns 60% of search. It is because they keep it simple, real, and to the point. Google buys bloggerthey didn’t add their logo, a 16 question sign-up form, or tie it into a gmail upsell…                                 JenF            12 Sep 05     So what’s a Flickr type company to do when they do sell to a big bohemoth like Yahoo? Our company was in a similar situation. One day we were 4 people making our own rules, and the next, we were owned by a publicly-held company with a board of directors and volumes of rules and regulations that need to be followed as a public company. And OMG don’t get me started on Sarbanes Oxley.     We  have  to have terms and conditions - we simply can’t get around it. Does anybody have any suggestions on incorporating them in such a way as to not send droves of people running away screaming for their lives? We want to stay nifty and fun and connect with our customers, but we have to do it within the rules of the parent company.                                  Beau Hartshorne            12 Sep 05     A Yahoo account provides much more than just Flickr access. I can see the need for more vigorous bot checking, and for a few extra measures to protect a user’s identity. Your old Flickr account didn’t have a finance section. Considering the constraints, what could be better? Can we lose the “Customizing Yahoo” section?                                Mr. Jones           12 Sep 05     If your girlfriend is unable to handle Yahoo’s signup form, she is probably better off using 23hq.

Anonymous           12 Sep 05     You people act like signing up with Yahoo is like signing some contract that forces you to use all their services. You don’t have to use Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Forums or any of Yahoo’s services if you don’t want to. All that changes is the Flickr signup and signin forms are a little different.                                  Brad           12 Sep 05     Anonymous:  All that changes is the Flickr signup and signin forms are a little different.    You miss the point.      Something that was simple has become complex with no added benefit.      You might argue that there is added benefit, that Yahoo offers services you didn’t have a choice with before.  That’s not the point.  If you want to sign up with Flickr now, it’s more complicated than before.  Period.    This argues what I continue to feel about convergence in all realms.  Do one thing and do it well.  Phones shouldn’t be MP3 players or cameras.  MP3 players shouldn’t be PDA’s.  Still cameras shouldn’t be video cameras.  All these things make sense on the surface but fall apart in practice.  Just because something has a processor inside, doesn’t mean it should take advantage of every single aspect of the processor.  My PVR has a hard drive and a CPU, but that doesn’t mean it should be used as a camera.      So then the argument goes, but I have so many devices.  Combining them makes things easier.  I say no.  It’s like the Yahoo sign up form for Flickr.  I can do lots on that form, but it sucks and I don’t like it.  I want a phone that works as a phone, a camera that works as a really good camera and an MP3 player that is called the iPod nano.      Do one thing and do it well.  If you want to do something else, create a new brand or a new category.      Yahoo should have hidden themselves behind Flickr and used their power to market and promote from outside the spectrum.  Instead they cannibalized their audience and will inevitably turn Flickr into something unrecognizable.    Read  Positioning  by Jack Trout and Al Ries.  Even though it all about marketing, but so is everything.    One final argument for this tangent.  We love (I assume) 37Signals for what they do.  But if JF came out tomorrow and said, “We’re selling TVs”, not only would we not buy their TVs, but we would lose some interest in their existing product line.  Why?  37Signals represents great web applications.  But that greatness does not extend to other realms.  Yahoo doesn’t understand that Flickr meant something to its supporters.  Just because Yahoo and Flickr are both Internet companies does not make them compatible brands.  I’m not saying Yahoo shouldn’t have bought Flickr, I’m just saying they did it the wrong way.  Theye an Internet company with no real identity.  What is Yahoo?  Who knows?  But this is the message of the Flickr form:     ey, sign up for Flickr and Yahoo Email, and get a Yahoo ID (well actually you need a yahoo ID) and if you don have one, well, here how you get one and if youe forgotten it well here is how you get it back and thanks for you support and if you don want spam please let us know otherwise wel send it to you./em>    Instead of:    Make a great online photo album without hassles                                 vishi            12 Sep 05     The Flickr login was done by one guy, while this decision came out of a discussion.                                Chris           12 Sep 05     Brad is totally correct. I’m glad someone commenting “gets” it rather than simply flaming.                                 Brady           12 Sep 05     cheers to Brad                                James Cruden           13 Sep 05     It’s odd to read this reaction and mesh it with the frequent calls in the comments on this very site for a practically identical maneuver by 37signals for their own products.    All that Yahoo! has done here is pull their newly acquired “product” under their existing set of products and allow users to login to all the Yahoo! services with the same account.    I completely fail to understand how that would cause problems for people.     90% of the websites out there that require registration want too much information from you. Simple fact is that they’re holding the cards, and if you want to use their service, you’re going to have to give them that information. washingtonpost.com, for example, requires a pretty much identical set of information, on top of a bunch of “email newsletters” and “select advertisers offers”.    Really, this is just in place to put all users of Yahoo! services on the same level, so that users who wish to use more than on service can do so without having to create new accounts, remember multiple passwords and increase the likelihood that users will try out other services offered by Yahoo! and increase their market share. Considering the fact that they spent so much money on acquiring flickr, it’s not such an unreasonable request, really.    And, let’s not forget - every time that discussion of 37s products come along, there are a lot of request for 37s to create a single login for backpack, basecamp, ta-da-lists and whatever else may come along.                                 Dan Hartung            13 Sep 05     Brad’s right — this is just step one on the road to making Flickr just an interface to “Yahoo! Photos”. (Since that’s what they did with Oddpost — chuck its backend in under Yahoo! Mail — I assume something similar will eventually happen.)    That’s not a tragedy, really. Right now (and I’m not a member, just an observer) Flickr’s A+ has merely been downgraded to an A. And Flickr’s featureset is definitely going to live on (indeed, it’s going to become increasingly copied) — so if that’s what you’re there for, I don’t think there’s much to worry about.    If you were there for the indieness, for the community, you’ll probably feel sidelined. I think that’s the signal here.    But it’s not going to slow down the whole Yahoo! Photos strategy — mark my words, in 18 months or so Grandma will be using Yahoo! Photos to tag and stream her digicam output (“My rhodendrons! My great-grandchildren!”). But the unique community that was Flickr will be gone.    Make no mistake, either — the Flickr crew knew all this going into the deal. They’re smart people who saw an opportunity. I don’t begrudge them that, nor do I think they’re having night sweats about the decision. This was an integral, pre-ordained result of the sale of the company.    So what a Flickr type company to do when they do sell to a big bohemoth like Yahoo?    Don’t sell. Have you been reading SvN long?

I think the obvious lesson is, if you sell to a behemoth like Yahoo, you’ll end up with a stupider product.  The ideal situation is to find a way to make a company/service profitable /sustainable without selling yourself to a larger company.

Larry Williams            13 Sep 05     Luckily I signed up before Yahoo acquired Flickr. I was personally not impressed with Flickr after signing up. The user interface is terrible. There seems to be 100 ways of organizing your pictures on 100 different pages. I’ll be looking for something else I think soon. My own hosing would be the best. Does anyone know how to export pictures from Flickr?                                 Stewart Butterfield            13 Sep 05     Some responses (from a Flickr founder):    * It’s no great secret that Yahoo’s registration sucks - we’re working on changing it, but as you can imagine, that is a slow and difficult process. And though it’s easy to imagine that everyone is stupid or clueless, or that that is one evil wizard pulling the strings making things bad, that’s just not the case. It’s complicated, there are a lot of people involved, and there is a lot at stake. It will get better though. (And, though I’m happy to say it sucks, it’s really not “this cruel and unsual signup hell” or “a mountain trek across three state lines” - you guys are just spoiled by good design ;)    * The Yahoo! TOS and privacy policies are much longer and harder to grok, but: (i) in all respects where they differ from the Flickr TOS/PP, they are more restrictive in what we can do and more liberal in what users can do (viz., they are better for users), and (ii) once you get to Yahoo! scale (400m users) I’m not sure if there is any way around language like that: these companies are big tagets for legal action due to their size and the way to achieve precision and a lack of ambiguity in legal prose just doesn’t match with what normal people can understand.   Blame the legal tradition for that one, but it sure has a real impact. Example: people feel like they “can’t trust” Yahoo! because it’s big, but 23people’s completely blank TOS  http://www.23hq.com/23/terms  and about page  http://www.23hq.com/23/about  are OK …    * The majority of net users (in most countries) already have a Yahoo! ID, so for most people, this is much easier: all they have to do is chose a screen name for use on Flickr. Believe it or not, it’s a fact.     * Like Joe Clark and Jeff Croft, I can’t help but agree - Flickr hasn’t changed, other than the signup process. It’s still awesome :) And though we’re spending a lot of our time dealing with massive growth, we are not close to done on the product. It will be bigger, better, faster, funner than ever before.    I’ll leave it to the experts (Dan? ;) to say how it will all come out in the end, but I do know that pretty much everyone I work with at Yahoo! “get’s it” as much as the people posting here. Proofs in the pudding and I’m happy to stand by how things are in 18 months.                                 Larry Williams            13 Sep 05     hosing=hosting ;)                                Chris           13 Sep 05     Yahoo is a big corporation, with lawyers and with groups of staff each of which need their ‘me too’ moment. It needs these lengthy sign-ups to give every single opportunity to grab people into their network. And, as others have written, Flickr is no more. It’s a piece of technology which is now being subsumed into the Yahoo way of thinking.    It’ll happen with all the online entertainment services that News Corp are buying, and it’ll happen to Skype now that eBay have ‘em.    Personally, I can’t stand lengthy signups. It may well be that the next generation of web users, those who will fully appreciate and use Web 2.0 (or n+1) technology, agree, then all might change.                                Paul D           13 Sep 05     “Something that was simple has become complex with no added benefit.”    Add “ridiculously” before “complex” and you have it in a nutshell.    I signed up for Flickr two months ago and found it so useful I bought a pro account. I had been eyeing Flickr for a few weeks beforehand, and the sign-up looked so easy I finally went for it. If I was interested today, that awful Yahoo page would scare me away. I would skip it altogether. I don’t want a fricking Yahoo ID, thank you, and I can do without the frustration of a 3-page sign-up process. People like me are damned tired of the way corporations treat us.                                Paul D           13 Sep 05     “The majority of net users (in most countries) already have a Yahoo! ID, so for most people, this is much easier: all they have to do is chose a screen name for use on Flickr. Believe it or not, it a fact.”    There’s an eight-letter word to describe that statement. The first four are “bull”. More likely, you have lots of people with 4 Yahoo accounts they don’t use or remember because they tried signing up for something like Yahoo Groups (like I did years ago), disliked the experience, and abandoned the account.                                David Heinemeier Hansson           13 Sep 05     Just for the record, this is about the signup process. Not about any other qualities of Flickr. Of course it’s not all gone to hell. Flickr is still great.    What I’m saying is that its a damn shame that the signup process had to go through this frankenstein transformation so soon. Especially if Yahoo is working on making the signup less insane. Why not wait just a little longer until it didn’t hurt this month? Why the rush?    Regarding the TOS, it’s not about what rights the new or the old did or didn’t give. It’s about decrying the loss of a human voice. Just as this whole debate is about the loss of the human touch in language and ordeal around signup.    I have no illusions thinking that Flickr can turn the supertanker that is Yahoo signup around from one day to the next. That’s why its so painful to see that it had to go so damn fast to get Flickr on board of that.    In the end, no one is arguing whether neither Yahoo or Flickr has “the right” to do this. That would be a silly argument. The argument is merely that this is turning people away who aren’t already in Yahoo land (and I certainly don’t recognize the stat that the “majoirty of the net” should be active Yahoo users) and the loss of human welcome for those who do manage to get through it. And if Flickr is to remain the premier destination for online photo sharing, this is not helping.                                Oscar           13 Sep 05     Enough.  Sigining up for Yahoo! is a pain, no doubt. The new Yahoo! IM is intrusive and unfair, as it should ask for what it installs, not for what it does not install.  If you do not have a Yahoo! ID, it is definitelly a pain to sign up for Flickr, above all if that involves retrieving from the depths of your memory that old ID.  But c’mon, if the problem of new Flickr is just the log in, well, it is more difficult, but possible.  And above all, why on earth people do NOT want to have a Yahoo! ID or an e-mail or have access to the network??? I have it but never use it. That’s all.                                Brad           13 Sep 05     Just for the record, this is about the signup process. Not about any other qualities of Flickr.    Sort of agree, although since David started the thread, who am I to say what this is all about.     However, although it may only be specifically about the signup process, it represents bigger issues.    Yahoo has the perception that co-branding (Yahoo Flickr or whatever the new incarnation will be) is better than one name on its own.  Yahoo also seems to have made these changes because it is easier for Yahoo, not necessarily easier for the Flickr users (new or old).    The word  Yahoo  doesn’t mean anything except maybe “Big Internet Company”.  I firmly believe that Flickr would enjoy far more success if Yahoo had hidden its ownership (or shielded) and used its power to promote and market Flickr on it’s own and took advantage of the good will already established.      It’s like when Big Bird (See “Follow that Bird”) from Sesame Street was adopted by the Dodo’s.  He thought it would be great to be in a place with other birds, but in the end they just tried to turn him into a Dodo.    That’s what happening to Flickr, it’s being turned into a Dodo.  Not because any one person is stupid.  I believe Stewart when he says that everyone is working hard and smart.  But I don’t believe that a corporation like Yahoo, with all its layers of bureaucracy and legalese has the confidence or the ability or the agility to lead a company like Flickr with the passion or innovation that Stewart and his wife were able to.  Flickr will be bigger than before, for sure, it will have more members than before, for sure, but it will be like McDonalds compared to the trendy bistro.                                 Martin            13 Sep 05     My summary of the two sign-up pages:    OLD: Provide us with the bare minimum to use the service.    NEW: Additional fields for advertising purpose only: gender, birthday, first and last name, zip code,industry, specialisation, title    It is about the feel of it. It feels like you got into an iterrogation. I think David is right, it lost the human touch (“come, get in”), the user is now treated like something to be squeezed out.    No doubt, the yahoo marketing department is constantly demanding more “knowledge” about its users to offer more “targeted” advertisement. And default subscription to yahoo mail so the numbers look good.                                  Arthur Hodgkiss           13 Sep 05     > Flickr would enjoy far more success if Yahoo had hidden   > its ownership (or shielded) and used its power to promote  > and market Flickr    Couldn’t agree more. Talk about destruction. The Flickr admins tell us it’s going to be all right, but I’m not optimistic.    Luckily, I have a few spare non-Pro accounts already set up, so I can hopefully avoid having to login to Flahoo as fluffy_bunny_90210 - for the time being at least.                                A Nonnie Moose           13 Sep 05     Speaking of inane registration processes…   https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsMailSignup1                                Jordan Roher           13 Sep 05     Of course, the flipside to all this is that if you have a Yahoo! ID and want to sign up for Flickr, you just type in your password, pick a Flickr nickname, and you’re done.  You can go from Yahoo! user to Flickr member in the same amount of time it takes to use the old sign up form (or at least I did).    I’m still wondering why the Flickr community is so up in arms about all this.  So now they have to sign up for a Yahoo! account.  Did Yahoo! change any of Flickr’s policies or prices?  Has the site functionality changed?  Is there more intrusive advertizing?  Or is this akin to Mac users complaining that the appearance of their still totally usable and breathtakingly intuitive programs changes slightly on each revision?                                 Fathead            13 Sep 05     I hate Yahoo with a passion, but I never let it get in the way of business. I never use the email address, so that’s not a problem. I only sign up for what I want when I really want it bad. Yahoo sucks in bulk but I’m not scared to use ‘em and abuse ‘em. I don’t have to read their ads and I get what I want. When it gets too hard, I’ll dump them no problem.                                 Utter Doul            13 Sep 05     Your post pointed me to 23hq and I noticed that though in their FAQ they say the free account has 15MB monthly quota, on signing up, the upload page says I have a 1024MB quota. Just FYI.                                 Kim Siever            13 Sep 05     Well, this now explains why none of my family have signed up when I’ve invited them to join. I guess I joined Flickr early enough to avoid all that.                                 test            13 Sep 05     ttest                                 Bryan C            13 Sep 05     C’mon, guys. It’s not that bad, and it’s way overblown to suggest that flickr is ruined. It is a useless and divisive and stupid change, however, and I hope that Stewart and friends are doing their best to drum that in at Yahoo.     And it seems like a solution would be simple. Have a staged signup. where the basic three-questions and the bot protection field are required for access. The other stuff can wait until later, maybe when people put in their payment information to buy prints or whatever. Or offer some kind of incentive (more storage?) for users who want to give more information. This is the way things work in the real world, so why not online?    But what companies need to realize is that that information is utterly and completely useless. Users put in false information wherever they can. They’ll check any checkbox, hit any submit button, and gleefully ignore any TOS because they know everyone else does the same. The only thing you can trust is what the user cares about, which is damn little. Everything else is a WOMBAT - a Waste Of Money, Brains And Time. While the corporate types imagine they’re collecting lucrative information it’s really a false metric of success that only encourages harmful policies.                                 dusoft            13 Sep 05     Yahoo ID! is awful thing. It is user unfriendly, it want so many information from you, I gave the signing up up lot of times, yet. Those have been many times when someone asked me to either join yahoo group or so and I refused because of this absolutely unusable yahoo ID!    Usable web will continue… but without YahooID! in its current form.    And “bullshit” is certainly the word used for describing YahooID! as having the most users in the world (or most of the users).

Is there no end to the things one can learn from SvN? :-)                                 todd            13 Sep 05     https://login.yahoo.com/config/login?.src=flkctx&.pc=5134&.done=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.yahoo.com%2Fconfig%2Fvalidate%3F.src%3Dflkctx%26.pc%3D5134%26.done%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fsignin%252Fyahoo%252F    This page is yahoo-ed too,,   Although it appears they tried to spice it up with some pretty lame lines - which somehow are obviously not written by anyone at Flickr, but instead someone at Yahoo.   When I saw this page I knew things were not going in the right direction.                                Kristopher Tillery           13 Sep 05     Despite what one might think after reading these comments, the Yahoo! brand is recognized and well-regarded in the United States and overseas.  I think that this is a supposition that can be generally accepted based on market research (http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_14/b3927419_mz079.htm as an example that can be found in ~10 seconds of searching; there are many more exhaustive studies that elude to this point).    Accepting the above supposition and explicitly separating the echnocratfrom the verageperson or the erson-at-largeon the internet, it becomes increasingly clear why Flickr (and the Flickr community) benefits from a Yahoo! network sign in, independent of the complexity that the new process adds.      The “average” or “non-technical” user was unlikely to be familiar with the Flickr brand or the “techie wit” that accompanied Flickr’s original sign in message.  To him/her, this familiarity in tone and lack of corporate affiliation might be disconcerting: one can easily imagine an “average” user confusing Flickr for some kind of college class project.  By associating the Flickr brand with the Yahoo! brand during the sign in process, “average” users are more likely to see the service as a mainstream, commercial option for photo sharing.  Thus, they may be equally willing to complete a more complex sign in process given the added benefit of a certain “brand security./p>   What, though, does this mean for the internet “technocrat”?  For him/her, the added inconvenience signals the death of the Flickr brand independent from its parent; this is in some sense unavoidable if Flickr is to broaden its audience target.  However, I would argue that the benefits derived from the Yahoo!-Flickr association outweigh the inconveniences driven by Yahoo! ownership because in the long term the Flickr community-at-large benefits greatly from a more diverse network of photos and members regardless of what happens to the Flickr brand.  Searching for photos flagged with the term “apple” will no longer return only images of the next greatest iPod; a search such as this might display images of a neighbor garden or a family’s trip to the orchard.  While this example is trivial, it reflects an important strength that Yahoo! has brought / will bring to the Flickr service: greater diversity in opinion and viewpoint.                                 Jill            13 Sep 05     I don’t like Yahoo.  The over all vibe seems pretty uncreative, unimaginative and unremarkable.  Their products are hard to use.  I don’t think the average person likes stuff that’s mediocre.  I don’t think this is a technocrat vs. average user thing.  I’m not a technocrat.  I’m just a girl with a Yahoo store. (Which I’m in the process of shutting down because it’s clunky and hard to use and yucky looking.)    Flickr still seems to be okay, though, for the most part.                                YahooRules!           13 Sep 05     Are you all upset that Flickr is more interested in getting money from Yahoo than your $24?                                 N8K99            13 Sep 05     I used to be able to bulk load an entire set of photographs to flickr.com and still use my cellphone to post photos to my blog. Now with the corporate Yahoo buyout, the drive to purchase the $24 account prohibits me from doing that. I did like it better when they were really free!                                 Brad           13 Sep 05     Kristopher Tillery: Despite what one might think after reading these comments, the Yahoo! brand is recognized and well-regarded in the United States and overseas.    That’s not the point.  I disagree with the premise of your argument.  That popularity can translate from one realm to another.  No doubt they will probably get bigger given Yahoo’s user base, but not nearly as big as they could have gotten if Yahoo would have kept Flickr as Flickr instead of turning it into Yahoo Flickr.      It is loosing what made it Flickr and turning into what makes Yahoo Yahoo.  Sure we are only talking about the sign up and sure the founders will try hard to keep the original flare, but it’s gone and grown up and been bought out.    Instead of standing on it’s own as the premier site for hosting your pictures it has now been swalled by Yahoo and has become yet another service of the behemoth.  It’s inevitable and it’s sad.  I’m crying.  I’m wallowing in my tears.  I’m actually wishing i was the one with the millions in my pocket from the sale.                                 Derek            13 Sep 05     If the Flickr signup procedure hadn’t changed, but it got you a Yahoo! ID instead, I think a lot fewer people would have been upset at the ID unification plan. But given how byzantine the new scheme is, they have got to be losing signups now. Here’s what I just wrote to Flickr via their feedback form:    http://www.flickr.com/help/website/#7    ——-    So, how do you respond to Jason at 37Signals?    http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/flickr_signup_from_human_to_droid_in_a_yahoo_moment.php    I’ve pointed several people to Flickr recently, and half of them gave up trying to sign up when they had to go through the Yahoo! procedure. That never happened before with your old signup.    I even signed up a friend myself because she’d just gotten married and was on honeymoon. I already _know_ how cool Flickr is, and I almost gave up setting up her account because of the Yahoo! signup hassle.    You have _got_ to do something. It’s fine to unify Flickr and Yahoo! IDs. But make signing up from Flickr as convenient as it used to be, even if you’re getting a Yahoo! ID in the process. Please oh please.                                 Stewart Butterfield            14 Sep 05     Derek, you can see how we respond if you scroll up. (And it was David, not Jason.)                                 Kyle           14 Sep 05     Alright, so the sign up is a bit abusive.  As a Pro Flickr user (from pre-Yahoo days) I really don’t understand the broo-ha-ha over the switch to Yahoo IDs.  It makes sense, it means I have one less username and password to remember, it ties Flickr into my other Yahoo services, and it generally makes life easier for me as a user.  Some people are just getting really silly about this change.                                 Frank            14 Sep 05     Interesting article about a rival fotoblogging site.                                 Kevin Cheng           14 Sep 05     Joshua said:   Did Yahoo! change any of Flickr policies or prices?     Yep they did. They made it cheaper and as Stewart said, more liberal to the user.                                Kristopher Tillery           14 Sep 05     Brad,    Thanks for the response to my previous comment.  However, I am a bit lost in regard to your assertion that Flickr could have grown even larger without the Yahoo! user base.    It seems that the real UED problem is not applicable to people who already hold a Yahoo! account (although I personally signed up pre-Yahoo! and thus can’t confirm that porting an existing Yahoo! ID to Flickr is painless). Thus, Flickr immediately benefits from access to and visibility among nearly 400MM people to whom this problem does not apply.    I just don’t see that data to support the assertion that Flickr would have grown larger without the Yahoo! user base.  Unfortunately, we both passed into hypotheticals so I am afraid there is no real test either way.  This would, though, make an interesting design lab experiment: mock-up a service and issue two versions (one with a corporate partner brand ad another independent).  Then, track the sign up patterns of users in a controlled environment where you can change one variable at a time (i.e. reduce subscription price on corporate-owned site, etc.)                                JC           14 Sep 05     Yahoo sign up screens and log in interface design has always been complete crap.  I’ve lost track of the number of times I have abandoned anything I wanted info on when I was caught in the yahoo trap. Typically, I miss one of the fields (easy to do) and when I click back, all or some of what I entered is missing. A realm pain! And thier obsession with passwords constantly is nuts. So I pretty much have avoided Yahoo with much pasion.  Now that Flickr is absorbed into that horid domain, I’ll probably avoid it too.                                 anil            14 Sep 05     Some more thoughts on the Flickr acquisition on my  blog . Personally, i’m of the view that a successful startup should seek commercial partnerships over acquisition.     Flickr is a social network. Social networks do not generally survive acquisition. At least i don’t know of any that have come through intact.                                Brad           14 Sep 05     Kristopher Tillery    I’m not saying they would have grown bigger without Yahoo’s user base, I’m saying they should have leveraged their user base and their deep pockets to market Flickr (among their user base and beyond) as Flickr, rather than as a service of Yahoo (Yahoo Photo’s, Yahoo Groups, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Flickr).    By cobranding (read: Melting Flickr into Yahoo) they are lessening the value of both Yahoo and Flickr.      What is Yahoo?  Who knows.      What was Flickr then?  Really cool social photo albums.  Period.    What is Flickr now?  Really cool pictures, a portal to Yahoo, a cross-selling mechanism to get new Yahoo users, a way to introduce people to other Yahoo services.      Yahoo is Walmart.  Walmart makes lots of money and has tonnes of customers.  People know what Walmart is and what it is not.    Flickr will change and become less like Flickr and more like Yahoo.  That is good for Yahoo, bad for Flickr.                                 david gunnells            14 Sep 05     @ Stewart: good luck getting the Yahoo signup crap down in size and obtusenes! the sooner, the better!     as a pro user (using flickr since summer ‘04), I’m not sold on the idea of being forced to create a yahoo id that is associated w/ my flickr account, especially considering I’ve paid for a pro account through summer of ‘07.    granted, all the info that I used to pay for the account is now sitting on a yahoo server somewhere (I guess) and there’s probably nothing I can do about that…but the forced yahoo id thing doesn’t make sense to me. if I wanted a yahoo ID, I’ll get one. if I wanted a flickr account, same thing. I don’t need both.    I agree w/ a few earlier posts of witnessing family/friends pass over signing up for flickr since the yahoo ID (fiasco?) and I didn’t realize what the deal was until one of them told me about the ridiculously long signup procedure, which I didn’t have to go through last year…    here’s to optimism and a few pints of Guinness to remind me that this is still just a silly point of discussion in the end.

Really cool pictures, a portal to Yahoo, a cross-selling mechanism to get new Yahoo users, a way to introduce people to other Yahoo services. “    What you’re saying is just plainly false - it’s not like we both have opinions about it and they are different: you are saying things that are incorrect.    Not sure if you’ve used Flickr before, but it is not “social photo albums” (and was not). And now it is not “a cross-selling mechanism to get new Yahoo users” - it’s the same as it was, except people use Yahoo! IDs for authentication. Yahoo could care less about a few hundred thousand people getting Yahoo! IDs.

It's the sequel to the  original Intelligence Toilet , which has been tracking and graphing the health of the 10,000 or so lucky souls who have purchased one since 2005, according to Toto. Like the original, the  Intelligence Toilet II  takes all kinds of readings from your urine, which are then organized into Wii Fit style charts and graphs on your PC via Wi-Fi. It's unclear what all is new aside from the aforementioned temperature monitoring, which can help women keep track of their menstruation cycles, but if you're going to import a crazy Japanese toilet, this is clearly the one.

Thanks again to Matt for taking the time to answer these and Bobby for arranging it all for us. Sadly Erik was unavailable to provide input to this Q&A session so Bobby Stickel from Privateer has added some of his responses to your questions.   How does this game change Privateer Press? Going forward will this game be an impetus to move PP into being more like WotC?   Matt Wilson : I dont think its possible for Privateer Press to be anything like WotC, at least not from a business stand-point, which I think is what is being implied here. For one, Wizards of the Coast is owned by a very big corporation  Hasbro  which is publicly traded and has a board of directors, etc. Privateer Press is privately held, independent and solvent, answering to no one but our customers. So, the comparison really cant be made.    What Monsterpocalypse will do to Privateer Press is allow us to grow, acquire new talent, make more great games and expand on the existing brands the way we have always wanted to.   Any details that you can give us regarding the first expansion for the game?   Bobby : Heres what I can say at this point& When it comes to our games, we like to say go Big or go home. I can also tell you that its being designed on an Apple computer. Seriously, its targeted for Spring of 2009, but well have more details and spoilers very soon.

This final set of questions deals with Rackham as a company and some technical aspects of running the company and developing their games.   I’d like to thank Jean for taking the time to answer the questions that we sent to him (and it was a significant number :-) and also thank those who took the time to send in their questions.   About Rackham    What effect the change from a private to a public firm has made in the way that Rackham creates their games and figures?    Objectively, none at all. It is up to us to be reliable. I owe results to our partners and the share holders who trusted us when they invested in Rackham and who renewed their trust during this difficult period of transition. I also owe it to our customers who have been supporting us by purchasing our games and miniatures.

Are GW players your target audience, or do you plan to break out and do heroes stylized to fit other games, other races or perhaps even come up with your own unique heroes?   My intention is my target audience being every miniatures gamer and collector.  It is true that due to my sculpting style, my figures specially attract GW players, which is something I am very proud of, as I believe GW already provides them with a really wide and high quality range of figures.   What games do you play and how does this influence your contract/ personal sculpting projects?   I have played a lot of games. I like saying that more than a sculptor I am a gamer who sculpts. I currently play Hordes, Warhammer and RPGs when I find the opportunity to.

Here are his responses.   One of the more possibly interesting questions was actually far too long to include but it might be an interesting jumping off point to talk about the brutality of the 40K setting. Its a rather  long comment by spooktalker  at this URL. I think the direct answer is that no-one wants escapist literature that is as brutal as the real-world but there is an interesting disconnect, I think, between the 40K setting itself and the types of books that get produced for it. Why do we want to read literature in a setting that seems to be antithetical to the notion of a hero?   Interesting point there (I went and read the thread). I would argue that 40K fiction is quite spectacularly brutal, and often shows the atrocious extremes of the Imperial regime. It is a particularly dark, callous and totalitarian place, where life is miserably cheap. However, I would find it pretty relentless if that’s all there was. Characters like Gaunt and Eisenhorn provide, I hope, points of reference in the gothic madness, sharing our horror or disgust at things. I’d like to think that even in the far future where there is only war, some human beings will still attempt to be decent and honourable.

Due to some overly sensitive spam filters our original questions didn’t make it to Jervis but we were able to rectify that problem and Jervis quickly sent along his answers to your questions.    Thanks very much to Jervis for taking time to answer these questions and also for getting them back to us so quickly.

Thanks to everyone who posted a question and thanks again to Matt for taking the time to answer these for us.   Are there plans for a novel line or a compilation of short stories?   Let’s say we’re in the preliminary stages of plans. Are we going to produce novelized fiction? Yes. Currently, we are determining the best way to produce this fiction and get it out to the readers. So, this isn’t an official announcement that it’s coming, but our hope is to be able to see something on the shelves in 2008.

The entire 70+minute interview was recorded and I’ve finally managed to get the first 30 minutes of it processed and ready for download.

Originally a 3D modeler and texture artist, he switched over 2D art and is now a widely recognized digital artist.  He has worked on several titles at Electronic Arts, and is currently heading up the concept art team at Propaganda Games. In addition he does freelance work for many clients, including Privateer Press. As Daryl’s art is such a prominent part of the Hordes game we thought we’d ask him a few questions about himself, working for Privateer Press and art.

We recently became aware of  TeacherTube , which is a video sharing site that has become a workaround for educators who can't access YouTube videos on the web. Many schools may block YouTube, but allow access to TeacherTube because it's an educational resource.

By leelefever on August 10, 2005 - 9:53am. 2 comments      Categories:  humor interview news        I really enjoyed reading the BBC  interview with Tim Berners-Lee .  But, I was in awe at how Mark Lawson kept trying to get him to say that he felt responsible for the bad elements of the web...   But do you feel responsible? You say humanity will do whatever it does with it, do you feel responsible for what happens?  You must reflect though on the law of unintended consequences because it wasn't remotely ever your intention when you started on this that so much of the web would be given over to sexual exhibitionists masturbating in their bedrooms with webcams. Do you ever have bad moments about that?

Jim           Hello Mike,       Was on your site today actually and am very impressed how much it has grown!        You only had about 15 companies when I sent mine in!        I like how you update within 24 hours, that's great, not every 6 mos like some.        You put a lot of energy into your site and it shows!        I'm sure it's pretty much a full time job but it's so great to see someone doing such a good job.        Everyone appreciates it!        Shar           Mike-   Just wanted to say your website is awesome and very helpful.         Thanks for that-        regards,       Ryan           Mike,       Your new site is excellent.

I know a lot of new-hire pilots who owe you a    great debt of gratitude.       Keep up the good work!!       Mahalo Nui Loa,       Alan           The new site is great.       I like it a lot better than the old site.         Thanks !!       Steve           Hi Mike,       I really appreciate the e-updates on the aviation industry.        Unfortunately, maybe fortunately,    I was recalled to active duty as part of a security force.       I'm living in another country for the next year or two, depending on the manpower needs.        The closest airport is about three hours away.        It may be hard for me to accumulate hours while I'm in the ""recall status.""       Please keep sending the e-updates.        The information is very useful.       Proudly Serving,       Bill           Mike,       You're doing a great job.       Bill           mike-       how are you?        i just wanted to let you know that your website is very helpful and informative.        i will certainly recommend it to anyone i know who is wanting to interview with an airline.        i am currently working on my cfi to build my hours, and as soon as i can get an interview,    i will certainly post my interview experiences.        keep up the good work.       thanks,       ed           Mike,       I just wanted to write you a quick note to thank you for the service that you do for pilots.        I am a young pilot with a little over 1000hours TT and I am overwhelmed with interviews    and what to study for interviews.        I have found the gouges to be very helpful!       Thanks       Marty           Your work is greatly appreciated, and your attitude is what we all need to get through    this difficult time.        Thanks and have a Merry Christmas!       Frank           Keep up the great work and have a great 2002!!        Fly safe and often!!        Erik           Thanks again for the emails and the website...       it is greatly appreciated...       I am learning alot since I am in flight training and with all the info received at your    site I will one day succeed in becoming a regional airline pilot...       Sincerely,       Dimitrios           Hey Mike,       Thank you for updating the information on the interview gouges.        I believe what comes around goes around.        Someone helped me out and I hope the info I gave can benefit others.        Keep in touch!       James           Mike, thanks for your efforts!..        they're much appreciated by me..        Dan           Thank you for this website.        You have provided a priceless assistance for my worksearch.        Although I was not hired by either Airtran or EJA, I would not have been prepared for    their interviews.            Every now and again you run into a web site that you really helps you out.         I'm a CFII who's now hell bent on getting my ME time together so I can join the interview    scene in the spring.         Not only does your site give me the scoop on what I need to be studying, but it also    lets me know how much time I need to be competitive.         Thanks for doing such a great job.       Regards,       Christopher            Hey Mike just wanted to say a quick thanks for the updates and keeping such a great and    helpful site running.         For alot of us flight instructors who are just trying to get our foot in the door and are    living on instructor wages can't afford to pay for a site like this, I can speak for    myself a quite a few of my friends when I say we really do appreciate it.              Mike,       I would just like to say thanks for creating and offering what has become the best    gouge/interview site available.         You have surpassed other sites (namely Will Fly for Food), and as a furloughed pilot right    now inches away from an interview with ChiEx, I've been visiting your site regularly   - and it seems as if there is always something new.           Mike,       Great job, I appreciate all the information.        Rex            Great site.        Thanks for not only putting it together but for updating and upgrading it often.        The e-mail alerts are very helpful.           Hi MIKE        U are doing a gr8 job KEEP IT.        Happy Landings        Khalid            Hey Mike, excellent site.        Thank you for your efforts and the time you have taken to make it the best site I've been to.         I will surely let my aviation friends know about it and I will post after I interview.           Mike,       I love the website that you have put together.        I have recomended it to most of my fellow pilots.......most of which have not heard of it yet.       Thanks Again       Christian            Thanks for the update Mike.        The site is now working great.        I have an interview in three weeks.        I'll let everyone know how it went.        Thanks for putting together a great site!        John            I've never mentioned it but I just wanted to say thanks for setting up this site.        It feels good to know that with interviews getting started again things may look    positive somtime soon.       Roger           Thank you for all your work on the website.         Hopefully I will be going to somje interviews soon and will be able to send some POSITIVE    experiences back.       Duffy            Mike,        I just want to say this is a great web sight and you    are doing a great job.       Neil           Thanks for setting up your website.........I have an interview with ASA. The only gouge I've    been able to find that's up to date is on your website, so THANKS!!!!!!     I'll be sure to send in my experience after it's all over.   Thanks again!           Dear Mike:   Just a note of thank you to you for all of your inspiration these past few months.     You have been a positive influence for me during these tough times!       I got an email from the Usairways Commuter saying I may have a definite class date by this Wednesday!     I will keep you posted.         Thanks so much!           I think your web site is great and very helpful to those of us trying achieve to ultimate goal of being hired.     As of today, I personally have not had any problems loging in or obtaining the information you generate.     Once again, thanks for the free access to such valuable information.            I think your website is wonderful, and you are doing an excellent job of helping your fellow pilots advance their careers.     Keep up the good work.       Michael           Thanks for the great site and all the updates...    You're doing a great job and I'm sure everyone appreciates it!!    Kepp up the great work and fly SAFE!!!       Erik            Thanks for the information and for what it is worth, I would pay for a site this good.        I probably would not have gotten the job I have now had it not been for the information from this site.        Keep up the good work and best of luck!       Paul           I'd like to thank you for putting out such a helpful web-site,        it has been a great help in keeping current on what's going on in the airline industry, as slow as it may be.       Mike           Thanks so much for this site.       It really is a big help.           Thanks for the great site.         I understand the need for $$ support.         I'm getting ready to apply once again for several commuters.         I appreciate the excellent gouge and related info.         Keep up the good work.         Scott            Thanks much for all the work you've put into the site.         When I get hired at a regional, I'll be sure to post my experience.         As a starving flight instructor and pilot,        I do enjoy things that are for free,        and hope the pay-for-access doesn't apply to me or doesn't end up costing too much.         Thanks again,       Chris           Thank you very much for the info!        Excellent job you are doing for us job hungry pilots.           Mike,       Thanks for all the work you've put in, to make this website successful.        It is truly a great help to anyone going for an interview.       Thanks Again       Christian           Dear Sir,       Thanks.  Your service is great.         I am about to retire from the Army as a UH-60 pilot with over 4000 hours, commercial instrument rotary wing, and will finish my commercial mutli-engine in the next two months.         I can not wait to start interviewing for my next career.       Thanks for providing a great benefit to me and many others       Ronnie           Mike,       Just wanted to say thank you for your website....       If you didn't have it, I would have fallen flat on my face at the ASA interview....it helped greatly....       moreover, I'm telling everyone who has an interview about your site...       Which is quite alot with all the furloughs going on.         Again, thank you very much!!!!       Sincerely,       Mark           Just wanted to say thank you for helping us all out.         This msg board really is a great help.           Thank you for having the best aviation employment site on the web.         I just got a job on the ERJ 145.         The gouge was dead on.         Airinc was a complete waste of money.           I just wanted to thank you for the wonderful information presented on this site.        It has given my fellow pilots and I a great resource and abundance of information in    preparing for aviaiton interviews for a number of different companies.       You should be very proud of what you have composed.       Any comments back would be greatly appreciated.       Thank You Very Much,       Jeff           Hi Mike,       Thanks for all the great info.         I know me and the other low time guys/gals can have a better chance at getting a job becuase of your site.         Not to mention it being free, for a CFI this is the best in the world!!!                 Send me your feedback!

I noticed you did the same for the other vandalized Flames image.   Also, is there a formal system for making such image history deletion requests? I haven't been able to figure it out so I'm asking you directly.  Kelvinc  ( talk ) 06:07, 5 September 2008 (UTC)     Hi Kelvinc. Sorry I was offline for a moment, I would have deleted it quicker than I did ;) but I deleted that version as you requested. In future instances, which are somewhat rare for vandalised images, I would make a request at  images for deletion  and say that you want a vandalised version speedily deleted and give some details about which version etc.  dvdrw  06:35, 5 September 2008 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Thanks!

I am glad you liked the little piece on  Sidney Eisenshtat . I couldn't decide if it was worth a DYK nom or not, especially since I have not nominated one of my own articles before.   Also thanks for the offer re the  rollback  button. I would be pleased to accept your offer--I would like to try to do my part.-- Arxiloxos  ( talk ) 00:29, 7 October 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Judenplatz   hi DVD, thanks a lot. I try my best to make good images that can be used, I'm not an expert and my camera sometimes fails me, but you gotta try. I was thinking about adding the map as well, I didn't do it because it's an older one (for example the monument is missing on it). The map can stay, maybe we should an explanation that it's a bit older (probably before WW2). But I agree, sooner or later we need to have a good map with explanations on it (maybe colour-coded with a legend). ciao  Gryffindor  08:08, 17 October 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Re: Israeli architects   Hi DVD R W, and thanks for the warm comments! I would really like to write more articles about Israeli architects, such as Mansfeld and Kahat, Dov Karmi, etc. However, unfortunately, information on them online is severely lacking, and I don't have any offline sources at the moment. The Hebrew Wikipedia is a good place to start writing, but it doesn't usually list sources, which makes it difficult to create decent articles which also comply with the English Wiki standards. As for DYK, I thought about it, but didn't come up with a single well-sourced fact I think would be interesting. You are welcome to nominate the article though :) DYKs weren't technically meant to be self-noms, when originally conceived. --  Ynhockey   ( Talk )  22:54, 19 October 2008 (UTC)     Hi again! No hard feelings about withdrawing the nominationyou might want to add the Knesset refs to the actual article though. Thanks for your RfA support :)   About Yaski vs. Yasky, I support  Yaski , as it seems to be the  common name ,  WP:HE -compliant, and also the preferred named by the firm, Moore-Yaski-Sivan Architects. The merge tag has been up for ages, so I don't see a problem with merging right now, but we can talk about this more if you believe that Yasky should be the proper article name. --  Ynhockey   ( Talk )  20:35, 24 October 2008 (UTC)   Follow-up: Apparently the tag hasn't been up for ages, I guess I confused it with another case from long ago. Thanks for noticing this, and let's merge the articles ASAP. --  Ynhockey   ( Talk )  20:54, 24 October 2008 (UTC)    You're right about the firm's site, guess I overlooked that because I distinctly remember them using an  i  in many real-life instancesdifferent departments maybe. Anyway, I still support the  i  spelling because the self-defined name is non-binding on Wikipedia, but at least this gives some weight to the  y  argument. I will merge/redirect to  i  right now (since you trust me :)), but we can analyze this further if you want. At the most, the article can always be moved back. --  Ynhockey   ( Talk )  21:02, 24 October 2008 (UTC)   Nevermind about the merge/redirect, apparently you already did it. Meanwhile, I created 2 redirects for Moore Yaski Sivan Architects :) --  Ynhockey   ( Talk )  21:05, 24 October 2008 (UTC)           [ edit ]   RfA   Hi again! Thank you very much for your support on the RfA and the warm comments. It passed today, so now I can start focusing on writing articles again :) Cheers,  Ynhockey   ( Talk )  21:03, 28 October 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Barnstar           The Userpage Shield       Thanks a lot for protecting my userpage from vandalism earlier this month.

Hello, I'm a computer science grad student at the UW doing some wikipedia research. We're kicking off a study on dispute resolution and were looking for a couple people in the Seattle area who might be interested in being interviewed. Would you be interested? Let me know!!! Thanks,  Leafman  ( talk ) 18:22, 3 November 2008 (UTC)   Thanks for considering me for an interview. Let me think about it, though honestly, I don't know if I have much to say about dispute resolution on Wikipedia. I find it an interesting topic to read about though.  DVD  23:40, 3 November 2008 (UTC)   Sure, sounds good, just let me know. Thanks again,  Leafman  ( talk ) 23:54, 3 November 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Ely Jacques Kahn   My friend, I never forget a request (which is why it's been on my Talk forever). I have shot three of the buildings, but still need to upload. I'm not so happy with them, but they were the best I could do. The Squibb Building is razor thing, sandwiched between two other buildings. Film Center is massive, so I there's a tiny area cut off. Universal Film is okay. Will put them here when they are uploaded, and you can choose. Best,  David   Shankbone  10:51, 25 November 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   All the best in 2009!

However, it will not be displayed properly by some email clients which poorly support CSS.  Maximum Compatibility $256 This package provides the  maximum possible compatibility  with different email clients, however, it has one disadvantage, namely a bulky HTML code which uses the font tag and inline styles. Please note  that since most email applications have limited CSS support, we always offer a  table-based  markup with styles, limited by the CSS 1 standard, without using background images. For such markup, all the CSS styles are always put inside the HTML code (inside the body tag). The markup, performed by us, for the email clients conforms to  HTML 3.2 standard . Before ordering email template development, please make sure that your design conforms to the markup restrictions for email, which are stated above, and that it doesn't contain background images. If you have any difficulties with defining it, please don't hesitate to contact us; we will be happy to help you. Require More Options? Specify layout and compatibility options.

Used extensively by so-called ""psychic spies"" during the Cold War for classified military projects, it has a long history both as an intelligence gathering tool and as the subject of research and applications in the civilian world. Remote viewing has now taken a long step into the public domain with the formation of a professional association to propose standards, test performance, and promote peaceful use and development of this unique human mental capacity.

The current exhibition presents early works from the 1980s, including A woman and her doctor (1980/81), Doorpusher (1984), The Smoker (1986), The Thinker, (1986) and The old prison (1987).

Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (October 2008)         Computer Gaming World       Computer Gaming World  Issue 249 - March 2005       Editor   Jeff Green       Categories   Computing ,  Gaming       Frequency   Monthly       First issue   November 1981       Final issue   Number   November 2006  268       Company   Ziff Davis       Country   United States ,  Canada       Language   English       Website   CGW on the 1UP Network       ISSN   0744-6667       Computer Gaming World  ( CGW ) was founded in  1981  by  Russell Sipe  as a bimonthly publication. Early issues were typically 40-50 pages in length, written in a newsletter style, including submissions by game designers such as  Joel Billings  (SSI),  Dan(i) Bunten  (Ozark Software), and  Chris Crawford . As well, early covers were not always directly related to the magazine's contents, but rather featured work by artist Tim Finkas. In 1986, CGW increased its publication cycle to 9 times a year, and the editorial staff included well-known writers such as Scorpia,  Charles Ardai , and M. Evan Brooks.   In late 1987, CGW introduced a quarterly newlsetter called Computer Game Forum (CGF), which was published during the off-months of CGW. The focus of the newsletter was game design, game hints and scenarios, and game development. The newsletter never really took off and only two issues were published (Fall 1987 and Winter 1987) before it was cancelled. Many of the columns which debuted in CGF, such as Scorpion's Tale and The Rumor Bag, were incorporated into CGW, which went monthly in 1988.   The magazine went through significant expansion starting in 1991, with growing page counts reaching 196 pages by its 100th issue, in November 1992. During that same year, Johnny Wilson became Editor-In-Chief, although Russell Sipe remained as Publisher. In 1993, Sipe sold the magazine to  Ziff Davis . Sipe continued on as Publisher until 1995. The magazine kept growing through the 1990s, with the December 1997 issue weighing in at 500 pages. In 1999, Wilson left the magazine and George Jones became Editor-In-Chief, at a time when print magazines were struggling with the growing popularity of the Internet. Jones' time at the head of the magazine was largely undistinguished, and he was replaced by  Jeff Green  in 2002.   On  August 2 ,  2006 , Ziff Davis and Microsoft jointly announced that  Computer Gaming World  would be replaced with  Games for Windows: The Official Magazine . [1]  The final CGW-labeled issue was November 2006, for a total of 268 published editions.   Simultaneously with the release of the final CGW issue, Ziff Davis announced the availability of the CGW Archive. The Archive features complete copies of the first 100 issues of CGW, as well as the 2 CGF issues, for a total of 7438 pages covering 11 years of gaming. The Archive was created by Stephane Racle, of the  Computer Gaming World Museum , and is available in PDF format. Every issue was processed through  Optical Character Recognition , which enabled the creation of a 3+ million word master index. Although Ziff Davis has taken its CGW Archive site offline, the magazines can be downloaded from the  Computer Gaming World Museum .   On  April 8 ,  2008 ,  1UP Network  announced the print edition of  Games for Windows: The Official Magazine  had ceased, and that all content will be moved online. [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Content   2   Circulation   3   Awards   4   Games for Windows: The Official Magazine   5   See also   6   Notes   7   External links               [ edit ]   Content   CGW  featured reviews, previews, news, features, letters, strategy, and columns dealing with  computer games . While  console games  are occasionally touched on, these are primarily the territory of CGW's sister magazine  Electronic Gaming Monthly .   In 2006, two of the most popular features were  ""Greenspeak"" , a final-page column written by Editor-In-Chief  Jeff Green , and  ""Tom vs. Bruce""  a unique, ""duelling-diaries"" piece in which writers  Tom Chick  and Bruce Geryk logged their gameplay experience as each tried to best the other at a given game.  ""Tom vs. Bruce""  sometimes featured a guest appearance by Erik Wolpaw, formerly of  Old Man Murray .   For many years, CGW never assigned scores to reviews, preferring to let readers rate their favorite games through a monthly poll. Scores were finally introduced in 1994. However, beginning in April 2006,  Computer Gaming World  stopped assigning quantifiable scores to its reviews. In May of the same year,  CGW  changed the name of its review section to Viewpoint, and began evaluating games on a more diverse combination of factors than a game's content. Elements considered include the communities' reaction to a game, developers' continued support through patches and whether a game's online component continues to grow.   The reviews were formerly based on a simple five-star structure, with five stars marking a truly outstanding game, and one star signalling virtual worthlessness. On very rare occasions, immensely abysmal games have been reviewed:  Postal  by Robert Coffey,  Mistmare  by Jeff Green, and  Dungeon Lords  by Denice Cook, three games which ""...form an unholy trinity of the only games in  CGW  history to receive zero-star reviews.""     [ edit ]   Circulation   According to  MDS   Computer Gaming World  had a circulation of slightly above 300,000 as of 2006. In this regard, it was slightly behind industry arch-rival  PC Gamer . It should be noted, however, that magazine circulation numbers are highly subjective, despite the seemingly straightforward connection between publication and distribution.     [ edit ]   Awards   In  1988 ,  CGW  won the  Origins Award  for  Best Professional Adventure Gaming Magazine of 1987 . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Games for Windows: The Official Magazine   On  August 2 ,  2006 , Ziff Davis Media issued a  press release  detailing their plans to halt circulation of  Computer Gaming World . As part of a joint-venture project with Microsoft, Ziff Davis launched a new magazine dubbed  Games for Windows: The Official Magazine  in Fall of 2006. The new magazine replaced  CGW  as part of Microsoft's Games for Windows initiative. In their press release, Ziff Davis indicated that much of  Computer Gaming Worlds's  core content and staff will be transferred to the new magazine. Because of these announcements, Ziff Davis' actions appear more on the order of a rebranding of  CGW , rather than an actual cancellation. It remains to be seen whether this strategic marketing alliance will prove useful to both parties involved.

clueweb09-en0011-63-18563	"           Science and Technology   Computer Programming         Programming     Computer programming (often shortened to programming or coding)  is the process of writing, testing, and maintaining the source code of computer  programs. The source code is written in a programming language. This code may be  a modification of existing source or something completely new, the purpose being  to create a program that exhibits the desired behavior. The process of writing  source code requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge  of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.     Earliest Programming     The earliest programmable machine (that is a machine whose  behavior can be controlled by changes to a ""program"") was Al-Jazari's  programmable humanoid robot in 1206. Al-Jazari's robot was originally a boat  with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at  royal drinking parties. His mechanism had a a programmable drum machine with  pegs (cams) that bump into little levers that operate the percussion. The  drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by  moving the pegs to different locations.     (More at  Computer  programming Wiki )   Brief Overview of Programming       Ever since the invention of Charles Babbage's difference    engine in 1822, computers have required a means of instructing them to perform    a specific task. This means is known as a programming language. Computer    languages were first composed of a series of steps to wire a particular    program; these morphed into a series of steps keyed into the computer and then    executed; later these languages acquired advanced features such as logical    branching and object orientation. The computer languages of the last fifty    years have come in two stages, the first major languages and the second major    languages, which are in use today.

Anybody want to pitch in to help me buy the assets?  Could be fun.                                       Posted on November 22, 2008 at 01:48 PM   |   Permalink                                         TrackBack          TrackBack URL for this entry: http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/1138361/36110070      Listed below are links to weblogs that reference  Steelbox and Netversant go under :                                                  Comments                                            Anixter takes a big hit with Netversant going under to the tune of 22 mil    i've got a crisp $20 to put in the pot for steelbox             Posted by:    Paul/Griffon Systems |     November 22, 2008 at 03:17 PM                            Ugh!  It's a conspiracy.  Steelbox had a fresh spin on the network based video architecture.  Sorry to see them go. Hopefully the guts are sold to a company that can bring it to market.        Who should take their place on the short list?  Where can we look for the high performance ""virtual matrix""?  Will it be IP based or will it be an HD version of the traditional matrix switcher?  -mica             Posted by:    Mica Millbach |     November 25, 2008 at 01:09 PM                          Steelbox' product was garbage. The New York City Transit Authority purchased 36 of these units along with a DMSS for each, and had nothing but problems. After a multitude of firmware updates, visits by their field engineers, and failures in the field, they wished they had gone with another vendor such as Nice or Teleste. It is not surprising that the company is now closed.

It’s Nancy Pelosi who would lead the effort to change the tax codes/rates/etc. It would be up to the president to sign, veto or pocket veto the bill.   Frankly, Obama seems reasonable to me, however, i am not a fan of Nancy Pelosi or the current House.                                       5       Dirk Diggler              October 27, 2008 at 11:03 pm                       That vid sucked.                                       6       Rose              October 30, 2008 at 10:06 am                       Go Obama.

The 262-megapixel mosaic (24,168 x 10,864 pixels) took two weeks to complete, including 30 hours of computing power and manual retouching for the final version. Avinash Arora, the guy who did it, tells us about the process.        Star Wars Last Supper                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Jess Daz: What materials did you use for creating this huge thing?  Avinash Arora: The 69,550-image collection I made is from all the movies. Originally I extracted EVERY image using vlc's image output plug-in from Episode IV, and used a photoshop programmed command to delete every 19 frames, and save the 20th. Only after that did I discover AndreaMosaic could do that for me, which saved me a ton of time in the other five movies. As the base, I used Eric Deschamps' Star Wars Last Supper painting done for Giant Magazine.   JD: What kind of computer did you use to do this?  AA: An Asus M2N SLI motherboard with AMD 5400+ X2, eVGA nVidia Geforce 8800GTS 640MB, and 2GB DDR2 Corsair XMS memory.   JD: What about the software?  AA: The original software I used is AndreaMosaic, but I found that the algorithm wasn't really producing the results I wanted. I ended up tinkering with the settings and producing dozens of sample mosaics to view, and I did some research and found out how it worked.   JD: Did you get what wanted at the end? What did you do to improve the quality?  AA: I created my own slightly modified algorithm to include pathlines of the strongest ""importance"" (or rather color distinction, so I could find pictures that followed the image's contours for every detail) I got more satisfying results. I kept tinkering with this one and made six full-size mosaics, until I finally settled on the last one...   JD: And that was that?  AA: No, I went to work on it by hand after that. I replaced at least a  thousand images  by hand that looked like they were out of place (my programming isn't perfect), and did some color corrections on others. The entire thing was done when I took sections and pieces from the mosaics I made with AndreaMosaic, my own matlab-based algorithm, and the original image I drew inspiration from, and put it all together in Photoshop (I also discovered that .psd files have a maximum size of 2GB, but luckily .raw files do not.)   JD: How long did it take you, then?  AA: Each movie's image extraction process took about an hour, that was the easy part. Each sample mosaic I made for testing took about 90 minutes. Each full mosaic I made took about 6-8 hours. Once I had the final mosaic and went to work, I'd say I put about 25-30 hours of work into touching up by hand.   The process (not including extracting the images from the movies) took me about two weeks from the time I made the first full mosaic, about a dozen samples, second full mosaic, dozen samples, etc.  During the two weeks I missed  all  but about two classes, and the day I finished I took an exam for a class I forgot I had...   JD: Geezuss...  AA: Don't worry, I still did well. :-)   JD: How big is the thing?  AA: Each image was about 640x272, but when placed into the mosaic they were shrunken down to 120 pixel wide. Each image is a full-quality jpeg, and they're cut up into folders (because my computer doesn't take too kindly to one folder with 69,550 files in it).   The final resolution of the image 24,168 x 10,864 pixels... 262 megapixels. Unfortunately I couldn't print it at the epic level I wanted to, which would have been a 5x11' composite, not a 3x6', and that would have been a 712-megapixel image. The guy who prints them says his computer is incapable of opening an image that large (which flattened would have been about 3GB... and uncompressed almost 40GB.)

The makers of Scrabulous have decided to  disable their game  for all North American users. Sniff.   This is the result of  a struggle with Hasbro  ( HAS ) and a suit filed against the Brothers Agarwalla—Scrabulous' founders—for violating copyright law under the  Digital Millennium Copyright Act .   Facebook Scrabulous vs Hasbro Scrabble   Fans of Scrabulous are now in an uproar. Don Reisinger of Masable says this move  makes Hasbro look stupid . The  official SCRABBLE® Facebook app  is littered with comments like, ""Boo, hiss. Way to alienate your corporation!"" and ""I'm going to extend my boycott to all Hasbro toys, etc."" And a campaign has been started on The Point, calling for Hasbro to  work with Scrabulous  instead of shutting it down (though there only 6 members as of this post).   This has led to a great deal of negative PR, especially  in the blogosphere . At a quick glance, I see a "" RIP Scrabulous "", a "" No, I Do Not Want to Play Scrabble "", and a "" F U, Hasbro. F U. ""   On the other side of the equation are people  defending Hasbro's actions . Or at least raising the issue of  copyright infringement as a business benefit : is it ""worthwhile to go after pirates, thieves, and copyright-infringers, or… simply let them be and consider it free advertising"", writes Sarah Perez of ReadWriteWeb.   And… I don't see that many other bloggers supporting Hasbro in my Technorati search. Oh well.   Let's Make a Deal   All of this drama makes you wonder why Hasbro didn't just offer to buy Scrabulous, right? Well, apparently they did. While Hasbro and Electronic Arts ( ERTS )  collaborated to build the new SCRABBLE® app , RealNetworks ( RNWK )—another company given the rights to create online Hasbro games—has been  working with Scrabulous   to ""bring the official Scrabble game to Facebook users"", writes Heather Timmons of the NY Times. (Funny, I thought that's what Hasbro and EA just did.) Furthermore, according to Peter Kafka of Silicon Valley Insider, an offer has been put out to & rejected by the Scrabulific Duo:    The hold up? Money. A source familiar with the negotiations say Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla want too much.   What's the gap? The brothers say they're generating $25,000 a month, or $300,000 a year in revenue. A 10x-20x multiple on that would make Scrabulous worth $3-$6 million, but for argument's sake let's say they'll have a hockey stick growth curve, and that their game project could be worth more than $10 million.   Sound fair? Maybe. But our source says the brothers want a ""multiple of several times that"" $10 million, and the four corporations they're negotiating with think that's ridiculous.    If that's true, then that's perhaps a bit optimistically presumptuous of the Brothers Agarwalla. $10M is a tidy sum for what is technically a copyright infringement.   Feeding Your Scrabble-Lust   In the meantime, to satisfy your Scrabble fix, you'll need to add the new  SCRABBLE® Facebook app  (or the  SCRABBLE beta Facebook app ; I'm not quite sure which one is the official official one). Unfortunately—oops— the app isn't working . Instead, you're slapped with a big fat ""We'll be back up shortly. We're working on some tech problems and Scrabble will be ready to play as soon as possible!"" message. This isn't their fault though. Alex Pham of the Los Angeles Times reports that this is the  result of a hacker attack . (Perhaps from some die-hard Scrabulous fans?)   A No-Win Scenario   All of this amounts to a major  catch-22  for Hasbro. Fighting against Scrabulous means loads of negative PR and possible damage to their business. Aligning with Scrabulous means setting a potentially damaging precedent to their business. (Yossarian lives!)   The Discussion Boards of both SCRABBLE apps are full of  rants  and  more rants . And just how many  pro-Scrabulous Facebook groups  are there? Over 500, with  Save Scrabulous  clocking in at over 47 thousand members so far (including me). Wow.   The Scrabble board game may have enjoyed a surge in popularity due to Scrabulous, though it's impossible to confirm this since Hasbro isn't releasing their sales figures. I wonder if those sales will drop with this negative fallout.   However, I totally understand Hasbro's actions against Scrabulous. If they supported Scrabulous, they may unleash a disastrous tidal wave. Say Hasbro purchased Scrabulous for $10M, this web business formula could have emerged:     Build an online version of a popular offline game   Gain spectacular popularity   ?   Sell out for millions   Profit     And if you didn't gain spectacular popularity, the offline game's parent company would probably just ignore you, like Hasbro has of  dozens of Scrabble knock-offs  already on the web. Lots of upside for very little downside! Dollars galore!   Either way, Hasbro is sure in a pickle. In that context, I can see why they'd opt to shut down Scrabulous. Months from now, as the public backlash dies down, Facebook users may begin adding the new SCRABBLE apps to quench their Scrabble thirst, and perhaps forget about this whole ordeal. It's possible. Take jetBlue, for example. Back in February 2007, a severe ice storm  took down over a thousand of their flights , leading to a major PR black-eye. Since then, they've rebounded from that episode. And if that's not a great example, take  Martha Stewart and the ImClone scandal  in 2004. Despite being jailed, she's back and arguably as strong as ever.   Hasbro could have handled the situation a little smoother though. But I doubt they had a web-savvy/social-media-savvy team of PR specialists on board (and if they did, WTF?). I would have recommended that they reach out to the community in some way. Maybe to solicit suggestions, maybe to implore an understanding. Even if people argued against them, just having a genuine public voice can sometimes earn a lot of empathy. At the very least, it could have softened the blow. This could have also come from Electronic Arts and RealNetworks, the makers of the online SCRABBLE apps.   Personally, I'm bummed as hell that Scrabulous is gone. I had quite a few games going there. I wish a compromise could have been reached, though I wouldn't have the foggiest how that would have looked.   R.I.P., Scrabulous.                 2 Comments      del.icio.us      Reddit      Digg      StumbleUpon                      Categories        Marketing   Social Media Marketing   Social Networking   Web            Related Posts        Scrabulous vs Scrabble, Round Two My Last Week Facebook Scrabulous vs Hasbro Scrabble Top 10 Reasons to Use Facebook Top 10 Reasons To Quit Your Job             2 Responses to ""Goodbye Scrabulous""                  MB  Says:              July 31st, 2008 at 4:44 am         The Agarwalla brothers have now put up a new Facebook game (actually a set of games) called Wordscraper.    One of the functionalities of this site is that you can configure your own board, and if you like you can make it work just like a Scrabble board.  There is a shortcut that allows you to make just one quarter of the board and then duplicate it over the remainder.  Then you can play on that configuration in new games indefinitely, as well as sharing your board with friends.  The rest of the game play is identical to Scrabulous.  Check it out:  http://www.new.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2521910901   The bottom line for lots of people is that they want to play internationally, and the official Scrabble games will never allow that, as it would require Hasbro and Mattel to collaborate.   Welcome back, Scrabulous… er, Wordscraper.                    Mike Lee  Says:              July 31st, 2008 at 8:16 am         Ah, thanks for the tip, MB! That's awesome news!

Chaired by Steve Bowbrick (from King of shaves), it flowed like social chat, with short sharp snipets of discussion and no powerpoint (which was nice).  I also had a good chat after with some guys from Emap, about RSS on the mobile. I seems that the only point is for the user and from a marketing point of view it's not great as you can't clickthrough to view the website.  I had a great talk with Ganesh Sivaraman from Nokia about how they are managing widgets on the new s60 handset, I was soooo relieved to hear they were using a web browser as a runtime for widgets, and even more so when he informed me they were using the now open source Webkit. They are also keeping the s60 browser open so Samsung, LG and the others can use it on their symbian platforms!!! So there has never been a better time to develope for Safari as the default browser (but I have been saying this for a while)!  Finally I talked with Jonathan Gabbai from Ebay about Apollo and Adobe's clever strategys.  On Thursday I started doing some Flash 8 development at work... which I have to say was painful in it's setup and the environment you have to work in, but once you get down to it, there isn't much between it and JavaScript, or even AS3. Later that evening I went for an 8k run around the common in preperation for the weekends 10k charity fun run.  Friday was quite normal, although I finially got my Blackberry from work. My first impressions are good, I had some problems with the scroll ball but then realised it just needed a clean (it was second hand). I think the most impressive things about it are the gmail and google maps applications and Opera mini, which is fantastic! On Friday night we went to a loverly Moroccan restaurant in Clapham where you could sit in a tent outside (tent lookin, wasn't really a tent). The food was interestin, especially when Em ordered fish (not really liking fish) and it came with the head and tail still on!  So today we had a 10k funrun to do (nothing fun about running that far)  around dullage park.  You can still  sponsor me  retrospectivly if you want :) Firstly doing 8k on Thursday was a bad idea, as was having shreddies and toast for breckfast. However it wasn't too bad once I had got past the stomach cramps, and ski sunday as a powersong was a live line. I managed to get around in 53:32 and counted 10.38km on my Nike+ thing!

At the very least, submitting the report means that someone at Autodesk has to deal with it - sort of like ""payback"" for being at least indirectly responsible for you possibly losing some of your work :-).                                posted by Matt Dillon at  8:50 PM                    0 comments                                                                                                Revit MEP 2009 - Coordinating Space Tags                                      Revit MEP 2009 now allows you to create your own Space objects in the MEP model for use in heat and cooling load analysis, rather than having to rely on Rooms that are derived from the architectural model. If you link an architectural model into your MEP model, you can use the Space tool to place MEP Spaces wherever the architect has placed rooms, giving you full and independent control over the upper limit offset and other analytical properties. The problem is, the Space Tag that is added to the Space has no obvious relationship to the original architectural room name or number. The Space has it's own name and number! Rather than manually editing the Space properties to match the room name and number (and running the risk that either the room name or number could change in a subsequent reload of the architectural model), you can make a simple edit to the Space Tag family to keep the Space and Room in sync. Select one of the space tags in your model and select the ""Edit Family"" button from the Options tool bar. (Don't worry if you've never edited families before and the thought of entering the Family Editor sends shivers of fright up and down your spine - this is EASY). Once in the Family Editor, you might want to do a ""Save As"" to keep your new tag separate from the original. Then simply select the ""Space Name"" label and click on the ""Edit Label"" button on the Options bar. In the Edit Label dialog box, remove the ""Name"" label from the pane on the right and replace it with the ""Room Name"" value in the pane on the left. (Your dialog box should look like the figure below). Repeat the steps above to replace the ""Number"" label with the ""Room Number"" property. Save the family and load it into your project. Select the space tags in your model and use the Type Selector to replace them with your new family. Viola. Done. And... even better - since they're actually reflecting the room names and numbers of the linked architectural rooms, if the values change on a subsequent reload of the architectural model, the space tags in the MEP model will automatically update to reflect those changes.                                posted by Matt Dillon at  6:06 PM                    3 comments                                                            Thursday, June 26, 2008                                            Shaan Hurley Brings the Infamous Matt Murphy Clay Head!

This year all of my classes are ""repeats"": Schedule Anything in AutoCAD Architecture or AutoCAD MEP  (3.5 Hour Class) All in the Family: Creating Parametric Parts in Revit Architecture  (90 Minute Class) Revit Architecture for AutoCAD Architecture Geeks  (90 Minute Class) I may also be helping Paul Aubin out as a lab assistant for his 3.5 hour lab on Revit Families. Or maybe I'll just be a bouncer... At any rate - I was trying for a bit lighter load this year and I was rewarded with exactly the number of classes that I was hoping for, which means that I might actually be able to attend a few myself for a change!                                posted by Matt Dillon at  7:02 PM                    0 comments                                                            Thursday, April 03, 2008                                            Rendering Examples from Revit Architecture 2009                                      Just a little model I started playing with in Revit Architecture 2008 and imported into Revit Architecture 2009. Here is the rendering output from Revit 2008: Here is the same scene rendered in Revit 2009 (after updating some of the materials - note especially the difference in the water!).  I should have postprocessed this with the exposure controls in Revit 2009 to brighten it up a bit but I was lazy. Which was stupid, because it only takes a few seconds. Here's an example of an interior scene rendered with 2009 before adjusting the exposure contols (no radiosity solution needed, by the way - this is done with the new Mental Ray engine, which is a breeze to use). And here is the same image after adjusting the exposure just a bit: What's most impressive about all this is that I really don't have much of a clue as to what I'm doing in this new rendering engine yet. I played around with the new materials library and editor a bit, and pushed a couple of buttons in the new Render dialog and viola! It's a breeze!                                posted by Matt Dillon at  10:39 AM                    1 comments                                                            Thursday, March 06, 2008                                            Rendering Changes in Revit 2009                                      The Revit 2009 products have a lot of nice enhancements in them - some of them seemingly minor, but with a huge impact, such as being able to dimension to a point or override dimension text. However one that will be noticed in a big way (and hopefully a positive one) is the new rendering engine and interface. When you move to the ""Rendering"" tab of the Design Bar you will now have two tools - ""Modify"" of course, and ""Render View"". Selecting this button will bring up the new Render dialog box, which has all of the settings for rendering in one place. Revit now uses the Mental Ray rendering engine, bringing it more fully into standardization with other Autodesk products, and in my opinion, providing for much more realistic and compelling images while at the same time simplifying the rendering process.  In addition to the revamped interface and rendering engine, the render properties editing and interface of material dialog has been revamped with an asset browser built in. There is a huge library of pre-configured material templates and types added.

Go take a read at: David Koch's AutoCAD Architecture New Features Overview in ""The Arhitect's Desktop""                                posted by Matt Dillon at  7:27 AM                    0 comments                                                            Wednesday, February 13, 2008                                            Automated Keynoting in Autodesk Revit                                      I am frequently asked about the keynoting feature in Autodesk Revit; how to use it and how to set it up. Its actually quite simple, and with a little bit of effort can reward you with a much-simplified annotation system, whether you actually use keynotes (reference or sheet) or simply want standardized typical text notes. The following tutorial will attempt to walk through the process of using keynotes. Then well take a look at how to customize them. This tutorial will use the standard keynotes file that ships with Revit Architecture (as well as Revit Structure and Revit MEP). Associating the Keynotes File Before you can use the keynoting feature in Revit, you must first associate your project with a keynotes file. You can do this in your template project if you want to use an office standard keynotes file, or you can use a separate file for each project. To associate a keynotes file, go to  Settings->Keynoting . The first item in the dialog is the path to your keynotes file. Note in the figure below that it is currently reflecting the default keynotes file, which should be located in your Imperial or Metric Library. This is a simple text file which can be edited or created from scratch, as we will see later. Figure 1  the Keynotes Settings dialog Note the other settings in the keynotes file. Most importantly we will discuss the difference between the numbering methods By sheet and By keynote later.  Assigning Keynotes to Materials and Types Once youve associated the keynotes file to your project or template you can begin to assign keynotes to material definitions and element types. Note in figure 2 and 3 that both the Material Definitions dialog (on the Identity tab) and the Type properties of any element have a field for a Keynote to be assigned.  Figure 2  the Material Definitions dialog, with the Identity tab selected. Figure 3  the Type Properties dialog of a wall type.  Additionally, the Family Types dialog of a component family definition will allow the assignment of a keynote to any component or detail component family. Selecting the browse button in the Keynote field in any of these dialogs will take you to the associated keynote file, allowing you to select from any of your standard notes. Figure 4 shows the default Imperial keynote file, which is structured around the 16 division CSI format.  Figure 4  The default Imperial keynotes file. So, now youve associated a keynotes file to your project and youve assigned keynotes to your materials and type definitions. The hard part is done.  Using Keynotes  To use keynotes, go to the drafting panel and select the Keynote tool. You have three options: Element:  Pick an element and the keynote assigned to the type definition will be used. Material:  Pick an element that has materials assigned to its components and the keynote assigned to the material definition will be used. User:  Pick any element. Whether or not it already has a keynote assigned to it you will be taken to the keynotes file to select any other keynote that you prefer to use.  If you select an element or material that has no keynote assigned to it yet, youll also be sent to the keynotes file to select a note. Once selected, that keynote will then be assigned to the element or material that you selected for future picks. If you accidentally select the wrong keynote during this process, you need to edit the type (or material definition) properties and change the keynote assignment there.  Referring back to the keynotes settings dialog box shown in Figure 1 again, note that you can choose to use By sheet  or By keynote when you place keynotes. The difference between these is simple but significant. By sheet refers to a system where each keynote is assigned a number that is unique on a particular sheet, however the same keynote could be a different number on a different sheet. Typically the numbers will simply be 1, 2, etc. By keynote is a system where the actual keynote number specified in the keynotes file will be used, and will be consistent for a given keynote across all sheets. The terms By sheet and By keynote refer to the US National CAD Standard Sheet Keynotes and Reference Keynotes, respectively. Figure 5 shows a detail annotated with the By keynote (reference keynotes) option. Figure 6 shows the same detail annotated with the By sheet (sheet keynotes) option. Figure 5  A detail annotated with the By keynote option.  Figure 6  A detail annotated with the By sheet option.  Note that with the sheet keynotes, the actual keynote number is not assigned; instead there is a simple ? placeholder. The number will be assigned when the detail is actually placed on a sheet. You can actually switch an entire projects details from the reference keynotes option to the sheet keynotes option by simply switching the choice in the Keynotes Settings dialog. All existing keynotes in your project will update immediately to the new system.  Keynotes are essentially nothing more than tags. You can choose to use a tag definition that displays the keynote number, or you can choose to use one that displays the keynote text itself. Therefore, even if you dont use keynoting as an annotation method, you can still use this feature in Revit to standardize and automate your text annotation.  Creating Keynote Legends  Keynote legends are nothing more than a schedule view. To create them, however, you need to go to the View pull down menu and select  New->Keynote Legend ; you wont find the option on the View design bar. Once the legend is created, youll see it listed in the Project Browser with the rest of your schedules. Viewing the properties of the legend, youll see, in fact, that it has the same structure as any other Revit schedule with one critical exception. On the Filter tab there will be an option at the bottom to allow you to filter keynotes by sheet, as in figure 7. Figure 7  filtering keynotes by sheet.  Turning this option on will allow you to have all of your keynotes in one keynote legend. However you can use the legend on multiple sheets. For each sheet that you place it on, only those keynotes that appear on the sheet will be shown in the legend. If you are using sheet keynotes, the keynote number will be blank in the legend view, since each one can vary from sheet to sheet, but when the legend is placed on the various sheets the numbers for those sheets will be assigned.  Thats it. Thats all there is to working with keynotes. The critical thing to make it move fluidly and quickly is to take the time to assign keynotes to all of your component family types and system family types, as well as your material definitions. This means that you will probably also need to either edit the default keynotes text file or create a new one. Read on&  Customizing a Keynote File   Although keynote files are nothing more than simple text (.txt) files, the best tool to use to create or edit them is actually a spreadsheet editor such as Microsoft Excel. The formatting is a little ugly in the raw text form, but much more readable in spreadsheet form. When you open the file in Excel (well use the default Imperial keynotes file as an example), make sure to set the file type in the File Open dialog to all so that you can see .txt files. After selecting the file, choose the Delimited option in the Text Import Wizard, and select Next. In the next screen, select Tab as the delimiter; you should see a preview of the file in the same dialog box.  Once the file is opened in Excel, you should notice that there are three columns. The first column is the actual keynote number for each note (or the section header for a group of keynotes). The second column is the keynote itself or the header text. The third column is a reference section  it is the section number that the keynote in that row falls under. This is how the keynote file can appear to cascade in the keynote dialog box. Looking at figure 8, lets examine this a bit closer. Figure 8  a partial view of the default Imperial keynote text file Notice the entry for 01530.A1. The keynote text for that entry will be Temporary Dustproof Partition. It will fall under the section 1500  Temporary Facilities and Controls  note the reference to section 1500 in the far right column for the keynote. Section 1500 will, in turn, fall underneath Section 1000, Division 01  General Requirements, because its far right column includes a reference to that section. Rows that do not include a reference in the far right column will be considered top-level headers.  Its that simple. After editing the file, make sure you save it back to .txt format, not .xls, and youre ready to go!  Thats all there is to Revit keynoting  create/modify your keynote file, associate it to your project or template, assign keynotes to your type and material definitions, and start annotating!                                posted by Matt Dillon at  9:38 AM                    2 comments                                                            Friday, February 08, 2008                                            Achtung!

If so, you might want to check out a handy little free utility that a co-worker turned me on to earlier this week, called ""ZoomIt"". It runs resident in your system tray and allows you to ZOOM to a specific area of your Windows screen, and also to mark up and draw, using CTRL keys. Hitting ESCAPE when done restores your original screen and removes any markups. WAY more effective than a laser pointer, and if you're like me, safer for your students as well!

He received a  BA  from  Yale College  in 1971 and studied  psychology ,  linguistics  and  computer science  as part of an interdisciplinary major in  Cybernetics . Kapor served as Music Director and Program Director at Yale's radio station  WYBC-FM   During the 1970s, Kapor was employed as a  radio   disc jockey  at WHCN-FM, a commercial  progressive rock  station based in  Hartford ,  Connecticut . It was also in this period that he became interested in  Transcendental Meditation , going on to teach the philosophy in  Cambridge, Massachusetts  (where he also worked as a low-level  computer programmer ) and  Fairfield, Iowa . In 1978, he graduated with a Master's degree in  counseling   psychology  from Campus-Free College (later renamed  Beacon College ) in  Boston . Kapor subsequently began a career as a  mental health  counselor at  New England Memorial Hospital  in  Stoneham, Massachusetts . [ 2 ]   In 1980, Kapor left his counseling career to attend the  Master's of Science in Management  program at the  MIT Sloan School of Management , but did not graduate.     [ edit ]   Lotus   Kapor founded  Lotus Development Corporation  in 1982 with  Jonathan Sachs , who was responsible for technical architecture and implementation, and created Lotus 1-2-3. Kapor served as the President (later Chairman) and Chief Executive Officer of Lotus from 1982 to 1986 and as a Director until 1987. In 1983, Lotus' first year of operations, the company achieved revenues of $53,000,000 and had a successful public offering. In 1984 the company tripled in revenue to $156,000,000. The number of employees grew to over a thousand by 1985.   Lotus' first product was presentation software for the  Apple II  known as Lotus Executive Briefing System. Kapor founded Lotus after working as head of development at  VisiCorp  (the marketers of VisiCalc) and selling the rights to his products; VisiPlot and VisiTrend to VisiCorp.   Shortly after Kapor left VisiCorp, he and Sachs produced an integrated spreadsheet and graphing program. Even though IBM and VisiCorp collaborated on  VisiCalc  for the PC and VisiCalc shipped simultaneously with the PC, Lotus had a superior product. Lotus released  Lotus 1-2-3  in January 1983. The name referred to the three ways the product could be used, as a spreadsheet, graphics package, and  database manager . The latter two functions were less often used; 1-2-3 was the most powerful spreadsheet available. Sales were enormous, turning Lotus into the largest independent software vendor in the world almost overnight. The business plan had called for $1 million in sales in the first year, and the actual results were $54 million.   Kapor was also the fundamental architect of the ""free-form"" database application,  Lotus Agenda .   In October 1984  Jim Manzi  was named President, and in April 1986 he was named as  CEO , succeeding Mitch Kapor who had become inactive in the company.     [ edit ]   Electronic Frontier Foundation   In 1990, with fellow digital rights activists  John Perry Barlow  and  John Gilmore , he co-founded the  Electronic Frontier Foundation , and served as its chairman until 1994. The EFF is a non-profit civil liberties organization working in the public interest to protect privacy, free expression, and access to public resources and information online, as well as to promote responsibility in new media.     [ edit ]   Mozilla Foundation   Kapor has been the Chair of the  Mozilla Foundation  since its inception in 2003. He founded the  Mitchell Kapor Foundation  to support his philanthropic interests in environmental health. He also co-founded, and is on the board of, the  Level Playing Field Institute , a  501c(3)  dedicated to fairness in education and workplaces. Kapor was the original Chair and is currently on the Board of Directors of  Linden Lab , a  San Francisco -based company which created the popular virtual world  Second Life , and a member of the Advisory Board for the  Wikimedia Foundation . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Other startups   In 1990, Kapor's new company  On Technology  introduced their new product  On Location,  an application designed for the Macintosh that contained an indexing system that permit quick retrieval and display of text on the Mac's hard disk. [ 4 ]  ""We think we're being cagey by bringing it out on the Mac first,"" Kapor said. [ 4 ]  ""It's a richer medium than MS-DOS, and if we have a hot product in the Mac market, it will be easier to get into the PC market."" [ 4 ]   In 2001, Kapor founded the  Open Source Applications Foundation , where he worked on  Chandler Project . His involvement with the Foundation and Project  ended in 2008 .   In 2006, Kapor founded his latest startup,  Foxmarks , based in San Francisco.     [ edit ]   Personal life   He is married to  Freada Kapor Klein  and resides in  San Francisco .

Full Story: http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-9995253-83.html?tag=txt  UPDATE: Sorry about the audio quality. Basically he called up a Manhattan Starbucks that is slated for closing and asked a worker for employee names and other information under the guise that they would get $75 from the Last HOPE Foundation because they are victims of downsizing. Despite his smooth talking and official-sounding organization he failed to get any information because the worker was a substitute from another store and didn't know anything. However, there is a lot to learn from his techniques. His asking her if she understands that she won't be eligible for any funds because she is not being laid off is pretty funny.

(Yes, a penguin.) AOL says it’s hard to communicate all the in’s and out’s of targeting because they’re technical.    “Are people going to stop and read a detailed technical explanation?” said Jules Polonetsky, the chief privacy officer for AOL. “When they just want to get their mail?”                                                                                                                                         E-mail this         Print         Share          Linkedin      Digg      Facebook      Mixx           Permalink                                            Online Marketing ,                         ad targeting ,  advertising ,  AOL ,  Data Collection Events                                      Related Posts                    From Bits         How Do They Track You?

But I use the Adblock Plus extension for Firefox and banned cookies from most of the large ad servers, so it’s probably too late for them to convince me anyway.             — JD                                                   2.            March 10, 2008  6:00 am        Link                                     Firefox also has a nifty extension (plug in) called “Track Me Not”, which basically dilutes your real searches by automatically doing bogus searches for you.    The information being stored about you is becoming less relevant because your real searches (which might reveal who you are / what your interests are) drown in the sea of unreal searches Track Me Not does for you and it would be impractical (probably even imossible) to divvy your searches up into real and fake search enquiries.             — Max Schneider                                                   3.

March 10, 2008  9:04 am        Link                                     Unlike most people, I seem to be frustrated by how irrelevant to me the ads I usually get are, and have given up clicking them.    I actually want to buy things on the web and if there were a form I could fill out stating in what areas I wanted to see ads, particularly from small and foreign companies I might not be aware of, I would gladly do so. Most of what I am interested in (documents and books on the history of diamonds prior to 1980 for example) is pretty esoteric, but the probability of my actually purchasing, if not now, then in the future, is perhaps gratifyingly high.   What the web really needs is a good, and well-known “Target Me With the Following Types of Ads” site with a section for “right now” and another for “permanently until further notice”.    I can’t understand why Google or Firefox hasn’t offered this option. It would make my life a lot easier. Ever figured out how much work you have to do to find a book containing data on South West African Diamond production from 1908 to 1940?  Eaaaaaaagh!

Why do they believe they will get better results by being sneaky?     This is all very 1984 - think how easily the government, under the patriot act, can get hold of all of your preferences, fears, hopes, etc.  Imagine what use the nazis or KGB could have made of such intelligence.

Clicking on them isn’t necessary because at some level the advertiser is getting name exposure.  I do click on ads to help support sites I use often.

Visiting *any* website that has an ad on it will usually result in your behavior being tracked by at least 1 of the major ad companies. You do not have to interact with the ad at all. Also, doing a search on any major search engine will likewise provide behavioral advertising ammunition.             — John Q                                                   19.

To (in order of appearance): Matt Cutts, Matt McGee, David, Mihm, Greg Sterling, Will Scott, Andrew Shotland, Michael Jensen, Martijn Beijk, Jen Chin (aka Mapsguide Jen), Ahmed Farooq, Rand Fishkin & Miriam Ellis: Thanks!   I have really enjoyed the many contributions highlighting 2008 in local search. The process has been fun and informative. It has provided an incredible range and depth of articles from an incredible range and depth of people.   For those of you that have missed some of these articles you may read them  here . For those of you that follow local closely, you will find some gems. For those of you that don’t and want an overview of an exciting year, it’s all there.        1. Particular postions, points or places  2. Centers of activity, attention, or concentration                        Comments (4)                                              Locai 2008- Miriam Ellis - Most Important Search Pieces in 2008        Category:  Google Maps (Google Local) ,  Local Search ,  Loci - Important Articles for the Year  – Mike 6:00 am               Miriam Ellis, along with her husband, operates Solas Web Design, a  web design & local seo company  focusing on the small business marketplace. She writes frequently on small business issues at her blog,  SEO Igloo . When she isn’t writing on her blog or commenting here, you will also find herguest blogging, moderating and writing at:  Search Engine Guide ,  Cre8tive Flow ,  14th Colony  and  The Conscientious Home . Dang, no wonder I have never met her in person.      ****   Here we go, Mike:   In my opinion, these are the two most important local search pieces published in 2008:   http://blumenthals.com/blog/2008/08/04/ranking-factors-in-google-maps-cracking-the-code-smx-local/   http://www.davidmihm.com/local-search-ranking-factors.shtml   These two articles stand out in my mind as having been especially engaging:   http://blumenthals.com/blog/2008/09/18/google-maps-widespread-hijacking-of-business-listings-confirmed/   http://searchengineland.com/a-small-business-marketing-success-story-john-tuggle-guitar-teacher-13746   I know there are a ton of other articles I’ve really enjoyed, but my memory tends to hinge more on writers I’ve come to admire, rather than on specific pieces they’ve published. Over time, I’ve learned which authors publish work that most appeals to me, and I return to them again and again.   I will read anything written by you, Mike, by Greg Sterling, David Mihm or Matt McGee. I’ve really enjoyed getting to know Martijn Beijk a bit this year. I’m excited about Matt’s hyperlocal blog and have closely followed the Local and Small is Beautiful columns at Search Engine Land in 2008.   What I would love to see in 2009 is a focus from some of these great folks on how-to local articles and further case studies of successful small businesses. These are the topics that engage my interest most and I’ll put anyone in my feedreader who is writing about them!

Here are his favorites:  ***  Sure - here goes:     http://www.davidmihm.com/local-search-ranking-factors.shtml  from David Mihm   http://www.seomoz.org/blog/the-world-series-spidering-problem  from Will Critchlow   http://paulgraham.com/cities.html  by Paul Graham     Hope that helps!

He has created, sold and recreated significant local web properties several times over. I communicate almost daily with him about his and my activities and I have found no one to have a better handle on the technical and social issues that confront local nor a better idea on how to build honest businesses within the space. From where I sit, his youthful influence and creative vision makes him the person to watch in the coming years. He writes at his blog, Tech Soapbox.  *********   No particular order.   1.  http://www.davidmihm.com/local-search-ranking-factors.shtml  - All in all, one of the best articles to start at with local search. Any time a friend asks for help in local search - this is what they get.   2.  http://www.davidmihm.com/blog/general-marketing/local-seo-citation-is-new-link/  - After they are done with the previous link, this is what they get next. I think it really sums up local optimization - get cited and you will succeed.   3.  http://blumenthals.com/blog/2008/10/30/microsofts-listing-in-google-maps-hijacked-oops-by-me/  - As a company, my thinking seems to be going towards the popular grain (no longer a fan of reviews or most UGC). Mike found an excellent example on how UGC is far from perfect.   4.  http://blumenthals.com/blog/2008/08/04/ranking-factors-in-google-maps-cracking-the-code-smx-local/  - I’m fully expecting Mike to make this a bi-annual-updated presentation   5.  http://gesterling.wordpress.com/2007/10/16/no-yelpers-says-one-local-cafe/  - I absolutely stole this off of Greg’s list, but it kind of underlines what I was trying to say with Mike’s hijacking of MS. It became even more pertinent after the entire Proposition 8 skirmish on Yelp (and I actually agreed with Yelp removing those reviews).   6. The various posts on Google Mapspam. What makes it sad is that the payday spam is still there - hell, one of the businesses listed for ‘cash advance new york city’ is a parking page!   7.  http://blumenthals.com/blog/2008/12/16/in-the-trenches-the-reality-of-smb-marketing-bruces-sew-handy-interview/  - kind of smacks the DIYers (of which I am one of) in the head.   8.  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/business/media/22carr.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&partner=rss&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1229965464-/0AeK+vUHW2muJIXWmFHcA  - I really like this one - kind of about focusing on your strength, not your weakness.   9.  http://gesterling.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/google-lbrr-going-out-of-business/  +  http://www.smallbusinesssem.com/google-local-business-referrals-is-shutting-down/1377/  - I’m surprised no one mentioned this. It was a potential black eye for Google, but every one seemed to have moved on quickly about it.   10.  http://www.localseoguide.com/botw-local-greg-hartnett-interview/  - the established SEOed sites are coming. Trust me, I know. Prepare for local data dilution like you could have never imagined      11. No story specifically, but where-o-where are Yahoo and MSN? I think Yahoo’s accomplishment in local this year was releasing data by a company they bought out.   12.  http://blumenthals.com/blog/2008/12/17/merchant-circle-has-trouble-getting-it-right/  +  http://blumenthals.com/blog/2009/01/09/why-google-has-trouble-getting-it-right/ - MerchantCircle and Google (!) start astroturfing on blogs. Mike is pretty tech-savvy and keeps a keen eye on commentators - how many other blogs have been hit by such comments? It kind of speaks for how big online local is becoming when people start pull such behaviour.                        Comments (0)                                         January 12, 2009       Loci 2008 - Maps Guide Jen shares highlights of 2008        Category:  Google Maps (Google Local) ,  Local Search ,  Loci - Important Articles for the Year  – Mike 6:25 am               The inestimable  Maps Guide Jen , Google Map’s not very public face, has agreed to share her highlight in Local from 2008. If I were Google, I would turn Jen loose to be their voice in Local.   *****   Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share some picks for 2008. Matt did a great job weighing in on some of our spam fighting efforts, and pointing out articles like Danny Sullivan’s and your own posts on “ Google Local Business Hijacking ” and “ Google Maps Hijacked .” These efforts certainly remain high in priority, as you’ll see within the list below, but I’ve also included some particularly relevant articles that speak to the successes of Google Maps last year.   1.  Spammers Hijack Top Florist Google Local Listings  - Cathy, FlowerChat (September 13, 2008)   Prior to this post, we’d seen spam restricted mostly to small-batch, low visibility businesses. Cathy’s alarm really exemplified the extent to which spam had begun to affect the lives of major business owners.   2.  Google Local Business Center adds custom category selection  - Erik Larkin, PC World (April 15, 2008)   Custom categories were a huge win for business owners with Local Business Center listings. We saw many debates over category selection and display; this change significantly curtailed concerns over categories.   3.  Evaluating Google’s Response to Maps Spam reports  - David Mihm, Sphnn (September 11, 2008)   We loved to see this public analysis of our own spam fighting efforts. We recognize that what we’re doing may not always be prominent, so we really enjoyed seeing the results of our efforts from David’s perspective.     4.  My experience using Google Local during a Medical Emergency  - Miriam Ellis, SEO Igloo Blog (November 4, 2008)   Miriam’s great, well-reasoned perspective showed us the perception of community edits in the SEO community. From later correspondence, we also recognized a few places to bump up the prominence of our contact forms, and display more information on how community edits affect the Maps index.   5.  Google hobbyists put ‘paan’ vendor on the map  - Samsanth Subramanian,  livemint.com  (October 16, 2008)   By featuring a couple enthusiastic users who are making a big impact through Map Maker, this article talks about how the wiki model for maps in India is working.     6.  Local Business Center Update - New Interface & Features  - Mike Blumenthal, Understanding Google Maps… (June 13, 2008)   This redesign cleaned up our interface to make it faster and easier for business owners to create, verify and edit their listings. We found that the changes cut down on a lot of confusion over verification, and how clicking on various buttons/links would affect a listing. As a result we saw a decrease in complaints about those processes.   7.  Report Spam on Google Maps  - Maps Guides & Google Users (July 10, 2008)   This isn’t really an article, but we’ve found it incredibly useful to have this thread where the public could see and respond to spam reports. We understand the scope of what users are concerned about, where the definitions of spam become fuzzy, and how spam reports change in nature as we filter out types of spam.      Honorary Mentions:   8.  Google Maps and YP - Comparing Oranges To…Tangerines  - Miriam Ellis, Solas Web Design (July 17, 2008)   9.  What is a Legitimate Review?  - Greg Sterling, Screenwerk (August 7, 2008)   10.  Local Users Bill of Rights  - Mike Blumenthal, Understanding Google Maps & Yahoo Local Search (June 7, 2008)                        Comments (5)                                              Loci 2008 - Martijn Beijk’s The year in Local Search 2008        Category:  Google Maps (Google Local) ,  Local Search ,  Loci - Important Articles for the Year  – Mike 6:00 am               Martijn has a background in the semantic and contextual webs and he brings that expertise to Local Search with a European perspective. Martijn iscurrently living in the Netherlands where he focuses on research and optimization at Onetomarket , a leading online marketing agency covering most of European markets. He writes at his blog,  Local Search Optimization  and makes “ guest appearances ” Stateside.   ****   The local search ranking factors, clearly one of the most extensive works I’ve seen in Local Search with many authorative voices on this topic, mad props for David!   http://www.davidmihm.com/blog/google/local-search-ranking-factors/     Cracking the code.

He has worked with some of the biggest and some of the smallest companies in the local search world. Andrew got his start in local seo when he was head of product & business development at InsiderPages where his biggest achievement was “losing two million monthly visitors overnight by screwing up the SEO”. He is a regular speaker at the Kelsey Group conferences. According to Andrew, his proudest SEO accomplishments are that he regularly ranks at the top in Google Image Search for “ soup nazi ” and “ larry craig “.   ****   The more time I spend in local search the more I am convinced its not much different from non-local search.  Sure there are maps and centroids and things like that, but thats what I read your blog for Mike!   Most of the following posts are not local-specific, but they are all relevant to anyone considering local marketing on the Web.   How Important is Branding to Search Engine Marketing?   Aaron Wall, SEOBook   This is one of those simple ideas that Aaron blurts out every other day that crystallized something I had been messing around in my brain for a while.  A quick read gives the impression that businesses with brands should spam the search engines because they can get away with it, but what it underscored for me was that any business, even a mom & pop, can redefine its brand through search.   Local Search Ranking Tactics   Steve Espinosa   Steve is a relatively new voice in local search and he quickly made a name for himself with this post.  No philosophy or rantings, just a nice meat and potatoes approach to improving the local rankings for your pages by clever cross linking and use of other sites authority.  Unfortunately Steves blog blew up a few days ago and the article no longer existed.  Good thing I liked it so much when he published it that I basically ripped it off on my own blog (no self-promotion intended).   Small Business Reputation Management   Matt McGee, SmallBusinessSEM   Lets face it, most small businesses are in the dark when it comes to online marketing.  Matts post on why its important to keep an eye on your business online profile is effective in its simplicity.  Most small guys are not going to take the time or spend the $ to do SEO or PPC right, but if you show them someone talking smack about them on Yelp, or show them that their contact info on a big Yellow pages site is out of date, they are going to want to do something about it.   Planet Chiropractic Blog   Michael Dourasch, Planet Chiropractic  Twitter: @chiropractic   Sometimes the best way to learn is to watch a star athlete do his thing.  Mike is a Santa Monica chiropractor cum search/social media junkie who seems to live online.  If you want to see want to see how a real small business guy who gets web marketing does it, you could do worse than to get all Web 2.0 with Mike.   Twitter: Ultimate Time Waster or Great Tool   Chris Winfield, 10e20   If you are hearing about this Twitter thing and how it might help your business, Chris presentation is one of the best around.   Twitter Case Study of a Commercial Non Big Brand   Rae Hoffman, Sugarrae.com   I love it when people show me step by step how it was done.  I often refer to Raes post about how her company used Twitter to build up a non big brands brand.  If you have a product or service that others need but dont know about, this one should be pretty inspiring.   Bits of Destruction   Fred Wilson, AVC.com   I could have picked almost any post by Fred.  He is great thinker and an even better writer.  This is one of his latest on the creative destruction brought about by the information age.  Every business, small and large, could benefit by thinking about the ideas he discusses here.  Oh yeah, and the guy has great taste in music too.

He has an  extensive background  in online local directories. He writes at his own blog,  Website Promotion is Not Vodoo , and does guest appearances elsewhere. In the New Orleans tradition he is both a gentleman and (at least after I called him out) a scholar and is a great sounding board. I can’t think of a better way to start off the new year than with Will’s great summary!   ****   Best of 2008 - Continuing Education in Local (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love the Blog)   I’m old and a little scatter-brained, so blogging doesn’t come easy for me.  We can’t all be as young at heart as Mike :).   So just one quick caveat, obviously this list isn’t comprehensive.  It represents who and what I read — who inform my understanding — and, to a great extent the work of my friends.

Dancing and music were never very far away,  It didn’t mean people were happy.  It meant that — not for all Cubans, but for many — dancing was the way they walked, and singing was the way they breathed.  It is still that way, which is one reason musically attuned visitors to Cuba today come home so excited.”   Ned Sublette  in  Cuba and its Music: From the first drums to the Mambo , 2004. Page 586.       Click to listen to Chris’s conversation with Bobby Carcasses. (15 minutes, 7 mb mp3)    “Decathlon-ist in art” Bobby Carcasses   We came to Cuba to get a weeks taste of what Brown students had a 4-month semester to absorb.  Their native guide, our mentor  Adrian Lopez Denis , implants in all of us the idea that the Revolution  even at its 50th anniversary  isnt the most interesting thing about Cuba, and Fidel and Raul Castro arent the most interesting things about the Revolution.  My own prejudice is that music beats sugar as the all-time expressive Cuban export; and that in Cuba the rumba feel of life will outlive and outrank the revolution in the long run.  So this first 15-minute introduction is with a master of Cuban jazz and dancehall music,  Bobby Carcasses .  Hes a singer who plays congas, and flugelhorn and alto saxophone.  Youll hear him say that in sports and in music he is a decathlon man — “a decathlonist in art.”  He drops other tell-tale bits of a Cuban musical profile: hes a religious man who believes in reincarnation, to begin with. He lives and loves Italian opera, Miles Davis, the blues and Bobby McFerrin — that is, his music has no categories of nation, style or the moment. He makes light of his anti-American Castro government, which suspected that jazz was a CIA trick. And he believes in a dark unexplainable genius  and geniuses  in music.  Duende  is the Spanish word for “these dark sounds,” as  Garcia Lorca  famously put it, “the mystery, the roots thrusting into the fertile loam known to all of us, ignored by all of us, but from which we get what is real in art.”     Bobby & Chris… Charles Hill Photo   This is the first of several posts from Havana — about the beat-up and tumble-down but all-the-more bewitching city itself, in conversation with the international architect Mario Coyula; also about a thrilling encounter with three American students at the Latin American School of Medicine — marking a sort of culmination of the civil rights revolution in the US and the most exalted Cuban vision of its own healing touch in a global healthcare emergency; and with Adrian Lopez Denis about a time coming when the US obsession with Cuba and Cuba’s obsession with its world role both fade — when fetishes give way to understanding and the unmistakable bonds of affections across the Straits of Florida.                        You can skip to the end and leave a response.

Keenly awaiting the rest. I had a friend, a devotee of Cuban music, who told me about meeting a drummer in Cuba in the 80’s — maybe even Bobby Carcasses. My friend asked him how many beats before he could gauge the skill of the drummer: “One.” A beautiful story on Cuba-related themes, Viva la Tropicana, in this book:   http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Monkey-New-Selected-Stories/dp/1562791206/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231259280&sr=8-1  Michaels a great writer.

In 1978 he invented VisiCalc, a simple way to do complex spreadsheets, and the world beat a path to not only his door, but also the door of Apple Computer.                         •  Spreadsheets - History & Introduction                         Everything you wanted to know about spreadsheets but were afraid to ask.                         •  VisiCalc                         Photo of screen capture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   By  Mary Bellis                           """"Any product that pays for itself in two weeks is a surefire winner."" - Dan Bricklin on VisiCalc                                       VisiCalc was the first computer  spreadsheet  program. It was released to the public in 1979, running on an  Apple II  computer. While most early microprocessor computers had been quickly supported by  BASIC  and a few games, VisiCalc introduced a new level in application software. It was considered a  fourth generation  software program. Companies invested time and money in doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, where changing a single number meant recalculating every single cell in the sheet. With VisiCalc, you could change any cell, and the entire sheet would be automatically recalculated.                                       ""VisiCalc took 20 hours of work per week for some people and turned it out in 15 minutes and let them become much more creative."" - Dan Bricklin                                       Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston invented VisiCalc. While a masters student in business administration at Harvard Business School, Dan Bricklin joined up with Bob Frankston to help him write the programming for his new electronic spreadsheet. The two started their own company, Software Arts Inc., to develop their product.                                       ""Early Apple machines -- don't know how to answer what it was like since there were so few tools. Just had to keep debugging by isolating a problem, looking at memory in the limited debugging (weaker than the DOS DEBUG and no symbols) patch and retry and then re-program, download and try again. And again..."" - Bob Frankston on programming VisiCalc for the Apple II                                       By the fall of 1979, an Apple II version of VisiCalc was ready, and the team started writing versions for the Tandy  TRS-80 , Commodore PET and the Atari 800. By October,  VisiCalc  was a fast seller on the shelves of computer stores at US $100.                                       In November of 1981, Bricklin received the Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in honor of his innovation. VisiCalc was soon sold to Lotus Development Corporation, where it developed into the  Lotus 1-2-3  spreadsheet for the PC by 1983. Bricklin never received a patent for VisiCalc. It was not until after 1981 that software programs were made eligible for patents by the Supreme Court.                                       ""I'm not rich because I invented VisiCalc, but I feel that I've made a change in the world. That's a satisfaction money can't buy."" - Dan Bricklin                                       ""Patents? Disappointed? Don't think of it that way. Software patents weren't feasible then so we chose not to risk $10,000."" - Bob Frankston on not patenting VisiCalc.                                       More On Spreadsheets                                                       In 1980, the DIF format was developed allowing spreadsheet data to be shared/imported into other programs, such as word processors, making spreadsheet data was more portable.                                             Also in 1980, SuperCalc was introduced, the first spreadsheet for popular micro OS called CP/M.                                             In 1983, the popular Lotus 123 spreadsheet was introduced.

I didn’t much care until I ran across the news that Rick Warren calls his critics “Christophobes.”  I take exception to that. I am not phobic of Christ, but of his followers. I am in fact, a Rickophobe. [...]                                                                                       SHAM- How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless by Steve Salerno.

clueweb09-en0003-62-23624	            I am Matt Thomas.      An enigma, wrapped in a paradox, inside a jelly donut.                                      One Last Word        December 22, 2008        Hard not to  agree with this :   “Gay marriage” turns the real issues of equal rights for sexual minorities upside down and paints us into a reactionary little corner of our own making. Yes, married people get special privileges denied to others. Denied not to just gays and lesbians, but to all others. Millions of straight people remain unmarried, and for a huge variety of reasons, from mothers whose support networks do not include their children’s fathers, to hipsters who can’t relate to religious institutions. We could be making common cause with them. We could be fighting for equal rights for everyone, not just gays and lesbians, but for all unmarried people. In the process we would leave religious institutions to define marriage however their members see fit.                  ℘  | Tags:  Bob Ostertag ,  gay marriage ,  Rick Warren  |  5 Comments                                                  Melissa Etheridge on what comes next        December 22, 2008        Melissa Etheridge at the  Huffington Post:   Brothers and sisters the choice is ours now. We have the world’s attention. We have the capability to create change, awesome change in this world, but before we change minds we must change hearts. Sure, there are plenty of hateful people who will always hold on to their bigotry like a child to a blanket. But there are also good people out there, Christian and otherwise that are beginning to listen. They don’t hate us, they fear change.                  ℘  | Tags:  gay marrige ,  Melissa Etheridge ,  Rick Warren  |  Opine                                                  Hodgman on Warren        December 22, 2008        John Hodgman with a  wake-up call :   THOSE OF US, however, who foolishly refused to take Obama at his word when he told us he didnt support gay marriage OVER AND OVER AGAIN must now take him at his deed. He really, really doesnt want gays to get married. SRSLY.    There were, I imagine, no small number of Obama supporters who hoped his conservative stance on gay marriage was a political calculation. Since Obama clearly has no problem with the damage done to his relationship with the gay community by sharing the stage with a bigot, it’s up to us to convince him as President that our issues are important ones, too.    And while I hate to disappoint those who did not support Obama and who are salivating at the idea of him falling out of favor with the left before he’s even been inaugurated, I don’t see it happening. We may not turn him around on gay issues. But I think that on balance, gays and lesbians—as well as the rest of us—will be better-off in four or eight years than we are now. And I think we’ll all be surprised by how quickly we achieve marriage equality in this country. I don’t necessarily suspect it will come during the Obama administration, but I do suspect that it will come.                  ℘  | Tags:  gay marriage ,  John Hodgman ,  Obama ,  Rick Warren  |  2 Comments                                                  Another one of those reasonable points        December 20, 2008        The inimitable Alan Cumming,  considering  what the gay community might do to even get the Rick Warrens of the world on board:   If he, and many other millions of Americans, cannot handle the word ‘marriage’ in reference to two men or two women, and if that is the only stumbling block to him being able to embrace equality and the end of prejudice against gays, then fine! Fine, Mr Warren, keep your ‘marriage!’    I’ve been undecided about civil unions vs. marriage for a long time. I understand the point of gays and gay activists who consider the civil union construct a separate-but-equal scenario. But racial segregation never was equal. Were US residents allowed a new social contract—a civil union—available to gay and straight couples alike, would inequality remain? And would we care? Marriage equality has come further in the past decade—my adult life—than I ever would have imagined. It’s hard to say that I’d give a damn if I had to settle for my dream civil union.                  ℘  | Tags:  Alan Cumming ,  civil rights ,  LGBT ,  marriage ,  Obama ,  politics ,  Rick Warren  |  Opine                                                  Regarding Rick Warren        December 20, 2008        Paul Jenkins with a a  reasonable take  on Rick Warren speaking at the Obama inauguration:   Barack Obama’s choice of Rick Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration is dreadful. His explanation is, if possible, even worse. He shrinks Warren’s grotesque comparisons down to a “disagreement,” as if we were talking about ethanol subsidies. But we are not. In fact, we are not even talking about marriage rights, we are talking about demonizing an entire group of Americans for the purpose of religious indoctrination, political gain and financial profit. Or doing so out of sheer hatred and idiocy. Or both.                  ℘  |  |  Opine                                                  Obama in Black and White        December 18, 2008          Time  presents a collection entitled  Obama: The College Years , photographs taken by amateur photographer Lisa Jack during Barack Obama’s time at Occidental College.     It’s very cool to see photos, nice but unremarkable for so many years, that now offer a little window into the personality of a really remarkable person.                  ℘  | Tags:  Art ,  Obama  |  Opine                                                  Art Direct Yourself        December 18, 2008        My Automattic colleague Noel Jackson has released a new plugin for WordPress called  Art Direction , now in beta:   Automation is the king of convenience. Its also a killer of creativity and quality & Web sites have gone from home-grown concoctions of HTML thrown together with bits of glue and tape,  to vast content management systems automating the entire process. Its lowered the barrier of entry for publishing on the Web, but its also sucked away the creativity.    Looks very interesting. More and more lately I find myself wanting to not just redesign but completely reboot iammattthomas.com. Noel’s providing me just that extra bit of provocation.                  ℘  | Tags:  Automattic ,  Design ,  Noel Jackson ,  WordPress  |  Opine                                                  The Visual Evolution of WordPress        December 18, 2008        Ozh has chronicled the  changes to the WordPress interface  over the past five years. I began using WordPress with version 2.0 (I was a Textpattern user before joining Automattic) and it was really interesting to me to see more of WordPress before the “big blue header.” When creating the visual design for the new “Crazyhorse” admin introduced in version 2.7, I took inspiration in part from the original, minimalist design of WordPress.                  ℘  |  |  Opine                                                  Maybe You’ve Heard        December 12, 2008        In all the excitement, I forgot to mention that  WordPress 2.7 “Coltrane” has been released . This is the second version of WordPress to which I’ve contributed, and it’s nice to be part of  the team . As of right now we’re closing in on  200,000 downloads , not to mention the nearly 5 million blogs powered by  WordPress.com . I’m very relieved and happy to see that  the reaction  has been very positive so far, and I’m looking forward to helping make it even better in version 2.8.                  ℘  | Tags:  Automattic ,  Design ,  WordPress  |  One Comment                                                  The new WordPress.com Dashboard        December 5, 2008        Tonight, Automattic  launched  the new “Crazyhorse” admin design on WordPress.com. The redesigned UI is one of the many features of the upcoming WordPress 2.7, and it’s a proud moment for all of us involved to get it in front of so many WordPress users at once. I’ve been running development builds of 2.7 on iammattthomas.com for many months; if you were waiting for a sign that that 2.7 is stable enough to install on your self-hosted WordPress blog, this would probably be it.                  ℘  | Tags:  Automattic ,  Design ,  WordPress ,  Work  |  Opine                                           ← Older posts                                                                  Journal   About this Site                          Entries RS S          Comments RSS                                                                Powered by  WordPress  and Booksmarts Vol. 2. by  Matt Thomas
