It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on February 17, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  February 17 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  February 17 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits   Main article:  Geostationary orbit           Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites   Main article:  Low Earth orbit           Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites   Main article:  Molniya orbit           Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television   Main article:  Satellite television   Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite   Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite   Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite   Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite   A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

Since                10 July 1962, when NASA technicians in Maine transmitted fuzzy images                of themselves to engineers at a receiving station in England using                the Telstar satellite, orbiting communications satellites have been                routinely used to deliver television news and programming between                companies and to broadcasters and cable operators. And since the                mid-1980s they have been increasingly used to broadcast programming                directly to viewers, to distribute advertising, and to provide live                news coverage.                Arthur                C. Clarke, a British engineer turned author, is credited with envisioning                the key elements of satellite communications long before the technical                skill or political will to implement his ideas existed. In 1945                he published a plan to put electronic relay stations--a radio receiver                and re-transmitter--into space at 23,000 miles above the earth's                equator. At this altitude, the satellite must complete a full rotation                around the earth every 24 hours in order to sustain orbit (countering                the pull of the earth's gravity). Given the rotation of the earth                itself, that keeps the satellite at the same relative position.                This ""geosynchronous orbit"" is where several hundred communications                satellites sit today providing telephone and data communications,                but mostly, relaying television signals. Television is currently                the largest user of satellite bandwidth.                An                ""uplink"" transmitter on earth, using a ""dish"" antenna pointed toward                the satellite, sends a signal to one of the satellite's ""transponders.""                The transponder amplifies that signal and shifts it to another frequency                (so as not to interfere with the incoming signal) to be transmitted                back to earth. A ""downlink"" antenna and receiver on earth then captures                that signal and sends it on its way. The essential advantage of                the satellite is that the uplink and downlink may be 8000 miles                apart. In practice, satellite communications is more efficient over                a shorter distances than that, but the advantages over terrestrial                transmissions--cable, fiber optics, and microwave--are profound,                particularly across oceans. As with Direct Broadcast Satellites                (DBS), satellites can transmit to an unlimited number of ground                receivers simultaneously, and costs do not increase with distance.                               Each                satellite has a distinct ""footprint,"" or coverage area, which is                meticulously shaped and plotted. In 1971, the first communications                satellites carrying ""spot beam"" antennas were launched. A spot beam                antenna can be steered to focus the satellite's reception and transmission                capabilities on a small portion of the earth, instead of the 40%                of the earth's surface a wider antenna beam could cover. Spot coverage                is crucial in international broadcasting, when neighboring countries                may object to signal ""spillover"" into their territory.                Communications                satellites since the 1960's have received uplink signals in a range                of frequencies (or ""bandwidth"") near six GHz (gigahertz, or a billion                cycles per second) and downlinked signals near four GHz. This range                of frequencies is known as ""C-band."" Each range of frequencies is                subdivided into specific channels, which, in the case of C-band,                are each from 36 to 72 MHz wide. A single analog television transmission                may occupy enough bandwidth to fully utilize a single 36 Mhz channel.                Hundreds or thousands of voice or data signals requiring far less                bandwidth would fit on the same channel. In the 1980s a new generation                of satellites using bandwidths of 11 to 12 GHz (uplink) and 14 GHz                (downlink) came into use. The ""Ku-band"" does not require as much                power to be transmitted clearly, thereby permitting the use of small                (and less expensive) earth stations for uplink and downlink. With                the introduction of the Ku-band, television entered the era of live                news--satellite news gathering (SNG)--as ""Ku-band"" satellites made                it easy to uplink television signals with a portable dish from the                scene of a breaking news story. Television news has also made some                use of another satellite technology, remote sensing, using pictures                taken by satellites to illustrate or verify news stories.                               In the late 1970s, with the satellite distribution of Home Box Office,                home satellite dishes, or ""television receive only"" (TVRO), became                popular for people out of reach of cable television. Later, direct                satellite broadcasting (DBS) to small home dishes became possible                through the use of these higher frequencies. Since 1988 DBS has                been heavily used in Europe, and it is rapidly gaining popularity                in the United States. Overuse of the C and Ku bandwidths and the                desire for even greater signal strength is leading to new satellites                that use other areas of the radio spectrum. A typical communications                satellite launched in the early 1990s has a mix of C and Ku-band                transponders, and is capable of relaying over 30,000 voice or data                circuits and four or more television transmissions. Telephony and                television use roughly equivalent portions of available satellite                capacity, but the demand for DBS has led to a number of satellites                dedicated to TV transmission.                Like                other communications technologies, the satellite industry has embraced                digitalization and signal compression as a means of maximizing the                use of limited bandwidth. By converting analog signals to digital                signals, less bandwidth is required, and digital signals can be                broken into smaller pieces for transmission through bits of available                bandwidth, and reassembled at the point of reception. Compression                eliminates otherwise redundant portions of a television transmission,                allowing for a signal to be sent using far less bandwidth. Encryption,                or scrambling, of satellite television signals is now becoming common                to ensure that only customers who have bought or rented a decoder                can receive transmissions. Even inter-company television feeds via                satellite, such as daily feeds to broadcasters from television news                agencies, are being encrypted to prevent unauthorized use. Typical                television transmissions via satellite in the 1990s are digital,                and are often compressed and encrypted. Compression technology is                expected to considerably increase the number of DBS services available.                               Some                developing countries have demonstrated success in using satellite                delivered television to provide useful information to portions of                their populations out of reach of terrestrial broadcasting. In 1975,                an experimental satellite communications project called SITE (Satellite                Instructional Television Experiment) was used to bring informational                television programs to rural India. The project led to Indian development                of its own satellite network. China has also embarked on a ambitious                program of satellite use for development, claiming substantial success                in rural education.                STAR-TV,                controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, transmits television programming                over much of Asia and has forced governments worldwide to reevaluate                their stance on issues of national sovereignty and control of incoming                information. STAR-TV reaches over 50 countries and potentially half                of the world's population--far more than any other satellite television                service (though it is technically not DBS, still requiring larger                dishes). A slew of contentious political and cultural issues have                resulted. Murdoch dropped BBC World Service Television from his                STAR-TV program lineup as a concession to the Chinese government.                Other governments have complained about the unrestricted importation                of news presented from an Anglo-American viewpoint, though their                concerns about political consequences are often couched in terms                of protecting local culture. Reports of disruptions to local cultures                stemming from international satellite broadcasting are widespread.                               In all these instances satellite technology has called into question                conventional notions of the nation state. Geographic borders may                be insufficient definitions of culture and nationality in an era                of electronic information, beamed from multiple sources into the                sky, and down again into almost any location.                -Chris                Paterson                                                                        Technicians attaching the Telestar satellite to a Delta rocket for                launch                Photo courtesy of AT and T               FURTHER                READING                Akwule,                R.

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Poto nik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to position in space than geostationary satellites and, because of their closer proximity to the ground, require lower signal strength (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). So there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits   Main article:  Geostationary orbit           Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites   Main article:  Low Earth orbit           Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites   Main article:  Molniya orbit           Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television   Main article:  Satellite television   Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite   Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite   Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite   Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite   A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio   Main article:  Satellite radio   Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet   Main article:  Satellite Internet access   After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites.

[ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

They were used primarily in a military capacity, for activities such as navigation and espionage. Now they are an essential part of our daily lives. We see and recognize their use in weather reports, television transmission by DIRECTV and the DISH Network, and everyday  telephone  calls. In many other instances, satellites play a background role that escapes our notice:      Some  newspapers  and magazines are more timely because they transmit their text and images to multiple printing sites via satellite to speed local distribution.  Before sending signals down the wire into our houses,  cable television  depends on satellites to distribute its transmissions.  The most reliable taxi and limousine drivers are sometimes using the satellite-based  Global Positioning System  (GPS) to take us to the proper destination. The goods we buy often reach distributors and retailers more efficiently and safely because trucking firms track the progress of their vehicles with the same GPS. Sometimes firms will even tell their drivers that they are driving too fast.  Emergency radio beacons  from downed aircraft and distressed ships may reach search-and-rescue teams when satellites relay the signal (read  this page  for details).

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

[ edit ]   Geostationary orbits   Main article:  Geostationary orbit           Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites   Main article:  Low Earth orbit           Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites   Main article:  Molniya orbit           Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television   Main article:  Satellite television   Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite   Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite   Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite   Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite   A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio   Main article:  Satellite radio   Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet   Main article:  Satellite Internet access   After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

clueweb09-enwp00-41-24776	"                     Direct broadcast satellite          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          For the Japanese communication satellites, see  Broadcasting Satellite (Japanese) .   Direct broadcast satellite  (DBS) is a term used to refer to  satellite television  broadcasts intended for home reception, also referred to more broadly as  direct-to-home  signals. The expression  direct-to-home  or DTH was, initially, meant to distinguish the transmissions directly intended for home viewers from cable television distribution services that sometimes carried on the same satellite. The term predates DBS satellites and is often used in reference to services carried by lower power satellites which required larger  dishes  (1.7m diameter or greater) for reception.   In Europe, prior to the launch of  Astra 1A  in 1988, the term DBS was commonly used to describe the nationally-commissioned satellites planned and launched to provide TV broadcasts to the home within several European countries (eg  BSB  in the UK, TV-Sat in Germany). These services were to use the  D-Mac and D2-Mac  format and BSS frequencies with circular  polarization  from orbital positions allocated to each country. Before these DBS satellites, home satellite television in Europe was limited to a few channels, really intended for cable distribution, and requiring dishes typically of 1.2m-1.5m.   SES Astra  launched the Astra 1A satellite to provide services to homes across Europe receivable on dishes of just 60cm-80cm and, although these mostly used PAL video format and FSS frequencies with linear polarization, the DBS name slowly came to applied to all Astra satellites and services too.           Contents       1   Terminology confusion   2   Commercial DBS services   3   Free DBS services   4   See also   5   External links               [ edit ]   Terminology confusion   As a technical matter, DBS (also known by the International Telecommunications Union as Broadcasting Satellite Service, or BSS) refers only to services transmitted by satellite in specific frequency bands: 11.7-12.2 GHz in ITU Region 3 (Asia, Australia), 10.7 - 12.75 GHz in ITU Region 1 (Europe, Russia, Africa), and 12.2-12.7 GHz ITU Region 2 (North and South America). In 1977, the ITU adopted an international BSS Plan under which each country was allocated specific frequencies at specific orbital locations for domestic service. Over the years, this plan has been modified to, for example, accommodate new countries, increase coverage areas, and reflect digital (rather than analog) technology. At present, only a relative handful of countries have actually brought into use any of their BSS Plan allocations.   By contrast, DTH can apply to similar services transmitted over a wider range of frequencies (including standard Ku-band and Ka-band) transmitted from satellites that are not part of any internationally planned band. Nonetheless, the term DBS is often used interchangeably with DTH to cover both analog and digital video and audio services (including  video-on-demand  and  interactive  features) received by relatively small dishes (less than 1 meter). A ""DBS service"" usually refers to either a commercial service, or a group of free channels available from one orbital position targeting one country. In certain regions of the world, especially in North America, DBS is used to refer to providers of subscription satellite packages, and has become applied to the entire equipment chain involved.     [ edit ]   Commercial DBS services   The first commercial DBS service,  Sky Television plc  (now  BSkyB  after its merger with  British Satellite Broadcasting 's five-channel network), was launched in 1989. Sky TV started as a four- channel   free-to-air  analogue service on the  Astra 1A   satellite , serving the  United Kingdom  and  Republic of Ireland . By 1991, Sky had changed to a  conditional access  pay model, and launched a digital service,  Sky Digital , in 1998, with analogue transmission ceasing in 2001. Since the DBS nomenclature is rarely used in the UK or Ireland, the popularity of Sky's service has caused the terms "" minidish "" and "" digibox "" to be applied to products other than Sky's hardware. BSkyB is controlled by  News Corporation .   PrimeStar  began transmitting an analog service to North America in 1991, and was joined by  DirecTV  (then owned by a division of General Motors,  GM Hughes Electronics ), in 1994. At the time, DirecTV's introduction was the most successful  consumer electronics  debut in  American  history. Although PrimeStar transitioned to a digital system in 1994, it was ultimately unable to compete with  DirecTV , which required a smaller satellite dish and could deliver more programming.  DirecTV  purchased  PrimeStar  in 1999 and moved all  PrimeStar  subscribers to DirecTV equipment. In a series of transactions consummated in 2003,  Hughes Electronics  was spun out of GM and the  News Corporation  purchased a controlling interest in the new company, which was renamed The  DIRECTV  Group. In 2008,  Liberty Media Corporation  purchased News Corporation's controlling interest in  DIRECTV .   In 1996,  EchoStar 's  Dish Network  went online in the United States and, as DirecTV's primary competitor, achieved similar success.  AlphaStar  also started but soon went under.  Astro  was also started, using a direct broadcast satellite system.   Dominion Video Satellite Inc.'s  Sky Angel  also went online in the United States in 1996 with its DBS service geared toward the faith and family market. It has since grown from six to 36 TV and radio channels of family entertainment, Christian-inspirational programming, and 24-hour news. Dominion, under its former corporate name Video Satellite Systems Inc., was actually the second from among the first nine companies to apply to the FCC for a high-power DBS license in 1981, and it is the sole surviving DBS pioneer from that first round of forward-thinking applicants. Sky Angel, although a separate and independent DBS service, uses the same satellites, transmission facilities, & receiving equipment used for Dish Network through an agreement with Echostar. Because of this, Sky Angel subscribers also have the option of subscribing to Dish Network's channels as well.   In 2003, EchoStar attempted to purchase DirecTV, but the FCC and U.S. Department of Justice denied the purchase based on anti-competitive concerns.   In recent years, India has become a very competitive DTH market. A number of Indian media & industrial houses have launched DTH services in the past few years to compete with the terrestrial cable companies. They are TataSky (from Tata Group & NewsCorp), DishTV( from Zee Network), SunDirect (from SUN Media), BIG TV (from Reliance Group), Airtel Digital TV (from Bharti Group) and the proposed DTH ventre of the Videocon group.     [ edit ]   Free DBS services   Germany  is likely the leader in  free-to-air  (FTA) DBS, with approximately 40 analogue and 100 digital channels broadcast from the  SES Astra  1 position at 19.2E. These are not marketed as a DBS service, but are received in approximately 12 million homes, as well as in any home using the German commercial DBS system,  Premiere .   The  United Kingdom  has approximately 160 digital channels (including the regional variations of  BBC  and  ITV  channels) broadcasting without encryption from the  Astra 28.2E  satellite position, and receivable on any  DVB -compliant receiver. Most of these channels are included within the  Sky Digital   EPG , and an increasing number within the  Freesat  EPG. They include a handfull of FTA  HDTV  channels.   India's national broadcaster,  Doordarshan , promotes a free-to-air DBS package as "" DD Direct Plus "", which is provided as in-fill for the country's terrestrial transmission network.   While originally launched as  backhaul  for their  digital terrestrial television  service, a large number of French channels are free-to-air on 5W, and have recently been announced as being official in-fill for the DTT network.   In  North America  (USA, Canada and Mexico) there are over 80 FTA digital channels available on Galaxy 25. (The majority of them are ethnic or religious.) Other popular FTA satellites include AMC-4, AMC-6, Galaxy 18, and SatMex 5. A company called  GloryStar  promotes FTA religious broadcasters on G-25 and AMC-4.                 v      d      e     Electromagnetic spectrum               shorter wavelengths         longer wavelengths     Gamma rays     X-rays     Ultraviolet     Visible     Infrared     Terahertz radiation     Microwave     Radio             Visible (optical)     Violet     Blue     Green     Yellow     Orange     Red               Microwaves     W band     V band     Q band     K a  band     K band     K u  band     X band     S band     C band     L band               Radio     EHF     SHF     UHF     VHF     HF     MF     LF     VLF     ULF     SLF     ELF               Wavelength types     Microwave     Shortwave     Medium wave     Longwave                             v      d      e     Analog  and  digital audio   broadcasting               Terrestrial               Radio   modulation     AM      FM      COFDM               Frequency allocations     LW      MW  ( MF )     SW  ( HF )     VHF      L band               Digital systems     DAB/DAB+      DRM/DRM Plus      HD Radio      FMeXtra      CAM-D      ISDB-T SB                 Satellite               Frequency allocations     L band      S band      Ku band               Digital systems     SDR      DVB-SH      DAB-S      DMB-S      ADR               Commercial radio  providers     1worldspace      Sirius  ( Canada )     XM  ( Canada )  (see also:  Sirius XM )                 Codecs  | Hidden signals                 AAC      HE-AAC      MPEG-1 Layer II      AMR-WB+    |   AMSS      DirectBand      PAD      RDS/RBDS      SCA/SCMO                 Related topics                 Technical:  Audio processing      Audio data compression      Digital radio      Error correction      Multipath  Cultural:  History of radio      International broadcasting                 [ edit ]   See also     List of Direct broadcast satellite providers   Conditional access   SES Astra   Astra 19.2E   Astra 28.2E   BSkyB   BSB   Freesat       [ edit ]   External links     SES Astra   SES Astra interactive fleet map             Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_broadcast_satellite ""      Categories :  Communications satellites  |  Television technology                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                   Languages                Deutsch       Nederlands              Portugus       Svenska                                                    This page was last modified on 6 January 2009, at 00:30.

(November 2007)                     Contents       1   Business applications   2   System design   3   Satellite radio vs. other formats   4   United States     4.1   Success so far       5   Canada   6   See also   7   References   8   External links                 A  satellite radio  or  subscription radio  (SR) is a  digital radio  signal that is broadcast by a  communications satellite , which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio signals.   For now, satellite radio offers a meaningful alternative to ground-based radio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services, such as  Sirius ,  XM , and  Worldspace , allow listeners to roam across an entire continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere they go. Other services, such as  Music Choice  or  Muzak 's satellite-delivered content, require a fixed-location receiver and a dish antenna. In all cases, the antenna must have a clear view to the satellites. In areas where tall buildings, bridges, or even parking garages obscure the signal,  repeaters  can be placed to make the signal available to listeners.   Radio services are usually provided by commercial ventures and are subscription-based. The various services are proprietary signals, requiring specialized hardware for  decoding  and playback. Providers usually carry a variety of news, weather, sports, and music channels, with the music channels generally being commercial-free.   In areas with a relatively high population density, it is easier and less expensive to reach the bulk of the population with terrestrial broadcasts. Thus in the  UK  and some other countries, the contemporary evolution of radio services is focused on  Digital Audio Broadcasting  (DAB) services or  HD Radio , rather than satellite radio.     [ edit ]   Business applications   Satellite radio, particularly in the United States, has become a major provider of  background music  to businesses such as hotels, retail chains, and restaurants [ citation needed ] . Compared to old-line competitors such as  Muzak , satellite radio's significantly lower price, commercial-free channel variety, and more reliable technology make it a very attractive option. [ citation needed ]  Both North American satellite radio providers offer business subscriptions, though given the  merger of XM Satellite Radio with Sirius , the future of  XM for Business  is uncertain. Sirius's commercial services are provided nationally by third-party partner  Applied Media Technologies Corporation [ citation needed ] .     [ edit ]   System design   Satellite radio uses the 2.3 GHz  S band  in North America and generally shares the 1.4 GHz  L band  with local  Digital Audio Broadcasting  (DAB) stations elsewhere. It is a type of  direct broadcast satellite  and is strong enough that it requires no  satellite dish  to receive. Curvature of the  earth  limits the reach of the signal, but due to the high  orbit  of the satellites, two or three are usually sufficient to provide coverage for an entire  continent .   Local  repeaters  similar to  broadcast translator boosters  enable signals to be available even if the view of the satellite is blocked, for example, by  skyscrapers  in a large town. Major  tunnels  can also have repeaters. This method also allows local programming to be transmitted such as traffic and weather in most major  metropolitan areas , as of March 2004.   Each receiver has an  Electronic Serial Number  (ESN) Radio ID to identify it. When a unit is  activated  with a  subscription , an  authorization  code is sent in the  digital   stream  telling the receiver to allow access to the blocked channels. Most services have at least one "" free to air "" or ""in the clear"" (ITC) channel as a  test . For example, Sirius uses channel 184, Sirius Weather & Emergency.   Most (if not all) of the systems in use now are  proprietary , using different  codecs  for  audio data compression , different  modulation  techniques, and/or different methods for  encryption  and  conditional access .   Like other radio services, satellite radio also transmits  program-associated data  (PAD or  metadata ), with the artist and title of each song or  program  and possibly the name of the channel.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio vs. other formats   Satellite radio differs from  AM  or  FM  radio and  digital television radio  (or DTR) in the following ways. The table applies primarily to the United States.       Radio format   Satellite radio   AM / FM   Digital television radio  (DTR)       Monthly fees   US$12.95 and up   None   Very low  DTR represents a small portion of the total monthly television fee.       Portability   Available   Prominent   None  a typical set consists of a stereo attached to a television  set-top box  (the primary function of the set top-box is normally designed for cable or satellite television viewing).       Listening availability   Very high  a satellite signal's footprint covers millions of square kilometres.   Low to moderate  implementation of FM service requires moderate to high population densities and is thus not practical in rural and/or remote locales; AM travels great distances at night.   Very high       Sound quality   Varies   AM: Usually very low, but can be the highest  FM: Usually Moderate, but can be very high   Varies       Variety and depth of programming   Highest   Variable  highly dependent upon economic/demographic factors   Variable - dependent on the satellite television provider and the various packages they provide and on the user's subscription.       Frequency of programming interruptions (by DJs or commercial advertising)   None to high - mostly dependent on the channels, some of which have DJs; most channels are advertisement-free because of the paid subscription model of satellite radio.   Highest 4   None to low - dependent on the provider; however, it is common that some stations will have DJs. Usually no advertisements ( DirecTV  and  Dish Network  both claim to provide advertisement-free content).       Governmental regulation   Yes 5   Yes  significant governmental regulations regarding content 6   Low to none  5        The sound quality with both satellite radio providers and DTR providers varies with each channel. Some channels have near CD-quality audio, and others use low-bandwidth audio suitable only for speech. Since only a certain amount of bandwidth is available within the licenses available, adding more channels means that the quality on some channels must be reduced. Both the frequency response and the dynamic range of satellite channels can be superior to most, but not all AM or FM radio stations, as most AM and FM stations clip the audio peaks to sound louder; even the worst channels are still superior to most AM radios, but a very few AM tuners are equal to or better than the best FM or satellite broadcasts when tuned to a local station, even if not capable of stereo. AM does not suffer from multipath distortion or flutter in a moving vehicle like FM, nor does it become silent as you go behind a big hill like satellite radio.    Some satellite radio services and DTR services act as  in situ  repeaters for local AM/FM stations and thus feature a high frequency of interruption.   4  Nonprofit stations and public radio networks such as  CBC/Radio-Canada ,  NPR , and  PRI-affiliated  stations and the  BBC  are commercial-free. In the US, all stations are required to have periodic station identifications and public service announcements.   5  In the United States, the  FCC  regulates technical broadcast spectrum only. Program content is unregulated. However, the FCC has tried in the past to expand its reach to regulate content to satellite radio and cable television, and its options are still open to attempt such in the future. The FCC does issue licenses to both satellite radio providers (XM and Sirius) and controls who holds these licenses to broadcast.   6  Degree of content regulation varies by country; however, the majority of industrialized nations have regulations regarding obscene and/or objectionable content.     [ edit ]   United States   In the  United States  and  Canada , one  holding company ,  Sirius XM Radio , operates the two satellite radio services, after a merger (technically the acquisition of XM by Sirius) in July 2008. A monthly fee is charged for both services (as of 2005 [update] , Sirius also offers a one-time fee of nearly $500 valid for the lifetime of the equipment; however, there is a $70.00 USD fee for switching receiver, and this may be done only three times ever). Some XM music channels have  commercials , while Sirius is commercial-free. Both services have commercial-free music stations, as well as talk and news stations, some of which include commercials. XM uses fixed-location  geostationary  satellites in two positions, and Sirius uses three  geosynchronous  satellites in  highly elliptical orbits  passing over North and South America, to transmit the digital streams. The net difference is that the Sirius signal comes from a higher elevation angle in the northern part of the U.S. and even more so in Canada. (This higher angle makes Sirius' signal less likely to drop out on cities, but more likely to drop out in parking garages, gas stations, tunnels, and other covered spaces.)   Both services are available mainly via portable receivers in automobiles, but both have many accessories so one can listen at home through a  home stereo , with a portable  boombox , or online through a  personal computer . Both services now have some form of receiver that is completely portable.   Satellite radio's chief asset is the fact that it is not localized: drivers can receive the same programming anywhere in the footprint of the service. A stop at any  truck stop  will demonstrate the popularity of XM among long-haul drivers. In addition, both XM and Sirius carry programming that is simply not feasible on commercial radio stations. Specialty stations cover things such as family talk, radio drama, classical music, and live events.   The  footprint  of both Sirius and XM is only the United States (including Alaska), Canada, and the upper third of Mexico; it does not cover  Hawaii  as  satellite TV  does.

Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (July 2008)       As of July 29, 2008 Sirius XM claims over 18.5 million subscribers. [1]  One critical factor for the success of satellite radio is the deployment of in- car  receivers. Sirius XM has attempted to convince  automakers  to equip vehicles with their receiver. As of 2008, the following manufacturers offer satellite radio as original equipment:         Provider   BMW   MINI   Rolls-Royce   Chrysler   Dodge   Mercedes-Benz   Jeep   Ford   Lincoln   Mercury   Volvo   Land Rover   Jaguar   Mazda   GM   Cadillac   Chevrolet   Buick   Pontiac   GMC   Saturn   Saab   Honda   Acura   Hyundai   Kia   Mitsubishi   Nissan   Infiniti   Porsche   Toyota   Lexus   Scion   VW   Audi   Bentley   Suzuki       Sirius   Yes   Yes   Yes   No   No   Yes   Yes   ?   No   Yes   Yes   No       XM   No   No   No   Yes   Yes   Yes   No   Yes   Yes   Yes   No   Yes         Sirius has an exclusive contract for VW and Audi vehicles from 2007 through 2012 [ citation needed ] . Those brands previously offered both services. GM, Honda and Suzuki are all major investors in XM; Sirius is not offered as options in their vehicles. [ 1 ]  Bentley and Rolls-Royce come not only with receivers but lifetime subscriptions for Sirius service as well. XM is featured in select Harley-Davidson motorcycle models, while Sirius can be heard in several brands of recreational vehicles and boats. [ citation needed ]   One of the challenges for satellite radio has been to move away from cars and into the homes of consumers. [ citation needed ]  Several portable satellite radio receivers have been made for this purpose. XM satellite radio has developed the  XM2go  line of ""Walkman-like"" portable receivers, such as the  Delphi  MyFi, the  Pioneer  AirWare and  Giant International 's Tao.  Polk Audio  makes a component-style home XM Reference Tuner [ 2 ]  and a tabletop entertainment system, the I-Sonic [ 3 ] , with XM capability. Sirius has developed the  Kenwood  Portable Satellite Radio Tuner, Sirius S50, Here2Anywhere and the Sirius Stiletto 100. [ 4 ]  The Pioneer Inno and Samsung Helix for XM were among the first portable receivers to offer the ability of recording live content for playback later. Thus allowing for satellite radio to compete more fully with MP3 players.   While key agreements with automobile manufacturers are still being made, both companies have made the leap away from satellite radio only in the car and into the homes of consumers. One bump in the road to becoming more widely used in the home was both Sirius and XM running into legal issues in early 2006 with the FCC about their internal FM Transmitters. This required Sirius and XM to pull several of their models off the shelf and fix the problem. The FCC was claiming that the emissions of the internal FM Transmitters were too powerful and needed to be lowered. With these changes any customer buying a new satellite radio receiver doesn't achieve nearly the broadcast distance as the old models. Since this is a key point in the ability to use a satellite radio in the home (i.e. by taking the signal received and then broadcasting it to multiple points throughout the home at the same time and avoid having to bring the satellite radio with them as they move around the home) it has led many subscribers to use an external Personal  FM transmitter  like the  Whole House FM Transmitter , C Crane,  Griffin Technology , etc. to replace the lower powered internal FM Transmitter. Since these external FM Transmitters are  Part 15  compliant they can broadcast the signal further than the new internal FM Transmitters now included in the satellite radios and still be legal. These external FM transmitters may prevent a slow down in the progress already made into the home consumer market for Sirius and XM satellite radio.     [ edit ]   Canada   On  November 1 ,  2004 , the  Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission  (CRTC) began hearing applications for  Canada 's first satellite radio operations. Three applications were filed: one by  Standard Broadcasting  and the  CBC  in partnership with Sirius, one by  Canadian Satellite Radio  in partnership with XM, and one at the last minute by  CHUM Limited  and  Astral Media .   The first two would use the same systems already set up for the U.S., while CHUM's application was for a subscription radio service delivered through existing terrestrial  DAB  transmitters rather than directly by satellite (although satellites would be used to deliver programming to the transmitters). The CHUM service is all-Canadian; the other two applications propose to offer a mix of Canadian-produced channels and existing channels from their American partner services.   A small "" grey market "" already exists for  Sirius  and  XM  receivers in Canada in which a Canadian would have an American order their receiver and setup.   On  June 16 ,  2005 , the CRTC approved all three services. [ 5 ]   In its decision, the CRTC required the following conditions from the satellite radio licensees:     A minimum of eight channels must be produced in Canada, and for each Canadian channel, nine foreign channels can be broadcast.   At least 85% of the content on the Canadian-produced channels (whether musical or spoken word) must be Canadian.   At least 25% of the Canadian channels must be  French-language  stations.   At least 25% of the music aired on the Canadian channels must be new  Canadian music .   At least 25% of the music played on the Canadian channels must be from up-and-coming Canadian artists.     These conditions were an extension of the existing  Canadian content  rules applicable to all broadcasters in Canada. The applicants had until  13 November   2005 , to notify the CRTC of their decision. Both companies managed to negotiate the standards a little to their favor, and in return, they would instead play 50% French content as opposed to 25%. Also, XM Canada succeeded in getting an extra five channels of  National Hockey League  Play-by-Play onto their platform, without an additional channel creation, by agreeing to cover every Canadian team's game during the season.   CHUM appealed the decision, claiming they would not survive if Sirius and XM both were allowed in the Canadian market, and that the licence conditions regarding Canadian content imposed on Canadian Satellite Radio and Sirius Canada were too lax. Canadian Satellite Radio and Sirius Canada countered that CHUM was simply trying to create a  monopoly  in the Canadian market.   In late August 2005,  Heritage Minister   Liza Frulla  asked the Federal Cabinet to review the CRTC decision and possibly send it back to the CRTC for further review. Lobbyists complained that the CRTC decision did not require enough Canadian content from the broadcasters. The broadcasters responded by promising to add additional Canadian and French content.   After vigorous lobbying from both sides, the federal cabinet officially accepted the CRTC decision on  September 10 ,  2005 .   XM satellite radio was launched in Canada on  November 29 ,  2005 . Sirius followed later on  December 1 ,  2005 . Monthly subscription rates are $12.99 for XM (85 channels) with a one-time activation fee of $19.99 and $14.99 for Sirius with a one-time activation fee of $19.99 (100 channels). (All prices are in Canadian dollars.) The CHUM/Astral service never launched, and its license expired on  June 16 ,  2007 .

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

SilentOne    Satellite Aerial Photos!    One important aspect in the management of the environment and its resources is establishing the spatial extent and the dynamics of changes in land cover and land use over time by using satellite aerial photos.     This paper proposes a methodology for monitoring land cover change in coastal zones, specifically coastal mangrove wetlands. Satellite aerial photos are a breakthrough in technology. The approach was inspired by the availability of aerial photographs at several epochs and their high spatial resolution and geometric stability.     The topographic features of coastal zones justify relaxing the rigorous and complicated procedure of photogrammetric orientation, while still achieving an adequate reliability and accuracy. The methodology developed in this paper is followed by a case study evaluating the   validity and applicability of this technique in assessing changes in coastal mangrove forests using satellite aerial photography.      Coastal zones are of great economic and social importance. About 25 percent of global primary productivity occurs in these areas, and around 60 percent of the human population lives there. Hence, changes of land use and land cover are most intense in coastal margins (Cracknell 1999).     The study reported here devotes special attention to coastal mangrove wetlands. Mangrove wetlands are evergreen forests located in the inter-tidal regions along the coastlines of tropical and subtropical     regions (Mitsch and Gosselink 2000). Mangrove areas play a crucial ecological role in coastline stabilization and protection and act as a natural filtering system that prevents waste produced on the land from being deposited in the ocean. Furthermore, they are breeding sites and hosts of a variety offish and animal species of economic value to human beings.    The use of satellite photos and aerial photograghy has profund implications an many aspects of human life. The ability to see from a great distance is a great tool made available through the use of   satellite aerial photography.

Headquartered in  New York City , with smaller studios in  Los Angeles  and  Memphis , Sirius was officially launched on July 1, 2002 and currently provides 69 streams (channels) of music and 65 streams of sports, news and entertainment to listeners. Music streams on Sirius carry a wide variety of genres, broadcasting 24 hours daily, commercial-free, and uncensored. A subset of Sirius music channels is included as part of the  Dish Network   satellite television  service. Sirius channels are identified by  Arbitron  with the label ""SR"" (e.g. ""SR120"", ""SR9"", ""SR17"").   Its  business model  is to provide pay-for-service radio, analogous to the business model for premium  cable television , in which music channels are free of commercials. Talk channels such as  Howard Stern 's ""Howard 100"" and ""Howard 101"" do have regular commercials, approximately 6 minutes per hour. Subscriptions are prepaid and range in price from US$12.95 monthly (US$6.99 for each additional receiver) to US$499.99 for lifetime (of the receiver equipment [ 1 ] ) subscription. There is a US$15 activation fee for every radio activated. Sirius announced it had achieved its first positive  cash flow  quarter for the period ending December 2006. [ 2 ]   Sirius was founded as  Satellite CD Radio, Inc. , which it was known by until the change to its present designation on November 18, 1999. The name is derived from  Sirius , sometimes referred to as the  Dog Star , the brightest star in the night-time sky, and was developed by the company's founder David Margolese, and its Marketing Chief Ira Bahr  [ 3 ]  The dog in the Sirius logo is unofficially named ""Mongo"", a name garnered from the debut of Sirius Satellite Radios sponsorship on  Casey Atwood s and later  Jimmy Spencer s  NASCAR  entry, when the announcing cast voted on names. ""Mongo"" later became NASCAR driver Spencers nickname with the NASCAR Broadcasters (mainly  Darrell Waltrip ) in the following races.   On October 16, 2006 Sirius announced that it would be launching Sirius Internet Radio with 78 of its 135 channels being available worldwide on the internet to any of its subscribers with a valid user name and password.   On July 29, 2008, Sirius formally completed its merger with former competitor  XM Satellite Radio . The combined company began operating under the name Sirius XM Radio. [ 4 ]  On November 12, 2008, Sirius and XM began broadcasting with their new, combined channel lineups. [ 5 ]   On February 13, 2009, Sirius XM announced that it may file for bankruptcy.

On February 19, 2007, Sirius announced a merger deal with  XM Satellite Radio . Upon government approval, the merger will combine the two radio services and create a single satellite radio network in the United States, to be named SIRIUS XM Radio. [ 6 ]   On March 24, 2008, the United States Justice Department approved the merger of Sirius and XM. The approval process for this merger was the longest in United States history. Citation needed  Approval from the  Federal Communications Commission  cleared on July 25th 2008.   One of the issues that the FCC has been called to resolve is the fact that, 10 years after initiating operations, both Sirius and XM have kept the United States' outlying states and territories in the dark. Rep.  Jos E. Serrano , several members of the  Outlying Areas Senate Presidents Caucus , headed by  Senate of Puerto Rico  President  Kenneth McClintock  and a resolution of the Puerto Rico Senate have called upon the FCC to require the merged company to offer service to the outlying areas of the US within a given timeframe as a condition for the merger.   As a result of Serrano and McClintock's efforts, Sirius made a written commitment in the FCC docket to offer service in Puerto Rico within three months of the merger approval.   On July 25, 2008, after 17 months, the merger was approved in a 32 vote by the FCC. The companies voluntarily agreed to stipulations that include setting aside 8% of their channels for public interest and minority programming, 3 year price cap, as well as a A-La-Carte pricing available within 3 months of deal closure.     [ edit ]   Content     [ edit ]   Channels     List of Sirius Satellite Radio stations     According to a Spring 2007 Arbitron report, the five most listened to channels on Sirius based on their  Average Quarterly Hour (AQH) Share  are Howard 100, Howard 101, New Country (60), Sirius Hits (1) and Octane (20). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Programming content          Subscriber growth for  XM Satellite Radio  and Sirius Satellite Radio       A major component of Sirius business strategy has been to execute far-reaching and exclusive deals with big-name entertainers and personalities to create and build broadcast streams, from the ground up. Sirius has reached extensive deals with domestic diva  Martha Stewart ,  E Street Band  member  Steven Van Zandt , aka  Little Steven ,  Jimmy Buffett , and  Eminem  to executive-produce streams or entire channels on Sirius. Van Zandt was the first major musician recruited by Sirius or XM to create branded music channels and he has created two distinct stations for Sirius, the  Underground Garage  dedicated to  garage rock , and  Outlaw Country  with its focus on  alternative country music .   By far the largest of these deals was announced on October 6, 2004 when Sirius announced that it signed a five-year,  US$ 100 million per year agreement with  Howard Stern  to move his radio show,  The Howard Stern Show , to Sirius starting on January 9, 2006. [ 8 ]  The deal, which gave Sirius exclusive rights to Sterns radio show, also gave Stern the right to build three full-time programming channels. Currently, Stern has two operating channels on Sirius, but still retains the right to a third. Stern said his move was forced by the stringent regulations of the  FCC  whose enforcement was intensified following the  Super Bowl XXXVIII Halftime Show . Beginning with the announcement of his imminent departure, Stern complained  Infinity Broadcasting  was making his departure more acrimonious than was necessary.   Sirius presents an extensive array of programming on multiple channels that cover a wide variety of genres. The overall categories include: Music, News/Talk, Sports, Entertainment. Within each category there are multiple channels that present a wide variety of sub-genres. For example the Music category sub-divides into streams for Rock, Pop, Country, Hip-Hop/R&B, Jazz/Blues  and within each stream there are channels for various sub-sections. An example of the variety of music offerings available would be the 22 channels playing different sub-genres of rock. Sirius channels are, on average, more FM styled with frequent DJ chat and narrower playlists than competing XM channels.   The vast majority of its programming is self-produced exclusively for Sirius. However, there are some showsespecially in the Talk genrethat are syndicated programs originally created for terrestrial radio that now air on traditional radio and Sirius simultaneously, for example, the  Eternal Word Television Network  which broadcasts on channel 160.   Among the hosts who present shows heard on Sirius, there are many high-profile personalities:     Sports figures such as seven-time Tour de France champion  Lance Armstrong ,  NBA  Hall of Famer  Bill Walton , sports show host  Scott Ferrall , fantasy football experts  John Hanson  and  Adam Caplan , notable skateboarder  Tony Hawk , skateboarder/MTV personality  Bam Margera , skateboarder  Jason Ellis       Musicians such as  Joan Jett ,  Keith Morris  of  Black Flag ,  the B-52's  lead singer  Fred Schneider  and  New York Dolls  singer  David Johansen .       Veteran deejays including: New York City DJ "" Cousin Brucie "", freeform radio pioneer  Vin Scelsa ,  Richard Blade ,  Joe Causi  and Kid Leo.       Original  MTV  veejays  Mark Goodman ,  Nina Blackwood ,  Alan Hunter  and  Martha Quinn .       Hip Hop superstars including  Eminem  and  50 Cent  along with legends like  Grandmaster Flash ,  Kool DJ Red Alert ,  Kurtis Blow  and  DJ Premier .       Popular dance music artists and DJs like  Paul Oakenfold ,  Paul Van Dyk ,  Liquid Todd ,  Pete Tong ,  The Riddler  and  DJ Icey .       Political commentators including  Bill Press ,  Michael Reagan ,  Mike Church ,  Bill Bennett ,  Mike Malloy ,  Lynn Samuels  and  G. Gordon Liddy .       Comedians and satirists include  Harry Shearer ,  Duane Cahill ,  Mojo Nixon , and  Jim Breuer .       Entertainment such as Cosmo and Maxim Radio featuring  Covino and Rich .     On November 18, 2004 the former  COO  and President of  Viacom ,  Mel Karmazin , was named the  CEO  of Sirius. Stern worked under Karmazin at Infinity Radio and the two appeared to always have a great deal of mutual respect. It was Karmazin who fiercely protected Stern in the wake of the  Super Bowl XXXVIII Halftime Show  (produced by MTV and aired by CBS, both co-owned with Infinity-now CBS Radio-until  CBS Corporation  split off in 2006) and the FCC crackdown on shock jocks and obscenity, in general.   On October 25, 2005 Sirius announced that ""E Street Radio"", the exclusive channel of legendary artist  Bruce Springsteen , would air from November 1, 2005 to January 31, 2006 on the Bridge - Channel 10. On September 14, 2006, The Bridge was replaced again, by  The Who Channel . This special limited-run channel was moved to channel 98, replacing  Rolling Stones  Radio, and the Bridge restored, on January 1, 2007, But was turned back into E Street Radio again on October 5, 2007.     [ edit ]   Sports   Another cornerstone of Sirius business strategy has been to pursue exclusive sports content. Currently, Sirius has exclusive satellite radio broadcasting rights to all  NFL ,  CFL  and  NBA  games. Sirius also announced in December 2005 a multi-year deal with the NBA, which makes the satellite radio company the broadcaster of more live NBA games than any other radio outlet. Sirius airs  Full Court Press , weekdays from 12 pm - 3 pm ET; FCP is the only all-NBA show on Sirius. The agreement also creates a 24-hour NBA Radio Channel, located on channel 127.  NHL  games were shared with XM for the 20052006 season, and XM now holds exclusive rights. Sirius currently has full  NASCAR  coverage, including, among other programs, a two hour weekly show hosted by NASCAR driver  Tony Stewart .   Sirius also has rights to a number of major college sports teams, including teams in the  Big East ,  Big Ten  and  Southeastern Conferences  as well as  The University of Notre Dame . Beginning in 2005 Sirius also has exclusive radio rights to cover the  NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament . In August 2004, Sirius launched  Sirius NFL Radio , a 24-hour radio stream dedicated exclusively to covering the NFL. Sirius has also been aggressive in creating its own in-house produced studio sports radio content.   Sirius also has the only national  horseracing  talk show,  At the Races , hosted by noted racing handicapper, Steve Byk . The show which airs weekdays between 4 and 7, is unique in the horseracing world.   Sirius also broadcasts select  English Premier League  matches, in addition to airing  World Soccer Daily , a MondayFriday two hour talk show dedicated to  soccer , and has inked an exclusive deal with EPL team  Chelsea . Continuing their major expansion of soccer coverage, Sirius announced a deal to add  UEFA Champions League  soccer to their lineup on September 27, 2006. As of recently Sirius also had exclusive radio rights to broadcast the ESPN television feed of the Euro 2008 championships. In addition, Sirius also has exclusive rights to broadcast  Scottish Premier League  Power  Celtic FC . Rounding out their coverage Sirius also airs a two hour soccer talk show on Wednesday nights on channel 125 called ""The Football Show"" with former Metrostars GM  Charlie Stillitano  and former International Italian star  Giorgio Chinaglia . On Saturdays and Sundays during premier league season, Sirius airs Radio  606 , a classic radio call in show from the UK discussing all of the days top matches.   On September 15th,  Chris Russo  launched his own show on called  Mad Dog Unleashed .     [ edit ]   SIRIUS Music for Business   In August 2003, Sirius partnered with  Clearwater, Florida -based  Applied Media Technologies Corporation , a provider of telephone ""on hold"" messaging. [ 9 ]  AMTC provides Sirius service in a package branded as  Sirius Music for Business . For US$29.95 per month, AMTC provides all of Sirius' streams of commercial-free music, and pays all performance royalties to  ASCAP ,  Broadcast Music Incorporated , and  SESAC , so that business owners may legally play Sirius' music in their establishments.   Unlike the music services  Muzak  /  DMX Music  or  Music Choice , the Sirius business music services use the same channels and  SDARS  delivery platform as the consumer Sirius service. The SDARS delivery platform, on the other hand, is more reliable than any of the other services in that it is not subject to satellite dish  rain fade . Unfortunately, the  highly elliptical orbit  of the Sirius satellite constellation can pose difficulties for the reliable delivery of the signal to stationary antennas in certain parts of the country. To eliminate this potential problem, Sirius intends to launch a  geostationary satellite  to improve service to non-mobile customers such as those of Sirius Business. [ 10 ]  The service can also be accessed online using Sirius' online streaming technology, allowing any business with a broadband Internet connection to overcome any potential reception issues. Additionally, Sirius is applying for repeaters in Hawaii and Alaska.     [ edit ]   Sirius Backseat TV   In March 2007, Sirius announced the upcoming availability of its first video service called ""Backseat TV"". In August 2007, the company revealed details of the first receiver, the SVC1, was originally offered exclusively through Chrysler OEM factory units. The service includes streaming video from three ""family"" television channels:  Nickelodeon ,  Disney Channel  and  Cartoon Network  Mobile. There will be a single screen (or a dual screen option in the  Chrysler Town and Country  and  Dodge Grand Caravan ) for back seat passengers to watch while front seat passengers have the option of simultaneously listening to any normal Sirius radio channel. The service is reported to cost an additional US$6.99 per month on top of the standard Sirius subscription price. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]  The MSRP of the factory installed units is US$470 and the aftermarket unit has an MSRP of US$299.99. Both were made available in the fourth quarter of 2007. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Other content   In June 2005, Sirius signed an agreement with  BBC Radio 1  in the  UK  to rebroadcast the station to an American audience. Sirius also has exclusive satellite radio rights to  National Public Radio , carrying two separate streams (whereas XM's  XM Public Radio  channel carries only programming not produced by NPR, such as by  PRI ). The deal with NPR was the first high-profile deal entered into by Sirius. The Sirius NPR NOW programming does not include the popular programs  All Things Considered  and  Morning Edition .  [ 14 ]   With the launch of Sirius Canada in December 2005, American listeners gained five Canadian-produced stations including  CBC Radio One ,  CBC Radio Three  and  Iceberg Radio , and  Premire Plus  and  Bande  part  for  French  listeners. Iceberg Radio is programmed by  Standard Broadcasting , which also provides a number of additional channels exclusive to Canada; the other four come from the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation . After a delay and outcry from Canadian subscribers, Sirius Canada added Howard Stern's Channel 100 to their lineup in early 2006.  Channel 101 , Stern's other channel (featuring  Bubba the Love Sponge ,  Scott Ferrall , and other personalities), were made available in late June 2006.   Talk radio content recently added onto Sirius Satellite Radio include the ABC News and Talk channel 143, including live feeds of Sean Hannity and Larry Elder's popular syndicated radio shows, Patriot Talk channel 144 (which includes Michael Reagan's well-known syndicated radio show) and Fox News Talk channel 145 (which includes syndicated radio hosts such as Alan Colmes and John Gibson).   On March 14, 2006, Sirius added  Cosmo Radio ,  Playboy Radio , and returned the audio simulcast of the  Fox News Channel  TV feed, which was previously removed during a contract dispute. The service also added Fox's satellite talk radio channel,  Fox News Talk .   In April 2003 Sirius launched  Sirius OutQ , the first ever 24/7 talk channel designed for the  LGBT  audience. Personalities associated with the channel include  Frank DeCaro ,  Michelangelo Signorile ,  Derek Hartley , and  Romaine Patterson .   In addition to the audio programming, the Sirius broadcast stream also carries a  Data Services  channel that is utilized by capable receivers and graphical display hardware. Some of the data services offered are traffic speed and flow, marine weather, and fuel prices to name just a few. Examples of capable hardware are the Raymarine SR100 Satellite Weather receiver and the Alpine NVE-N872A Satellite Traffic Ready navigation system.     [ edit ]   Technology   The Sirius signal is separated into three carriers, one each for the two satellites, and the third for the terrestrial repeater network where available. Sirius receivers decode all three 4 MHz carrier signals at once to achieve  signal diversity . This is in contrast to XM which uses six carriers and decodes three 2 MHz carriers to economize on receiver power consumption and complexity at the cost of channel-changing speed. There is an intentional four-second delay between the two satellite carrier signals. This enables the receiver to maintain a large buffer of the audio stream, which, along with  forward error correction , helps keep the audio playing in the event that the signal is temporarily lost, such as when driving under an overpass or otherwise losing  line-of-sight  of any of the satellites or ground repeater stations.   A third, separate signal is uplinked to the AMC-6  Ku-band  satellite and received by 36-inch  satellite dishes  for the ground repeater network. This third signal is broadcast on a third segment of the signal.     [ edit ]   Receiver technology   At the heart of a Sirius receiver is a custom application specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) chip called the  Baseband Integrated Circuit  currently the STA240, which is produced by  STMicroelectronics . The chip contains embedded  ARM7TDMI  and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from  IP cores . Every baseband has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom  ASIC , the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315 GHz and downconverts them to  intermediate frequency  signals at around 75 MHz. The gain of the signals is approximately -50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16 MB  SDRAM  memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for  Maximal-ratio combining . On newer receivers that let you ""pause"" live radio, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the  head unit , required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.   Sirius offers car radios and home entertainment systems, as well as car and home kits for portable use. The Sirius receiver includes two parts  the antenna module and the receiver module. The antenna module picks up signals from the ground repeaters or the satellite, amplifies the signal and filters out any interference. The signal is then passed on to the receiver module. Inside the receiver module is a chipset consisting of eight chips. The chipset converts the signals from 2.3 gigahertz (GHz) to a lower intermediate frequency. Sirius also offers an adapter that allows conventional car radios to receive satellite signals.   Sirius broadcasts using 12.5 MHz of the  S band  between 2320 and 2332.5 MHz. Audio channels are digitally compressed using a proprietary variant of  Lucent 's  Perceptual audio coder  compression algorithm and encrypted with a proprietary  conditional access  system. Sirius has announced that they intend to implement  hierarchical modulation  technology to economize on bandwidth up to 25%. [ 15 ]   Each receiver must be connected to an external antenna, which is included with the receiver. Antenna placement is crucial to receiving a clear signal. In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For best reception, antennas should be placed such that they have an unobstructed view of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging  eaves  or trees). If this is not an option, the antenna should be placed on an exterior wall. When placing on an exterior wall, the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the center of the continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Satellite technology   Sirius' satellites are named Radiosat because there is already a fleet of satellites named  Sirius , launched by  Sweden 's  NSAB  (Nordiska Satellitaktiebolaget, or Nordic Satellite AB, and known today as  SES Sirius ) and used for general telecommunications and  satellite television  throughout Sweden and the rest of  Scandinavia .   The current, primary uplink facility for Sirius is located in  Vernon ,  Sussex County ,  New Jersey . The original facility was located on the roof of the building housing the Sirius studios in Rockefeller Center in New York City but has since been decommissioned.   Sirius does not as yet use  geostationary satellites , though plans to expand their network in 2008 will add one. Currently, its three satellites fly in  geosynchronous   highly elliptical orbit  ( Tundra orbit ) in a 24-hour orbital period. The elliptical path of its satellite constellation ensures that each satellite spends about 16 hours a day over the continental United States, with at least one satellite over the country at all times. The orbit allows the satellites to broadcast from directly overhead the continental United States, avoiding the problem of large buildings or objects blocking the signal and requiring a much smaller terrestrial repeater network than does sister network XM.     [ edit ]   Current fleet         Sirius spacecraft Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 4 were manufactured by  Space Systems/Loral . The first three of the series were orbited in 2000 by  Proton -K Block-DM3 launch vehicles, with the final three-satellite constellation completed on November 30, 2000. Radiosat 4 is a ground spare, in storage at Space Systems/Lorals facility in  Palo Alto, California , ready to be launched if any of the three active satellites encounter transmission problems. The satellites are based on the Space Systems/Loral 1300 platform.   All three satellites broadcast directly to the consumer's receiver, but due to the highly elliptical orbit only two of them broadcast at any given time.     [ edit ]   Future fleet   On June 8, 2006, Space Systems/Loral announced that it was awarded a contract for the fifth Sirius spacecraft. [ 18 ]  The new spacecraft will feature a nine-meter unfurlable reflector. The first four Sirius spacecraft used more traditional parabolic reflectors. The new satellite has been designed for geostationary orbit, unlike the other satellites in the constellation; the different orbit has the stated purpose of allowing for more consistent reception for fixed location users (many subscribers have reported having to regularly reposition their antennas for optimal reception).   On February 29, 2008, the launch service provider  International Launch Services  (ILS) announced a contract which includes launch of the SIRIUS FM-6 satellite on a  Proton  Breeze M rocket. SIRIUS FM-6 is currently under construction at Space Systems/Loral. ILS anticipates the launch will take place in the fourth quarter of 2010. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Receivers   As of 2005, Sirius receivers are available for various new  Audi ,  BMW ,  Chrysler ,  Dodge ,  Ford ,  Infiniti ,  Jaguar ,  Jeep ,  Land Rover ,  Lexus ,  Lincoln ,  Mazda ,  Mercedes-Benz ,  Mercury ,  MINI ,  Mitsubishi ,  Hyundai , Nissan ,  Scion ,  Toyota  (except  Corolla ),  Porsche ,  Volkswagen , and  Volvo  vehicles, and the service plans on adding availability for portable use.  Subaru  offers Sirius on the Forester and Impreza. Starting in 2006, all  Rolls-Royce  vehicles sold in the United States come with a Sirius radio and lifetime subscription as standard equipment. Sirius has an exclusive contract for VW and Audi vehicles from 2007 through 2012, and with  Kia Motors  from 2008 through 2014, with an optional extension to 2017. Beginning in the 2007 model year,  Bentley  vehicles will have Sirius as an option, and it will be standard equipment in several models beginning in 2008. [ 20 ]   Porsche  switched to  XM Satellite Radio  on their vehicles beginning with the 2007 model year. Currently, only Toyota (including its Lexus and Scion divisions) and Subaru offer both Sirius and XM contracts.   Sirius also makes several receivers for aftermarket installations such as the Sportster4, Starmate Replay, Sirius S50 with built in 1 GB MP3 player, and the Sirius One.   Popular radios from Sirius:     Sportster 5  - plug and play radio with a color screen and one hour of storage   Sirius Stiletto 100  - the first portable Sirius radio that allows subscribers to listen to live Sirius programming. The Stiletto boasts a 2 gigabyte memory, which is roughly equivalent to 100 hours of recording time. The unit's batteries give the user approximately 30 hours of life. The unit also features Wi-Fi technology, which is used as a backup to stream music from the Internet when a clear signal strength is not readily available from the built-in antenna. Sirius' partnerships with Napster and Yahoo Music provide additional content for Stiletto users.   Sirius Stiletto 10  -The ""feature""-lite version to the Stiletto 100. The Stiletto 10 offers all that the Stiletto 100 offers but does not offer Wi-Fi, MP3/WMA playback and only offers 256 megabytes of storage space (about 10 hours of Sirius programming). The Stiletto 10 offers Artist and Song Seek - Not featured on the Stiletto 100 or Stiletto 2. This seek function will watch for your favorite artists and songs that you want to hear and will let you know when they are playing on any other station.   Sirius Stiletto 2  - the newest portable Sirius radio. A slimmer, improved version of the Stilleto 100. Has microSD slot behind battery for storing MP3/WMA files and playlists (not Sirius content). Wi-Fi support expanded to handle WPA and WPA2 (non-Enterprise) with passcodes.   Sportster 3  was the first radio to use the new universal dock station.   Sirius S50  - the first portable Sirius radio - which is not a LIVE portable, it has to be plugged in to a home or car dock where content can be downloaded for later listening   Sirius Starmate ST1  (note: ST1C is the Canadian version)   Sirius Starmate Replay ST2   Sirius Sportster Exec.

Widget       Sirius subscribers are also able to access all of the proprietary music channels and most of the talk stations via  streaming media  through Sirius.com.   Attractive alternatives to the browser based player are available such as a  Yahoo! Widget  (designed to look like a miniature Sportster model), and SIRIUS Internet Radio Player (based on Windows Media Player and available as plug-in or standalone application). Both alternatives are gaining popularity with streaming listeners, and offer artist and track name information updated in real time, which is an improvement from the online Sirius player.   NiceMac LLC, creator of the StarPlayr and StarLightXM product lines have created clients for Mac, PC, Windows Mobile and iPhone. The company recently merged with Jason Millard of Millard Software and plans to release uSirius StarPlayr, a Sirius XM iPhone client in 2009.  [1]   Sirius subscribers who use a  Linux -based operating system can use  Sipie  to stream on-line channels. Neither Windows Media Player nor a web browser are needed.   In addition to being available through Sirius.com, Howard Stern's website offers a  Java  application that streams the two Stern-themed channels. The site also states that Stern-specific video and audio clips will be made available at a later date. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Sirius in Canada       Main article:  Sirius Canada       In November 2004, a partnership between Sirius,  Standard Broadcasting  and the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  filed an application with the  Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission  to introduce Sirius in  Canada . The application was approved on June 16, 2005. The decision was appealed to the  Canadian federal cabinet  by a number of broadcasting, labour, and arts and culture organizations, including the  Friends of Canadian Broadcasting ,  CHUM Limited , and the  National Campus and Community Radio Association . The groups objected to Sirius approach to and reduced levels of  Canadian content  and  French language  programming, along with the exclusion of Canadian non-commercial broadcasting. After a lengthy debate, cabinet rejected the appeals on September 9, 2005.  Sirius Canada  was officially launched December 1, 2005.   The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has reported poor reception in  northern Canada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Sirius Internet Radio   In October 2006, Sirius announced that it was launching a new service named  Sirius Internet Radio  that offers approximately 75 of the 135 Sirius channels worldwide to people other than subscribers to its satellite radio service. Prior to this, Sirius subscribers who had a satellite radio were also able to access many of the Sirius channels via the internet, using a special password, but the service operated at 32 kbit/s  and was only available to those who purchased a satellite radio receiver. Sirius Internet Radio (SIR) is an internet-only subscription, allowing worldwide listeners to listen to the content without having to purchase a satellite radio receiver. The service also expands the number of channels that are available to Stiletto 100 users via  WiFi .     [ edit ]   Possible bankruptcy/merger   As of 11 February 2009, Sirius XM had $3.25 billion in total debt and had until 17 February 2009 to repay $175 million in bonds held by  EchoStar . EchoStar has been buying Sirius XM's debt since an unsuccessful December 2008 takeover bid. Sirius may instead form a deal with  DirecTV . Shares of Sirius XM have been trading for less than 1$ since 10 September 2008. [ 23 ]  The company has announced that it may file for bankruptcy ""as early as"" Tuesday, February 17, 2009.

The first  geosynchronous   communication satellite ,  Syncom 2  was launched in 1963. The world's first commercial communication satellite, called  Intelsat I  (nicknamed Early Bird), was launched into synchronous orbit on  April 6 ,  1965 . The first national  network  of satellite television, called  Orbita , was created in  Soviet Union  in 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical  Molniya  satellite for re-broadcasting and delivering of TV  signal  to ground  downlink  stations. The first domestic North American satellite to carry television was  Canada s geostationary  Anik 1 , which was launched in 1972. [ 1 ]   ATS-6 , the world's first experimental educational and  Direct Broadcast Satellite , was launched in 1974. The first Soviet geostationary satellite to carry  Direct-To-Home  television, called  Ekran , was launched in 1976.     [ edit ]   Technology   Satellites used for television signals are generally in either naturally highly elliptical (with  inclination  of +/-63.4 degrees and orbital period of about 12 hours, also known as  Molniya orbit ) or geostationary orbit 37,000 km (22,300 miles) above the earths  equator .   Satellite television, like other communications relayed by satellite, starts with a transmitting antenna located at an  uplink  facility. Uplink satellite dishes are very large, as much as 9 to 12 meters (30 to 40 feet) in diameter. The increased diameter results in more accurate aiming and increased signal strength at the satellite. The uplink dish is pointed toward a specific satellite and the uplinked signals are transmitted within a specific frequency range, so as to be received by one of the transponders tuned to that frequency range aboard that satellite. The transponder 'retransmits' the signals back to Earth but at a different frequency band (a process known as translation, used to avoid interference with the uplink signal), typically in the  C-band  (48 GHz) or  K u -band  (1218 GHz) or both. The leg of the signal path from the satellite to the receiving Earth station is called the downlink.   A typical satellite has up to 32 transponders for Ku-band and up to 24 for a C-band only satellite, or more for hybrid satellites. Typical transponders each have a bandwidth between 27 MHz and 50 MHz. Each geo-stationary C-band satellite needs to be spaced 2 degrees from the next satellite (to avoid interference). For K u  the spacing can be 1 degree. This means that there is an upper limit of 360/2 = 180 geostationary C-band satellites and 360/1 = 360 geostationary K u -band satellites. C-band transmission is susceptible to terrestrial interference while K u -band transmission is affected by  rain  (as water is an excellent absorber of microwaves at this particular frequency).   The downlinked satellite signal, quite weak after traveling the great distance (see  inverse-square law ), is collected by a  parabolic  receiving dish, which reflects the weak signal to the dishs focal point. Mounted on brackets at the dish's focal point is a device called a  feedhorn . This feedhorn is essentially the flared front-end of a section of  waveguide  that gathers the signals at or near the focal point and 'conducts' them to a probe or pickup connected to a  low-noise block downconverter  or LNB. The LNB amplifies the relatively weak signals, filters the block of frequencies in which the satellite TV signals are transmitted, and converts the block of frequencies to a lower frequency range in the  L-band  range. The evolution of LNBs was one of necessity and invention.   The original C-Band satellite TV systems used a Low Noise Amplifier connected to the feedhorn at the focal point of the dish. The amplified signal was then fed via very expensive 50 Ohm impedance  coaxial cable  to an indoor receiver or in other designs fed to a downconverter (a mixer and a voltage tuned oscillator with some filter circuitry) for downconversion to an intermediate frequency. The channel selection was controlled, typically by a voltage tuned oscillator with the tuning voltage being fed via a separate cable to the headend. But this simple design evolved.   Designs for  microstrip  based converters for Amateur Radio frequencies were adapted for the 4 GHz C-Band. Central to these designs was concept of block downconversion of a range of frequencies to a lower, and technologically more easily handled block of frequencies ( intermediate frequency ).   The advantages of using an LNB are that cheaper cable could be used to connect the indoor receiver with the satellite TV dish and LNB, and that the technology for handling the signal at L-Band and UHF was far cheaper than that for handling the signal at C-Band frequencies. The shift to cheaper technology from the 50 Ohm impedance cable and  N-Connectors  of the early C-Band systems to the cheaper 75 Ohm technology and  F-Connectors  allowed the early satellite TV receivers to use, what were in reality, modified  UHF  TV tuners which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to another lower  intermediate frequency  centered on 70 MHz where it was demodulated. This shift allowed the satellite television  DTH  industry to change from being a largely hobbyist one where receivers were built in low numbers and complete systems were expensive (costing thousands of Dollars) to a far more commercial one of mass production.   Direct broadcast satellite dishes are fitted with an LNBF, which integrates the feedhorn with the LNB.   The satellite receiver demodulates and converts the signals to the desired form (outputs for television, audio, data, etc.). Sometimes, the receiver includes the capability to  unscramble  or  decrypt ; the receiver is then called an  Integrated receiver/decoder  or IRD. The cable connecting the receiver to the LNBF or LNB must be of the low loss type  RG-6 , quad shield RG-6 or RG-11, etc. It cannot be standard  RG-59 .   (A new form of  omnidirectional  satellite antenna, which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle, was recently announced by the  University of Waterloo . [ 2 ]  )     [ edit ]   Standards   Analog television distributed via satellite is usually sent scrambled or unscrambled in  NTSC ,  PAL , or  SECAM  television broadcast standards. The analog signal is  frequency modulated  and is converted from an FM signal to what is referred to as  baseband . This baseband comprises the video signal and the audio subcarrier(s). The audio subcarrier is further demodulated to provide a raw audio signal.   If the signal is a digitized television signal or multiplex of signals, it is typically  QPSK .   In general, digital television, including that transmitted via satellites, are generally based on open standards such as  MPEG  and  DVB-S .   The  conditional access  encryption/scrambling methods include  BISS ,  Conax ,  Digicipher ,  Irdeto ,  Nagravision ,  PowerVu ,  Viaccess ,  Videocipher , and  VideoGuard . Many conditional access systems have been compromised.     [ edit ]   Categories of usage   There are three primary types of satellite television usage: reception direct by the viewer, reception by local television affiliates, or reception by  headends  for distribution across terrestrial  cable systems .   Direct to the viewer reception includes  direct broadcast satellite  or DBS and  television receive-only  or TVRO, both used for homes and businesses including hotels, etc.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast via satellite   Direct broadcast satellite , (DBS) also known as ""Direct-To-Home"" is a relatively recent development in the world of television distribution. Direct broadcast satellite can either refer to the communications satellites themselves that deliver DBS service or the actual television service. DBS systems are commonly referred to as ""mini-dish"" systems. DBS uses the upper portion of the K u  band, as well as portions of the K a  band.   Modified DBS systems can also run on C-band satellites and have been used by some networks in the past to get around legislation by some countries against reception of K u -band transmissions.   Most of the DBS systems use the  DVB-S  standard for transmission. With  Pay-TV  services, the datastream is encrypted and requires proprietary reception equipment. While the underlying reception technology is similar, the  Pay-TV  technology is proprietary, often consisting of a  Conditional Access Module  and  smart card .   This measure assures satellite television providers that only authorised, paying subscribers have access to Pay TV content but at the same time can allow  free-to-air  (FTA) channels to be viewed even by the people with standard equipment (DBS receivers without the Conditional Access Modules) available in the market.     [ edit ]   Television receive-only   The term  Television receive-only , or TVRO, arose during the early days of satellite television reception to differentiate it from commercial satellite television uplink and downlink operations (transmit and receive). This was before there was a  DTH  satellite television broadcast industry. Satellite television channels at that time were intended to be used by cable television networks rather than received by home viewers. Satellite TV receiver systems were largely constructed by hobbyists and engineers. These TVRO system operated mainly on the  C band  frequencies and the dishes required were large; typically over 3 meters (10 ft) in diameter. Consequently TVRO is often referred to as ""big dish"" or ""Big Ugly Dish"" (BUD) satellite television.   TVRO systems are designed to receive analog and digital  satellite  feeds of both television or audio from both C-band and K u -band  transponders  on  FSS -type satellites. The higher frequency K u -band systems tend to be  Direct To Home  systems and can use a smaller dish antenna because of the higher power transmissions and greater antenna gain.   TVRO systems tend to use larger rather than smaller satellite dish antennas, since it is more likely that the owner of a TVRO system would have a C-band-only setup rather than a K u  band-only setup. Additional receiver boxes allow for different types of digital satellite signal reception, such as DVB/MPEG-2 and  4DTV .   The narrow beam width of a normal parabolic satellite antenna means it can only receive signals from a single satellite at a time.  Simulsat  or the Vertex-RSI TORUS, is a quasi-parabolic satellite earthstation antenna that is capable of receiving satellite transmissions from 35 or more C- and K u -band satellites simultaneously.   DIRECT TO HOME TELEVISION (DTH)  Today, most satellite TV customers in developed television markets get their programming through a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) provider, such as DISH TV or DTH platform. The provider selects programs and broadcasts them to subscribers as a set package. Basically, the providers goal is to bring dozens or even hundreds of channels to the customers television in a form that approximates the competition from Cable TV. Unlike earlier programming, the providers broadcast is completely digital, which means it has high picture and stereo sound quality. Early satellite television was broadcast in C-band - radio in the 3.4-gigahertz (GHz) to 7 GHz frequency range. Digital broadcast satellite transmits programming in the Ku frequency range (10 GHz to 14 GHz ). There are five major components involved in a direct to home (DTH) satellite system: the programming source, the broadcast center, the satellite, the satellite dish and the receiver.   Programming sources are simply the channels that provide programming for broadcast. The provider (the DTH platform) doesnt create original programming itself; it pays other companies (HBO, for example, or ESPN or STAR TV or Sahara etc.) for the right to broadcast their content via satellite. In this way, the provider is kind of like a broker between the viewer and the actual programming sources. (Cable television networks also work on the same principle.) The broadcast center is the central hub of the system. At the broadcast center or the Playout & Uplink location, the television provider receives signals from various programming sources, compresses these signals using digital compression (scrambling if necessary), and beams a broadcast signal to the proper satellite. The satellite receive the signal from the broadcast station and rebroadcast them to the ground. The viewers dish picks up the signal from the satellite (or multiple satellites in the same part of the sky) and passes it on to the receiver in the viewers house. The receiver processes the signal and passes it on to a standard television. These are the steps in greater detail:   THE PROGRAMMING   Satellite TV providers get programming from two major sources: International turnaround channels (such as HBO, ESPN and CNN, STAR TV, SET, B4U etc) and various local channels (SaBe TV, Sahara TV, Doordarshan, etc). Most of the turnaround channels also provide programming for cable television, so sometimes some of the DTH platforms will ad in some special channels exclusive to itself to attract more subscriptions. Turnaround channels usually have a distribution center that beams their programming to a geostationary satellite. The broadcast center uses large satellite dishes to pick up these analog and digital signals from several sources.   THE BROADCAST CENTER   The broadcast center converts all of this programming into a high-quality, uncompressed digital stream. At this point, the stream contains a vast quantity of data  about 270 megabits per second (Mbit/s) for each channel. In order to transmit the signal from there, the broadcast center has to compress it. Otherwise, it would be too big for the satellite to handle. The providers use the MPEG-2 compressed video format  the same format used to store movies on DVDs. With MPEG-2 compression, the provider can reduce the 270-Mbit/s stream to about 3 or 10 Mbit/s (depending on the type of programming). This is the crucial step that has made DTH service a success. With digital compression, a typical satellite can transmit about 200 channels. Without digital compression, it can transmit about 30 channels. At the broadcast center, the high-quality digital stream of video goes through an MPEG-2 encoder, which converts the programming to MPEG-2 video of the correct size and format for the satellite receiver in your house.   ENCRYPTION & TRANSMISSION   After the video is compressed, the provider needs to encrypt it in order to keep people from accessing it for free. Encryption scrambles the digital data in such a way that it can only be decrypted (converted back into usable data) if the receiver has the correct decoding satellite receiver with decryption algorithm and security keys. Once the signal is compressed and encrypted, the broadcast center beams it directly to one of its satellites. The satellite picks up the signal, amplifies it and beams it back to Earth, where viewers can pick it up.   THE DISH   A satellite dish is just a special kind of antenna designed to focus on a specific broadcast source. The standard dish consists of a parabolic (bowl-shaped) surface and a central feed horn. To transmit a signal, a controller sends it through the horn, and the dish focuses the signal into a relatively narrow beam. The dish on the receiving end cant transmit information; it can only receive it. The receiving dish works in the exact opposite way of the transmitter. When a beam hits the curved dish, the parabola shape reflects the radio signal inward onto a particular point, just like a concave mirror focuses light onto a particular point. The curved dish focuses incoming radio waves onto the feed horn. In this case, the point is the dishs feed horn, which passes the signal onto the receiving equipment. In an ideal setup, there arent any major obstacles between the satellite and the dish, so the dish receives a clear signal. In some systems, the dish needs to pick up signals from two or more satellites at the same time. The satellites may be close enough together that a regular dish with a single horn can pick up signals from both. This compromises quality somewhat, because the dish isnt aimed directly at one or more of the satellites. A new dish design uses two or more horns to pick up different satellite signals. As the beams from different satellites hit the curved dish, they reflect at different angles so that one beam hits one of the horns and another beam hits a different horn. The central element in the feed horn is the low noise blockdown converter, or LNB. The LNB amplifies the signal bouncing off the dish and filters out the noise (signals not carrying programming). The LNB passes the amplified, filtered signal to the satellite receiver inside the viewers house.   THE RECEIVER   The end component in the entire satellite TV system is the receiver. The receiver has four essential jobs: It de-scrambles the encrypted signal. In order to unlock the signal, the receiver needs the proper decoder chip for that programming package. The provider can communicate with the chip, via the satellite signal, to make necessary adjustments to its decoding programs. The provider may occasionally send signals that disrupt illegal de-scramblers, as an electronic counter measure (ECM) against illegal users. It takes the digital MPEG-2 signal and converts it into an analog format that a standard television can recognize. Since the receiver spits out only one channel at a time, you cant tape one program and watch another. You also cant watch two different programs on two TVs hooked up to the same receiver. In order to do these things, which are standard on conventional cable, you need to buy an additional receiver. Some receivers have a number of other features as well. They pick up a programming schedule signal from the provider and present this information in an onscreen programming guide. Many receivers have parental lock-out options, and some have built-in Digital Video Recorders (DVRs), which let you pause live television or record it on a hard drive. While digital broadcast satellite service is still lacking some of the basic features of conventional cable (the ability to easily split signals between different TVs and VCRs, for example), its high-quality picture, varied programming selection and extended service areas are features now seen as an alternative. With the rise of digital cable, which also has improved picture quality and extended channel selection, the TV war is really heating up. Just about anything could happen in the next 10 years as all of these television providers battle it out.     [ edit ]   Satellite television by region and country             This article or section contains  weasel words , vague phrasing that often accompanies  biased  or  unverifiable  information. Such statements should be  clarified or removed .         [ edit ]   Africa          A heavily decorated satellite dish in  Taormina ,  Sicily       South African -based  Multichoice 's  DStv  is the main digital satellite television provider in sub-Saharan Africa, broadcasting principally in  English , but also in  Portuguese ,  German  and  Afrikaans .  Canal Horizons , owned by  France 's  Canal+ , is the main provider in  French-speaking   Africa . Another entrant into the satellite television circuit in Africa is MyTvAfrica, a subsidiary of Dubai based Strong Technologies. Satellite television has been far more successful in Africa than cable, primarily because the infrastructure for cable television does not exist and would be expensive to install since majority of Africans cannot afford paid cable television. Furthermore, maintaining a cable network is expensive due to the need to cover larger and more sparsely populated areas though there are some terrestrial pay-TV and  MMDS  services.   The launch of Free2view has made satellite TV available to the masses in Africa. Free2view currently broadcasts MSNBC as its exclusive news channel and is about to roll out additional channels.   GTV, a British-based company, has become the second in sub-saharan Africa providing digital satellite television with the focus first on Kenya Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Congo ETC.     [ edit ]   Nigeria   Traditionally  DStv  had held a monopoly over  Nigeria 's Satellite television sector but three new companies,  HiTV  mytv and trend tv are starting to compete in this sector.     [ edit ]   Sudan   Sudan TV , the government-owned national network, is available by satellite as well as broadcast. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   The Americas     [ edit ]   Canada     See also:  Multichannel television in Canada     In Canada, the two legal DBS services available are  Bell TV  and  Star Choice . The  CRTC  has refused to license American satellite services, but nonetheless hundreds of thousands (up to a million by some estimates) of Canadians access or have accessed American services [ 4 ]   usually these services have to be billed to an American address and are paid for in  U.S. dollars , although many viewers receive American signals through  pirate decryption . Whether such activity is  grey market  or  black market  is the source of often heated debate between those who would like greater choice and those who argue that the protection of Canadian firms and Canadian  culture  is more important.   In October 2004,  Quebec  judge Danile Ct ruled Canada's  Radiocommunication Act  to be in direct violation of the  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , insofar as it bans reception of unlicensed foreign television services. The judgment gave the federal government a one-year deadline to remedy this breach of the Constitution. However, this contradicts prior  Supreme Court of Canada  decisions and, at last word in late 2004, was expected to be appealed. [ citation needed ]   In addition, Canadian satellite providers continue to be plagued by the unquestionably black market devices which ""pirate"" or ""steal"" their signals as well as by a number of otherwise completely lawful devices which can be reprogrammed to receive  pirate TV .   One  cable TV  CEO (Karl Pladeau of  Qubecor , which owns  Vidotron ) is on public record as demanding conditions be placed on the CRTC license issued to  Bell TV , due to Bell TVs reputation for vastly inferior security compared to its cable rivals and  Shaw Cable owned Star Choice.   Although there are no official statistics, the use of American satellite services in Canada appears to be declining as of 2004.   Some would claim that this is probably due to a combination of increasingly aggressive police enforcement and an unfavourable  exchange rate  between the  Canadian  and U.S. currencies. As the U.S. dollar has been declining as of 2005 versus other international currencies, the decline in DirecTV viewership in Canada may well be related not to a cost difference as much as to the series of smart card swaps which have rendered the first three generations of DirecTV access cards (F, H and HU) all obsolete.     [ edit ]   Latin America   Latin Americas main satellite system are  SKY Latin America , which has approximately 1.4 million subscribers in each of  Brazil  and  Mexico  and  DirecTV  Latin America, which provides service to the rest of the  Americas , with a total of approximately 1.3 million subscribers. Pay-TV is not popular among Latin Americans because fees are expensive in  PPP  terms.   The service offered in Brazil includes Digital TV with full Dolby Digital surround support, mts and multiple subtitle options, a first for the Brazilian market. A recent update to Sky's services in Brazil is Sky+ which allows the customer to record a program while watching another one, this service is however very expensive resulting in very few clients subscribing to this add-on.     [ edit ]   United States   Currently, there are two primary satellite television providers of subscription based service available to  United States  consumers:  Dish Network  and  DirecTV .   Over the past three decades, various U.S. satellite services have come and gone or combined to form the current primary services. In 1975  RCA  created  Satcom 1 , the first satellite built especially for use by the then three national television networks ( CBS ,  NBC , and  ABC ). Later that same year,  HBO  leased a transponder on Satcom 1 and began transmission of television programs via satellite to cable systems. Owners of cable systems paid $10,000 to install 3-meter dishes to receive TV signal in  C-band . In 1976  Taylor Howard  built an amateur system, which consisted of a converted military surplus radar dish and a satellite receiver designed and built by Howard, for home satellite reception. Taylor's system could be used for receiving TV programs both from American and Soviet  communication satellites . In 1977  Pat Robertson  launched the first satellite-delivered basic cable service called the  CBN Cable Network . In 1979, the Satellite Home Viewers Act allowed homeowners in the US to own and operate their own home satellite system, consisting of C-band equipment from a multitude of manufacturers who were making parts for systems such as Taylor Howard's, and began a large controversy of which channels could be received by whom.   USSB  was a direct-to-home service founded in 1981. In the early 1990s they partnered with  Hughes  and continued operation until purchased in 1998 by DirecTV.   In 1991  Primestar  launched as the first North American DBS service. Hughess DirecTV, the first national high-powered upper K u -band DBS system, went online in 1994. The DirecTV system became the new delivery vehicle for USSB. News Corporation currently holds a 38% stake, which it is in the process of selling to Liberty Media. In 1996,  EchoStar s Dish Network went online in the United States and has gone on to similar success as DirecTVs primary competitor. The  AlphaStar  service launched in 1996 and went into bankruptcy in 1997. Dominion Video Satellite Inc's  Sky Angel  also went online in the United States in 1996 with its DBS service geared towards ""faith and family"". Primestar sold its assets to Hughes in 1999 and switched from DBS to an IPTV platform.   In 2004,  Cablevision s  Voom  service went online, specifically catering to the emerging market of  HDTV  owners and aficionados, but folded in April 2005. The services exclusive high-definition channels were migrated to the  Dish Network  system. Commercial DBS services are the primary competition to cable television service, although the two types of service have significantly different regulatory requirements (for example, cable television has  public access  requirements, and the two types of distribution have different regulations regarding carriage of local stations).          90cm multiple-LNA toroidal satellite dish       The majority of  ethnic-language  broadcasts in North America are carried on K u  band free-to-air. The largest concentration of ethnic programming is on  Galaxy 25  at 97 W.  Pittsburgh International Telecommunications  and  GlobeCast World TV  offers a mix of free and pay-TV ethnic channels in the internationally-standard DVB-S format, as do others.  Home2US Communications Inc.  also offers several ethnic channels on AMC-4 at 101 W, as well as other free and pay-TV channels. Several U.S.-English language network affiliates (representing CBS, NBC, ABC,  PBS ,  FOX ,  the CW  (formerly  the WB  and  UPN ),  ION Network  and  MyNetworkTV ) are available as free-to-air broadcasts, as are the three U.S.-Spanish language networks ( Univisin ,  Telefutura  and  Telemundo ). The number of free-to-air specialty channels is otherwise rather limited. Specific FTA offerings tend to appear and disappear rather often and typically with little or no notice, although sites such as LyngSat do track the changing availability of both free and pay channels worldwide. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Asia     [ edit ]   Bangladesh   Currently there are no direct to home satellite broadcasters in Bangladesh, however there are more then 20 local tv channels which are being offered via satellite.     [ edit ]   India   Over 300 TV Satellite television channels are broadcast in India. This includes channels from the state-owned  Doordarshan ,  News Corporation  owned  STAR TV ,  Sony  owned  Sony Entertainment Television ,  Sun Network  and  Zee TV . Direct To Home service is provided by  Airtel Digital Tv ,  BIG TV ,  DD Direct Plus ,  DishTV  and  Tata Sky .          Tata Sky Dish India       These services are provided by locally built satellites from  ISRO  such as  [ 6 ]  INSAT 4CR, INSAT 4A, INSAT-2E, INSAT-3C and INSAT-3E as well as private satellites such as the Dutch-based SES, Global-owned  NSS 6 , Thaicom-2 and Telstar 10.     [ edit ]   Kazakhstan   The first satellite TV channel in  Kazakstan ,  CaspioNet , was launched by the  Khabar  news agency in 2002.     [ edit ]   Malaysia          Astro's ""mini-dish"".       Malaysia's sole satellite television operator, Measat Broadcast Network Systems (a subsidiary of  Astro All Asia Networks plc ) launched  Astro  in 1996. It currently holds exclusive rights from the Malaysian government to offer satellite television broadcasting services in the country through the year 2017. The rights was extended to 2022 recently.     [ edit ]   Japan   The medium-scale Broadcasting Satellite for Experimental Purposes (BSE) was planned by Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MOPT) and developed by the National Space Development Agency of Japan ( NASDA ) since 1974. After that, the first Japanese experimental broadcasting satellite, called BSE or  Yuri , was launched in 1978.  NHK  started experimental broadcasting of TV program using BS-2a satellite on May, 1984.   The satellite BS-2a was launched in preparation for the start of full scale 2-channel broadcasts.  Broadcasting Satellite  BS-2a was the first national  DBS  (direct broadcasting satellite), transmitting signals directly into the home of TV viewers. Attitude control of the satellite was conducted using the 3 axial method (zero momentum), and design life was 5 years. The TV transponder units are designed to sufficiently amplify transmitted signals to enable reception by small, 40 or 60 cm home-use parabolic  antennas . The satellite was equipped with 3 TV transponders (including reserve units). However, one transponder malfunctioned 2 months after launch (March 23, 1984) and a second transponder malfunctioned 3 months after launch (May 3, 1984). So, the scheduled satellite broadcasting had to be hastily adjusted to test broadcasting on a single channel.   Later, NHK started regular service ( NTSC ) and experimental  HDTV  broadcasting using BS-2b on June, 1989. Some Japanese producers of home electronic consumer devices began to deliver  TVsets ,  VCRs  and even home acoustic systems equipped by built-in satellite  tuners  or  receivers . Such electronic goods had a specific  BS  logo.   On April, 1991, Japanese company  JSB  started pay TV service while BS-3 communication satellite was in use. In 1996 total number of households that receive satellite broadcasting exceeded 10 million.   The modern two satellite systems in use in Japan are BSAT and JCSAT; the modern  WOWOW   Broadcasting Satellite  digital service uses BSAT satellites, while other system of digital TV broadcasting  SKY PerfecTV!  uses JCSAT satellites.     [ edit ]   Pakistan   In the recent years, there has been a lot of investment in television industry in Pakistan. There are more than 90 Satellite channels operating directly inside Pakistan and about 40 operating their broadcasting from  Dubai ,  Thailand ,  Bangkok  and  UK .

[ edit ]   Thailand     See also:  TrueVisions   and  Media in Thailand     TrueVisions  is the leading pay TV service of Thailand which operate cable TV in  Bangkok  and satellite TV across the country. TrueVisions is owned by True Corporation. VIet Nam sat is just launched in 4/2008     [ edit ]   Australasia     [ edit ]   Australia   Satellite television in  Australia  has proven to be a far more feasible option than cable television, perhaps due to the vast distances between population centres, (although Canada, which also has large distances between population centres, has a relatively high cable television penetration rate). The first service to come online in Australia was  Galaxy , which was later taken over by Cable Television giant  Foxtel , which now operates both cable and satellite services to all state capital cities (except Darwin and Hobart) and the whole of Western Australia. Its main metropolitan rival was  Optus Vision , while rural areas are served by  Austar , both of which just rebroadcast Foxtel as of 2005. In 2006  SelecTV  began operating, aiming at providing comparatively low cost packages and catering to specialised market segments.     [ edit ]   New Zealand   In  New Zealand ,  SKY Network Television  offers multichannel digital satellite TV, in addition to its non-digital terrestrial  UHF  service. The newly released  Freeview  service is also available on the Optus D1 satellite, as well as a High Definition digital terrestrial service. The current FTA service broadcasts all of New Zealand's national free-to-air services with the exception of the Prime channel which is owned by SKY TV.     [ edit ]   Europe     [ edit ]   Continental Western Europe   In Europe, DBS satellite services are found mainly on  Astra  satellites at  19.2 east ,  23.5 east , and  28.2 east , and from  Hotbird  (operated by Eutelsat) at 13 east.  BSkyB  (known as Sky) serves the  UK .  SKY Italia ,  Canal Digitaal  and  UPC  being the main providers in  Italy , the  Netherlands  and  Central Europe .   The overall market share of DBS satellite services in 2004 was 21.4% of all TV homes, however this highly varies from country to country. For example, in Germany, with many  free-to-air  TV-stations, DBS market share is almost 40%, and in Belgium and the Netherlands, its only about 7%, due to the widespread cable networks with exclusive content.     [ edit ]   Russian Federation   The first Soviet communication satellite, called Molniya, was launched in 1965. By November, 1967 the national system of satellite television, called Orbita was deployed. The system consisted of 3 highly  elliptical  Molniya satellites, Moscow-based ground uplink facilities and about 20 downlink stations, located in cities and towns of remote regions of  Siberia  and Far East. Each station had a 12-meter receiving  parabolic antenna  and transmitters for re-broadcasting TV signal to local householders.   However, a large part of Soviet central regions were still not covered by  transponders  of Molniya satellites. By 1976 Soviet engineers developed a relatively simple and inexpensive system of satellite television (especially for Central and Northern Siberia). It included  geostationary satellites  called Ekran equipped with powerful 300 W  UHF  transponders, a broadcasting uplink station and various simple receiving stations located in various towns and villages of Siberian region. The typical receiving station, also called  Ekran , represented itself as a home-use  analog   satellite   receiver  equipped with simple  Yagi-Uda  antenna. Later, Ekran satellites were replaced by more advanced Ekran-M series satellites.   In 1979 Soviet engineers developed  Moskva  (or Moscow) system of broadcasting and delivering of TV signal via satellites. New type of geostationary communication satellites, called  Gorizont , were launched. They were equipped by powerful onboard transponders, so the size of receiving parabolic antennas of downlink stations was reduced to 4 and 2.5 meters (in comparison of early 12- meter dishes of standard orbital downlink stations).   By 1989 an improved version of  Moskva  system of satellite television has been called  Moskva Global'naya  (or Moscow Global). The system included a few  geostationary  Gorizont and Express type of communication satellites. TV signal from Moscow Globals satellites could be received in any country of planet except Canada and North-West of the USA.   Modern Russian satellite broadcasting services based on powerful geostationary buses such as  Gals (satellite) , Express,  Yamal  and  Eutelsat  which provide a large quantity of free-to-air television channels to millions of householders.  Pay-TV  is growing in popularity amongst Russian TV viewers. The  NTV Russia  news company, owned by  Gazprom , broadcasts the  NTV Plus  package to 560,000 households, reaching over 1.5 million viewers. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   United Kingdom and Ireland           Sky Digital  ""mini-dish""       The first commercial DBS service in the  United Kingdom ,  Sky Television , was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched  Astra  satellite at  19.2 east , providing 4 analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent  VideoCrypt  video encryption system used the existing  PAL  broadcast standard. This gave Sky a distinct advantage over the winner of the UK state DBS licence,  BSB .   In the following year, after many delays,  BSB  was launched, broadcasting five channels ( Now ,  Galaxy ,  The Movie Channel ,  The Power Station  and  The Sports Channel ) in  D-MAC  format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was based heavily on the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. While the BSB system was technologically more advanced than the PAL system and one of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the Squarial, an expensive flat plate antenna and LNB. Sky's system used conventional and cheap dish and LNB technology.   The competition between the two companies was fierce and bidding wars over the UK rights to movies. Sky kept costs to a bare minimum, operating from an industrial park in  Isleworth  in West London. BSB had expensive offices in London ( Marco Polo House ). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) though the new BSkyB was really Sky. The technologically more advanced BSB D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky's  VideoCrypt  video encryption system.   In 1994 17% of the group was floated on the  London Stock Exchange  (with  ADRs  listed on the  New York Stock Exchange ), and  Rupert Murdoch s News Corporation owns a 35% stake.   By 1998, following the launch of several more satellites to Astra's  19.2 east  position, the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from Astra's new the at  28.2 east  position under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyBs analogue service has now been discontinued, with all customers having been migrated to Sky Digital.   In May 2008, a free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name  Freesat , carrying a variety of channels from  Astra 28.2E , including some content in HD formats.     [ edit ]   Nordic countries   The first satellite service specifically set to the Nordic region was  TV3  which launched in 1987. With the launch of  Astra 1A , getting the TV3 channel got easier. The first Nordic-specific satellite,  Tele-X , was launched in 1989. The services directed at Scandinavia were then scattered among several satellites. In 1993, the former BSB satellites were bought by a Swedish and a Norwegian company, respectively. These two satellites were renamed  Thor 1  and  Sirius 1 , moved to new positions and started broadcasting services intended for people in the Nordic region. With the launch of additional Thor and Sirius satellites later in the 1990s, Astra and other satellites were abandoned by the Nordic services with almost all Nordic satellite television migrating to the Sirius and Thor satellites.   Initially the basic channels were free-to-air. This caused several rights problems since viewers throughout Europe were able to see very much acquired English language programming as well as sports for free on the Nordic channels, although the channels only held broadcasting rights for specific countries. One way of avoiding that was to switch from PAL to the  D2-MAC  standard, hardly used anywhere outside the Nordic region. An unencrypted channel could still be seen in all the Nordic satellite homes, so eventually all channels went encrypted (several of them only being available in one country).   There are two competing satellite services:  Canal Digital  (Norwegian  Telenor ) and  Viasat  ( Kinnevik ). Canal Digital launched in 1997 and was digital from the start, broadcasting from Thor. Kinnevik had been operating an analogue subscription service since the late 1980s, but waited until the year 2000 before launching a digital service. All analogue services from Thor and Sirius will have ceased in 2006, when the three remaining Danish channels go digital-only. The competition between Viasat and Canal Digital has caused some homes in Scandinavia to have to buy two set-top boxes and have two subscriptions to get the full range of channels. Viasat doesn't provide their own channels (TV3, TV3+, ZTV, TV1000 and the Viasat-branded channels) on the Canal Digital platform. Canal Digital does however have exclusive distribution of channels from  SBS Broadcasting ,  Discovery ,  TV2 Denmark  and  Eurosport ; for several years the Swedish  SVT  and  TV4  channels were also exclusive to Canal Digital.     [ edit ]   Middle East & North Africa   The  Middle East  has a high penetration of homes receiving TV channels via DTH satellite. One of the pioneers of free-to-air digital satellite television is considered to be  MBC , which began broadcasting in  c band  through Arabsat and is the first network in the world to offer a free-to-air Western based English language movie channel to the Middle East audience via its spinoff channel  MBC 2 . Its direct rival is considered to be  Dubai , UAE based  One TV , earlier called Channel 33, which was the first channel in the Middle East to provide English language general entertainment programming for the expatriate community.   Nourmina Channel is the first satellite channel owned by a Jordanian national of the private sector, which broadcasts on Nile Sat reluctantly 12303H, which covers all the Arab countries, Africa and most parts of Europe The first digital DTH pay-TV network to provide Indian Entertainment was  Orbit Satellite Television and Radio Network  broadcasting via  Eurobird 2  (Ku band), later on  Showtime Arabia  a joint venture between  Viacom  (21% stake) and  KIPCO  (79% stake) started broadcasting, via  PanAmSat  (C band), but later switched over to  Nilesat  ( KU band ).  Arab Radio and Television Network (ART) now known as  Arab Digital Distribution  although a late comer, gained ground by broadcasting exclusive sports events. Most of the popular channels are transmitting from these satellites and orbital positions: Arabsat at 26E,  AsiaSat  at 100.5E and 105.5E,  Eutelsat   Hot Bird  at 13E, Nilesat at 7W, and PanAmSat at 68.5E.   In Israel, Satellite TV services were introduced by YES! company, using Israeli based  Amos (satellite) .

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .

By The Guru  | January 12, 2009               It seems like ER has been on forever, since my late childhood in fact.  That was a LONG time ago. When I woke up this morning and  read that NBC had postponed it’s death  for 3 more episodes I could hardly believe my eyes.  This is a show that just won’t seem to die.  Does anyone still watch the show?    Don’t get me wrong, ER WAS a great show.  It was created by my favorite author (Michael Crichton) and helped give birth to George Clooney’s superstar success.  However there are definitely a few shows on TV that are past their prime, and ER is one of them.    I really think its time for NBC to let this show go, we want to see something new, fresh and exciting. In my eyes ER has been on life support for years now and its time for NBC to finally just pull the plug.

I just want to point out that episodes 3 and 4 will also premiere together Monday (tomorrow).    In 24 Season 7 Episode 2 (which takes place between 9 and 10am) we start to see the danger posed by Tony when he demonstrates exactly what the CIP device can do by using it on an air traffic control tower.  The writers also start to tie this season into the prequel (24 Redemption) when President Taylor meets with Prime Minister Motombo of Sangala.    After watching both episodes back to back tonight, I’m going to be on the edge of my seat until tomorrow - I hope I can sleep tonight.  I’m so glad that 24 is back, and better than ever.  What are your thoughts on the first 2 episodes?

We can all thank the Writers Guild of America Strike for causing the delay.  If you didn’t catch the 24 prequel called “24 Redemption” that lead up to season 7 basically Jack somehow ended up as washup in Africa.  However he  just can’t seem to get a break because he ends up in the middle of a big military coup.  Redemption was created to bridge the gap between season 6 and 7 and takes place about 3 years after season 6.   In 24 Season 7 Episode 1, CTU has been disbanded and Jack is back in the US and faces persecution for actions he took while chasing bad guys in the past. We also start to learn about a terrorist plot intended to cripple the nations computer infrastructure. Episodes 1 and 2 will premiere on the same night (Sunday January 11th), and then the third and 4th episodes of the season will premiere on Monday January 12th.   Although 24 Season 7 has a lot to live up to, there is no doubt in my mind that this is going to be one of the best seasons of 24 yet.  I think  the best is yet to come with 24 and the never ending action shows no signs of slowing down.   Find out how to  Watch 24 Season 7 Episodes Online .

Chris Matthews Not Running For Senate    By Frank  | January 8, 2009             The rumor mill has been churning out all sorts of speculations in the news TV sector. The most recent of which was the MSNC host Chris Matthews may consider running for a Senate spot. As you may have already guessed, he isn’t. Now, I’ll admit that the idea isn’t all that far fetched. After all, if you spend all of your time talking about politics and what’s going on in the political spectrum, and it’s likely that you’d consider stepping into the political arena yourself. Heck if people like Jessie the Body and Arnold can get elected to important government positions, I gotta believe anyone with enough bank has a shot at it.   Now, you may have believe that news is boring, and you might be right, but having various news shows on all day while I work (all..day…), I can’t help but be interested in seeing what’s in store for these guys, even if it’s a show that I’m not such a fan of, like Hardball.   Matthews had apparently been experimenting with the idea for some time, and he may have taken on Republican Sen. Arlen Specter for the privilege. He was also talking to Democratic higher ups about the prospect of challenging Specter, who has been a five-term senator so far. Who knows, maybe he would’ve won too,but now we may never know!                Topics:   General  |    No Comments »                         30 Rock Brings New Star Power    By Frank  | January 8, 2009             I’ll be honest, I’ve always been fascinated by the show 30 Rock. On one hand, it’s absolutely hilarious and has shown it can keep a good thing rolling without being a one trick pony. It helps that I’m also a fan of the best comedian of the year, Tina Fey (although I’m sure her impersonation of Sarah Palin had as much to do with that title as 30 rock). Despite all of the good things going for it however, it’s still a show that seems to fit a very small niche.Week after week, the ratings come in as good but not so good you could call it a runaway hit.   Of course that doesn’t stop the show creators from bringing in some attractive and talented guest stars. Jennifer Aniston (wow on that magazine cover by the way..just wow) arrived on the show for a guest role to much fanfare, and the show creators will be bringing in another beauty on as well, Salma Hayek.   Salma’s role, as you might have guessed, will span across a number of episodes, and she’ll be playing Colleen Donaghy’s nurse. In addition, much like Jennifer Aniston, she’ll be playing Alec Baldwin’s love interest. With guest stars like these, the show’s able to keep the story fresh, although I’m curious to see if she can do better than Jennifer Cox on Scrubs, cause she was perfect in that role.

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.     [ edit ]   Satellite radio       Main article:  Satellite radio       Satellite radio offers audio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.     [ edit ]   Amateur radio   Amateur radio  operators have access to the  OSCAR  satellites that have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne  repeaters , and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with  UHF  or  VHF  radio equipment and highly directional  antennas  such as  Yagis  or dish antennas. Due to the limitations of ground-based amateur equipment, most amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the  AX.25  or similar protocols.     [ edit ]   Satellite Internet       Main article:  Satellite Internet access       After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the  Internet  via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in very remote areas, and cannot access a  broadband  connection.     [ edit ]   Military uses   Communications satellites are used for  military communications  applications, such as  Global Command and Control Systems . Examples of military systems that use use communication satellites are the  MILSTAR , the  DSCS , and the  FLTSATCOM  of the  United States ,  NATO  satellites,  United Kingdom  satellites, and satellites of the former  Soviet Union . Many military satellites operate in the  X-band , and some also use  UHF  radio links, while MILSTAR also utilizes  Ka band .
