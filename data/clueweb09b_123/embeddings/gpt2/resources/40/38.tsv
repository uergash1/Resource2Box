In severe cases, breathing may be impaired.   Signs and symptoms may include:     Sudden and severe  sore throat   Inflamed  tonsils   Yellow and white patches in the throat   Difficulty swallowing   Tender  cervical   lymphadenopathy   Fever   Headache  (often prior to other symptoms)   General discomfort, feeling ill or uneasy   Halitosis   Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting   Rash [ 2 ]   Hives   Chills   Loss of appetite   Ear pain   Peeling of skin on hands and feet     Additional symptoms such as  sinusitis ,  vaginitis  or  impetigo  be present if the strep bacteria infects both the throat and a secondary location. For additional information on non-pharynx symptoms, see  Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Infection .     [ edit ]   Diagnosis   There are several causes for  pharyngitis , not just streptococcus bacteria. Productive coughing, nasal discharge, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat, though a co-infection with a virus is possible and may explain the presence of these additional symptoms. A  Rapid Strep Test  or a throat culture may be undertaken to help clarify diagnosis.   The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in  infectious mononucleosis  (glandular fever). [ 3 ]   A study of 729 patients with pharyngitis, in which 17% had a positive throat culture for group A streptococcus, identified the following four best predictors of streptococcus, also called the  Centor criteria : [ 4 ]     Lack of cough   Swollen and tender anterior  cervical lymph nodes   (Marked) tonsillar  exudates [ 5 ]   Fever             Number of symptoms   Probability of Strep       0   2.5%       1   6.0 - 6.9%       2   14.1  16.6%       3   30.1  34.1%       4   55.7%           Another study on 621 patients, assigned one point for each of the following symptoms: [ 6 ]     Temperature greater than 38 C   Absence of cough   Tender anterior cervical adenopathy   Tonsillar swelling or exudate   Age younger than 15   Subtracting a point for age older than 45.             Points   Probability of Strep   Management       1 or less   0%   Negative: No antibiotic       2   17%   Indeterminate: antibiotic based on throat culture       3   35%       4 or 5   51%   Positive: for throat culture and antibiotics            Finally, patients usually experience swelling of the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck, but swelling can also be located in the soft palate in the top of the mouth. The absence of tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar or pharyngeal exudates has been suggested as being the most useful finding in ruling out strep throat, with a negative likelihood of 0.74. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Transmission   Strep throat is caused by  Group A streptococcal infection  (GAS), [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  specifically the bacterium  Streptococcus pyogenes . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  It is spread by direct, close contact with an infected person via air-based germs. [ 16 ]  In addition, it may be spread through contamination of pillow cases, toys, toothbrushes and other often-used materials. [ 10 ]  Rarely, contaminated food, especially milk and milk products, can result in outbreaks. [ 17 ]   The  incubation period  for strep throat is thought to be between two to five days, but has been reported as long as eight days. [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment     [ edit ]   Symptomatic therapies   Nonprescription  over the counter drugs  of  ibuprofen  and  paracetamol  (acetaminophen) both help relieve throat pain and reduce fever by an average of 2.2F or 2.3F in children. [ 19 ]  Aspirin is not recommended for children due to the risk of  Reye's syndrome . In adults aspirin, paracetamol, or ibuprofen help reduce back pain by 48% and sore throat by 31%. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Antibiotics   Antibiotics will reduce symptoms slightly, as was the case in one study of 11 adult patients with sore throat and confirmed GAS infection. They were evaluated daily after the start of antibiotic treatment to register symptoms and signs and to measure body temperature. The mean reduction rate was great, but the greatest reduction was after 3 days. Out of all symptoms, reduction scores for muscle or joint pain was the most at 86%, and the lowest for sore throat at 67%. [ 21 ]  Treatment, which consists of penicillin (orally for 10 days or a single intramuscular injection of penicillin G), will also minimize transmission. This is why  GAS  positive children should not go back to school or day care until they have taken antibiotics for at least 48 hours. In one study the potential risk of transmission to close school contact was assessed by taking 47 children with positive throat cultures and randomly selecting them to receive penicillin V, penicillin G, or erythromycin. Throat cultures were then taken the morning after start of antibiotics and 17 (36.2%) had positive throat cultures. Cultures were taken again 24 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy, and only 12 (17%) of the patients still had positive throat cultures. [ 22 ]   Cephalosporins  (such as cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone) are recommended for penicillin-allergic patients. In another study, 41 patients with confirmed penicillin allergy were evaluated with cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxoneall cephalosporinsto see the allergic reaction. Skin tests with cephalosporins were clearly negative in 39 patients and all 41 patients tolerated the three cephalosporins administered. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]  Second-line antibiotics included amoxicillin, [ 25 ]  clindamycin, [ 26 ]  and oral cephalosporins which have a significantly better cure rate than penicillin. [ 27 ]   Studies have also shown that the broader-spectrum of antibiotics offer more effective short treatment courses than the traditional 10 days of Penicillin V, [ 28 ]  but noted that ""widespread use of broad-spectrum agents for a common infection is a significant concern in an age of increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance"". [ 29 ]  It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent rheumatic fever or an abscess on the tonsils. In one report of 500 patients, 30% had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, 0.2% had rheumatic fever and 0.2% had peritonsillar abscess (an abscess on the tonsils). [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Complications   The symptoms of strep throat usually improve even without treatment in five days, but the patient is contagious for several weeks. Lack of treatment or incomplete treatment of strep throat can lead to various complications. Some of them may pose serious health risks. Therefore, streptococcal tonsillitis is important to recognize and treat early. The patient is considered to be contagious up to three days after being treated with antibiotics. [ 30 ]   List of Complications arising from disseminated Streptococcal infection (originating in the throat) [ 31 ]     Scarlet Fever  : a red, raised skin rash caused by  toxins  released by the bacteria   Acute Rheumatic Fever  :  sore joints ,  heart disease ,  involuntary movements  and skin manifestations may occur   Streptococcal Toxic shock syndrome  : septic shock and multi-organ failure   Glomerulonephritis  : a form of  kidney failure  in which antibodies directed against the Streptococcus bacteria become lodged in the kidney, causing damage to the kidney itself   PANDAS Syndrome  : a neurological disorder which can result in permanent injury. Symptoms include  Obsessive-Compulsive  Type disorders and  involuntary movements   Herpes  may be aggravated post-infection     A skin disease known as  necrotizing fasciitis  may occur if Streptococcus bacteria infect a wound on the body, but this is not a complication of strep throat per se.

RSS   Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & History of Abuse - What Do You Think?   Wednesday January 7, 2009          When I saw the first headline about a  new study  linking childhood abuse with  chronic fatigue syndrome  (CFS or  ME/CFS ), I knew it was going to open a big ol' can of worms - especially when I saw who was involved in the research and giving a lot of quotes to the media.  I'll explain why shortly.   First, let's talk about the study itself.  The researchers say they found that 60% of the study participants with ME/CFS had been badly abused as children.  They also say that the people with both ME/CFS and a history of abuse had lower salivary  cortisol  (stress hormone) levels than other people with ME/CFS.  (Earlier studies have shown low cortisol is common with this condition.)  They conclude that childhood abuse impairs the body's stress response, and thereby predisposes the abused to developing ME/CFS later in life.   Here's where the can of worms comes in.  The ME/CFS community has fought for decades to shed the idea that their illness is psychological, in whole or in part.  They've been labeled as ""depressed,"" been referred to mental health counseling instead of getting medical treatment, been told they're psychologically ""weak"" because they can't deal with stress, etc.  Many will view this study as a major setback - especially because it's generating headlines like crazy.   As for the researcher who's being widely quoted, he is Dr. William C. Reeves, of the CDC.  He's at the very center of swirling controversy in the ME/CFS community, and it wouldn't surprise me to see his face on the dart boards of a lot of patients, advocates and researchers.  Many leading members of the community say he uses a different definition of the condition, and thereby skews the results to fit a more psychological model.   While previous studies involving Reeves have shown a high abuse correllation with ME/CFS, other studies have contradicted them, including  one study  that even showed a  lower  incidence of abuse.   What's your opinion on this?  Do you think this study is valid?  Partially valid?  Complete hogwash?  Will the coverage of this give people the wrong idea about ME/CFS?  Do you feel that abuse contributed to your illness?  Do you want a photo of Dr. Reeves for your dart board?

Tuesday January 6, 2009   New Drugs of 2009 Series: Ampligen      While millions of people with  chronic fatigue syndrome  (CFS or  ME/CFS ) have waited decades for better treatments, a drug called Ampligen (poly I: poly C12U) has languished in the ""experimental"" stage for 30 years.     Then, in October 2007, Ampligen's manufacturer, Hemispherex Biopharma Inc., put in a  New Drug Application  for Ampligen as the first ever FDA approved treatment for ME/CFS.  In July, the company responded to questions sent back by the FDA, and the application was officially accepted.  Now, it's just a matter of time before we hear yea or nay.  The decision should be out sometime this year.   Ampligen is an immume-system modulator that works by jump-starting your body's natural anti-viral pathway and regulating levels of  Rnase L  (a substance in your cells that attacks viruses), which can be high in people with ME/CFS. Studies show it's more effective and has far fewer side effects than other drugs in its class. Ampligen has also been studied as a possible treatment for certain types of cancer,  AIDS , and  avian flu .     This drug has been available to certain U.S. clinics for several years, and there's a lot of evidence (both clinical and experiential) showing that it works.  Some doctors claim they've seen improvement in 80% of people with ME/CFS who take Ampligen, and significant improvement in about 50%.  A lot of seriously disabled people have even been able to go back to work because of it, they say.  Side effects are reportedly mild, and oddly enough include flu-like symptoms, dizziness and confusion.  (After living with ME/CFS, would you even recognize those as side effects?)  Here's more info from the manufacturer:  Ampligen, from Hemispherex Biopharma    Personally, I think if Ampligen is approved it will be huge for ME/CFS in a couple of ways.  Of course, we desperately need better medications.  But it would also likely mean more public service announcements and lots of publicity, which could lead to better public education and understanding - which we need  almost  as much as we need treatments.   What do you think Ampligen's approval would mean?  Do you want to try it?  I'd love to hear personal experiences from people who've taken it!

However, the deadline for approving or denying  milnacipran  as a  fibromyalgia treatment  came and went in October 2008.  At that time, the FDA said it needed more time to review data but did not give a timeline.  Since then, there's been no word.  Regardless, we should hear early this year about whether milnacipran has passed muster.   Milnacipran is fairly similar to  Cymbalta  (duloxetine), which was the second drug to be FDA approved for fibromyalgia.  Cymbalta is an SNRI (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), which boosts available levels of  serotonin  and  norepinephrine  in the brain.  To date, all FDA-approved drugs in this class raise serotonin more than norepinephrine, but milnacipran favors norepinephrine.   If approved, milnacipran would be making its debut on the U.S. market.  As an antidepressant, it's been used prescribed for more than a decade in 50 different countries.  It's got a good track record for being well tolerated.  When I've written about it here before, I've gotten comments from people involved in the U.S. clinical trials who say they can't wait to get back on this drug.   Are you waiting for word on milnacipran?  Have you talked to your doctor about it?  Have you taken it?

Why?  Two major reasons.  First, you should be familiar with side effects.  My memory is impaired enough that glancing over them once or twice isn't enough - I need a list I can refer back to.  Second, you need to watch out for drug interactions.  Your pharmacist is the best source of information on what doesn't play nicely with what, but you probably can't call at 2 a.m. when you need something to relieve cold symptoms so you can sleep.   There are a few sites you should bookmark so you can check this information quickly whenever you need to:      Drugs A-Z at About.com    Drugs.com    Medline Plus: Drugs & Supplements    RateADrug.com       All of them have information on FDA approved drugs and many supplements.  You'll find side effects lists, possible interactions, pill identifiers (for those loose pills you find in the back of the medicine cabinet) and much more.  I rely on these resources every time I introduce something new, whether it's a prescription drug, over-the-counter medication, or supplement.  They've stopped me from making a few mistakes that I could've really regretted.   If you have a negative side effect to a drug, you can report it to the FDA for tracking at  MedWatch .

Diagnosing Fibromyalgia    Before doctors can diagnose  fibromyalgia , they need to rule out a host of other conditions.  Typically, they'll order blood tests to rule out other medical disorders with similar symptoms, including  hypothyroidism,  infections,  polymyalgia rheumatica,   rheumatoid arthritis  or  lupus.      Doctors may also order other lab and imaging tests.  Until recently, no test could definitively diagnose fibromyalgia, but a new  blood test  is is now showing promise in some preliminary studies.  It involves antipolymer antibodies, which may be found in about half of the people with FMS.   Fibromyalgia is typically diagnosed and treated by  rheumatologists .  The  American College of Rheumatology  in 1992 established two criteria for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia:   Pain in all four quadrants of the body and in the axial skeleton (bones of the head, throat, chest and spine) that's been present on a more-or-less continuous basis for at least three months.   Pain in at least 11 of 18 tender points, which are specific spots on the body that hurt when pressure is applied. (See diagram, top right.)    Diagnosing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    No medical test can reliably detect  chronic fatigue syndrome .  The first step toward making a diagnosis is for doctors to perform tests to rule out conditions with similar symptoms, including chronic infections such as  tuberculosis ,  mononucleosis  or  Lyme ; fibromyalgia; autoimmune diseases such as  multiple sclerosis  and  lupus ; or psychiatric/emotional conditions.   Second, doctors evaluate the patient following guidelines set by the CDC:   Unexplained persistent fatigue that's not due to ongoing exertion, isn't substantially relieved by rest, is of new onset and results in a significant reduction in previous levels of activitiy.  Four or more of the following symptoms are present for six months or more:  Impaired memory or concentration  Post-exertional malaise (extreme, prolonged exhaustion and sickness following physical or mental activity)  Unrefreshing sleep  Muscle pain  Joint pain without swelling or redness  Headaches of a new type or severity  Sore throat that's frequent or recurring  Tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes     These symptoms must have been constant or recurring during at least six months of illness and must not have started before the fatigue.   To date, no medical specialty has ""claimed"" CFS.  It's up to you to  find a doctor  knowledgable about the condition.

Are you down to that final cigarette, but you just can't seem to quit?  If you are pregnant and finding that  quitting smoking  is quite a challenge, this article can help you find a way that works.  Smoking during pregnancy can have a very negative effect on both your health and the health of your baby, and could result in a number of pregnancy complications.  So here are some quitting tips to help you get rid of those cigarettes for good!   Why Quit Smoking During Pregnancy?            It is important to quit  smoking  because of the numerous health risks that the habit can cause.   Health Risks for Mother:  Cigarettes are very dangerous to the health of pregnant mothers because they contain a variety of different drugs and chemicals. Tobacco, which is used in cigarettes and pipes, is a plant product that contains small levels of the drug nicotine.  Nicotine is actually poisonous to humans if it is introduced directly to the bloodstream.  Tobacco is also prepared with over 4,000 different chemicals, which mix together in the body to form a sticky tar that envelops the lungs, skin, and hair.  Many of these chemicals are cancer-causing, and can contribute to serious health problems or even death.   Health Risks for Baby  Cigarettes are also very dangerous for your unborn baby.  Every time you smoke during pregnancy, the chemicals and nicotine that you inhale pass through baby's placenta, blocking him/her from getting any nutrients from your body.  Smoking during pregnancy has also been linked to:     preterm birth   stillbirth   low birthweight babies   breathing issues in childhood (including  asthma )   Choosing Your Quitting Method    In order to quit smoking, it is important to choose a quitting method that is right for you.  During pregnancy, there are a number of stop smoking programs that you can choose from:   Cold Turkey  The cold turkey quit method is one of the most popular ways to quit smoking.  It involves throwing out all of your cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays and trying not to smoke anymore.  The cold turkey method is one of the safest to use during pregnancy: it involves no medications and ensures that cigarette smoke and chemicals stop going into your baby's system immediately.  However, the cold turkey method can mean a lot of withdrawal symptoms, including  depression , stress, and agitation.  Therefore, this method may not be right for you, especially if you were a heavy smoker.  The cold turkey method works for 1 in 20 smokers.   Gradual Quit Method  The gradual quit method allows you to reduce the number of cigarettes that you smoke everyday, until, eventually, you aren't smoking anymore.  Like the cold turkey method, the gradual quit method is safe for pregnant women: it doesn't involve any additional medications and helps to quickly reduce the amount of nicotine and tar inside your body.  However, there may still be affects on the baby since you are still exposing your child to nasty chemicals. Additionally, it is often very difficult to say goodbye to those last lingering cigarettes, so this method may not be effective for you.  Typically, about 1 in 20 people are successful quitters with this method.   Nicotine Replacement  The nicotine replacement method makes use of smoking cessation aids that provide your body with supplies of nicotine.  Commonly used nicotine replacements include the patch (which is worn on your arm), nicotine gum (which you chew), and nicotine nasal sprays (which you spray into your nose).  Researchers aren't exactly sure if these nicotine replacements are safe to use during pregnancy.  However, because they only contain one chemical product (nicotine) they are likely much safer for baby than cigarettes are.  And smokers who use these nicotine replacements are twice as likely to quit successfully; in fact, 1 in 10 smokers quit using nicotine replacements.   Bupropion  Bupropion is an antidepressant that is often sold under the brand name Zyban and Wellbutrin.  Bupropion appears to help smokers quit their habits quite successfully; in fact, 1 in 10 smokers that use bupropion quit.  The drug hasn't been appropriately studied during pregnancy and, in large doses, the drug has been known to cause seizures.  However, if you are not at risk for seizures, your health care provider may recommend bupropion as an aid for quitting.   Counseling  Individual and group counseling sessions are available from highly trained social workers and psychologists.  These people can teach you how to quit your smoking habit by altering some of your negative thought and behavior patterns.  Some counselors also use hypnosis to help smokers quit.   Staying Strong    Quitting smoking during pregnancy is a particularly hard thing to do.  However, you can use the health of your baby as motivation to help you quit.  If you find yourself slipping back into the habit, remember:     Replace Old Habits:   If you are finding it impossible not to smoke when you see your favorite coffee shop or bus stop, try to find something else to do.  Suck on a hard candy, take up knitting, or find a new place to hang out.  Avoid triggers that set off those nicotine cravings.  And when you feel a craving coming on, try to wait it out for five minutes.  This is enough time to allow the craving to subside.   You Can't Do It Alone:   Smoking is a very challenging thing to overcome, especially when combined with all of those pregnancy symptoms and discomforts.   Don't rely on your willpower alone to get you through.  Instead, enlist the support of a friend or family member while you are quitting - they can help you through the tough times while you are trying to stop smoking.   It's Never Too Late:   Though health care providers recommend that women quit smoking before getting pregnant, many experts feel that it is unlikely that smoking will cause any damage to your child before 14 weeks.  However, even if you haven't quit by this point in your pregnancy, it is never too late.  Continue working on cutting back on your cigarette use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              About Us  |                Terms of Use and Disclaimer  |                Privacy Policy  |                Contact Us   |                Forum    |                A - Z of Pregnancy Terms  |                Advertise With Us   |                Resources  |                Suggest a Resource                                                                     American Baby Magazine  |                Baby Talk Magazine  |                Guess Your Due Date  |       Submit an Article                                       Copyright © 2001 - 2009 Pregnancy-Info.net.

Heart Attack:     Description: Occurs when the areas of the heart muscle is deprived of blood flow and oxygen for a prolonged period , usually within 20 to 30 minute, and the muscle begin to die.    Causes of Heart Attack:     Usually the result of severe narrowing or a complete block of a diseased coronary artery or plaque rupture or erosion with secondary thrombus formation. Rare causes include Embolism, dissection of the coronary artery, block blood flow to heart muscles causing a heart attack.    Symptoms/Signs of a heartattack     Chest discomfort is the most important signal of a heart attack. Discomfort can occur in other areas of upper body.     Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the neck, vomiting, back, jaws and stomach. Other signs may include sweating, nausea, lightheadedness or shortness of breath.    Be alert to the fact that in a long term follow-up of the Framingham study one third of first infarctions in men and half of those in women were clinically unrecognized. About one half of them are truly silent, but other 50% has a typical presentations.    1. The discomfort may not be severe and the patient may complain only of related symptoms, such as shortness of breath.  2. The person does not necessarily have to ""look bad""  and have all the symptoms of a heart attack to be present.  3. Stabbing , momentary twinges of pain are usually not a signals of heart attack.  4. If the patient uses the word sharp to describe the pain, ask him or her to use another word to clarify the meaning.    The Manor Controllable Risk factors of heart attack and Stroke:      Cigarette Smoking:  Cigarette smoking is the most important single cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking damages blood vessels and causes numerous other preventable diseases. Stop smoking as soon as possible. Seek help from your physician. Pick a day now to quit. It is the greatest gift you can give to your self and your dear one.    High blood pressure:   uncontrolled high blood pressure is associated with a greatest risk of heart attack and is the single most important risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can damage your blood vessels and even lead to a rupture of blood vessel in the brain. Have your blood pressure checked regularly and seek treatment if high blood pressure is noted.    High blood cholesterol:  when the excess cholesterol is deposited in the inner walls of the arteries, it can cause the arteries to narrow and obstruct blood flow to the heart or brain. Avoid a diet high in saturated fat.    Physical inactive:  a sedentary life style can lead to heart attack, but vigorous exercise by persons who have not exercised regularly can be dangerous. Consult a physician before starting an exercise.     http://www.seoserviceworld.com              By  kishan ghataliya Published: 11/2/2007             Discuss     Email Article                Use the feedback form below to submit your comments.

All rights reserved.             Fibromyalgia Facts    Fibromyalgia's defining characteristic is widespread pain that can be in any part of the body and can move to different areas.  Researchers are coming to believe that fibromyalgia may be neurologically based, and that pain is the result of the brain amplifying signals from the nerves.   The pain of fibromyalgia can be dull, stabbing, throbbing or burning. It can be constant or can come and go, and the intensity can vary as well.     Other  fibromyalgia symptoms  include fatigue, mental fog (called fibrofog),  anxiety , morning stiffness,  sleep disorders  and many more. The condition has about 60 recognized symptoms, which can vary from person to person both in number and in severity.   Things like injury, illness, stress (emotional or physical) and fatigue can make symptoms worse. Some people have specific triggers (things that increase symptoms), such as foods, chemicals or the menstrual cycle.   People with fibromyalgia also frequently have other coexisting conditions, including  chronic fatigue syndrome ,  irritable bowel syndrome ,  myofascial pain syndrome ,  rheumatoid arthritis  and  multiple sclerosis .   While fibromyalgia has only been clearly defined for a short time, people have reported the same ""mysterious"" clusters of symptoms throughout history.   People from every culture and socioeconomic level have fibromyalgia. It's most common in women over 30, but men and children can come down with it as well.   More than 6 million people in the U.S. have fibromyalgia. Many of them are too disabled to continue working.   The Social Security Administration does recognize fibromyalgia as a potentially disabling condition. However, having a  disability claim  approved is a long and difficult process that can be complicated by the ambiguous nature of fibromyalgia symptoms and the lack of diagnostic tests.   Diagnosing Fibromyalgia    So far, no test can accurately diagnose fibromyalgia. Doctors do need to rule out numerous conditions with similar symptoms before diagnosing fibromyalgia.   Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia was established in 1990 by the American College of Rheumatology. It requires widespread pain for 3 months or more and pain in at least 11 of 18 specific spots on the body, called  tender points .   Treating Fibromyalgia    The FDA has approved 2 drugs for fibromyalgia -  Lyrica (pregabalin)  and  Cymbalta (duloxetine)  - but doctors prescribe many  drugs to treat fibromyalgia . Unfortunately, common pain killers, such as anti-inflammatories ( Motrin ,  Aleve ) and narcotics ( Vicodin ,  Percocet ) are generally ineffective against the pain of fibromyalgia.   People with fibromyalgia frequently have a hard time  finding a doctor  knowledgable about fibromyalgia and how best to treat it.   Historically, fibromyalgia has most often been treated by rheumatologists. In recent years, however, neurologists, physiatrists and naturopaths have begun treating it more. People with fibromyalgia also sometimes see massage therapists, chiropractors, physical therapists and other complementary and alternative-medicine practitioners. They may also see a psychiatrist or psychologist to deal with the difficulties of a debilitating condition and possibly for depression.   Depression  is common in people with fibromyalgia, as it is in debilitating pain conditions overall. Fibromyalgia, however, is not a psychiatric condition.   Fibromyalgia sometimes gets worse over time, but sometimes stays about the same or improves.   What Causes Fibromyalgia?    We don't yet know what causes fibromyalgia. Many people develop it after being injured, while in others it may be triggered by chronic stress or as a secondary condition (in those with pre-existing chronic pain conditions.)   Fibromyalgia is officially classified as a syndrome, which means it's a collection of signs and symptoms that are known to occur together, but without a known pathology.   Fibromyalgia tends to run in families, leading researchers to believe that it has a  genetic component .   Sources:   2004 Devin J. Starlanyl.  All rights reserved.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5 :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5 :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of Santa J. Ono have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5  :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

What is Fibromyalgia?      Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, and multiple tender points, particularly in the neck, spine, shoulders, and hips. Individuals with this condition may also experience problems with sleep, morning stiffness,  irritable bowel syndrome ,  anxiety , and other symptoms.      What Causes Fibromyalgia?      It is believed by some individuals that the syndrome may be caused by an injury or trauma. This injury may affect the central nervous system. Fibromyalgia may be associated with changes in muscle metabolism, such as decreased blood flow, causing fatigue and decreased strength. Others believe the syndrome may be triggered by an infectious agent such as a virus in susceptible people, but no such agent has been identified. The cause is, essentially, still unknown.      How Is Fibromyalgia Diagnosed?       Because many of the symptoms of FMS are similar to those of other disorders it is difficult to diagnose. It becomes a diagnosis by elimination. Unfortunately this can take some time which in itself increases the stress on the sufferer. According to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), a person is considered to have fibromyalgia if he or she has widespread pain in combination with tenderness in at least 11 of 18 specific tender point sites.      The symptoms of fibromyalgia can sometimes be so painful that they prevent sufferers from going to work, attending school classes, or just managing their daily routines. Unfortunately, there is no cure available for fibromyalgia syndrome, so patients often resort to numerous different treatments to lessen the severity of their symptoms.  However, hypnosis is now emerging as one of the best alternative treatments available for fibromyalgia pain.  The use of hypnosis has been proven to reduce pain symptoms and it has become a doctor-recommended treatment. If you are suffering from fibromyalgia pain symptoms, consider hypnosis as a treatment option.      Effects of Hypnosis on Fibromyalgia Sufferers     Many fibromyalgia sufferers attribute reduction in their symptoms to the power of hypnosis. Fibromyalgia sufferers often use hypnosis as a way to limit their pain symptoms and increase their energy and comfort level. A study conducted by the NIH showed that fibromyalgia sufferers undergoing hypnosis reported 80% fewer pain symptoms than those who received no hypnosis treatment. Other benefits of hypnosis include:            decreased muscle pain        decreased morning fatigue        fewer sleep problems        increased relaxation         How can hypnosis help my body aches and bad sleep patterns?         Working at the subconscious level, hypnosis can help you learn to manage your pain. It can keep you motivated to do the exercises needed for flexibility and movement. It can help you function for longer periods of time. Hypnotherapy will very quickly help you to get restful sleep - one of the most important factors in improving your quality of life.                       Can I use hypnosis and regular medical care together?        Yes. Hypnotherapy is a complimentary therapy and does not take the place of qualified medical care. Hypnotherapy is one of a number of tools available to help alleviate painful symptoms and help your body to work at its best. You can become more relaxed through the day and thus be better able to focus and concentrate. Your experience of life can be enhanced.        Any indivuals wishing to use hypnosis to assist in symtomatic relief of fybromyalgia must first have been diagnosed with the condition. The diagnosing physition will be kept informed of your improvements so that they are able to continue monitoring your overall health.

Journal of Rheumatology 1999 Jan;18(1):72-5                     Department of Rheumatology, Sint Antonius Ziekenhuis, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands.                     In a controlled study, 40 patients with refractory fibromyalgia were randomly allocated to treatment with either hypnotherapy or physical therapy for 12 weeks with followup at 24 weeks. Compared with the patients in the physical therapy group, the patients in the hypnotherapy group showed a significantly better outcome with respect to their pain experience, fatigue on awakening, sleep pattern and ovweall wellbeing both at 12 and 24 weeks.

By  Anne Asher , About.com Updated: January 22, 2008 About.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by our  Medical Review Board      Filed In: Chronic Back - Neck Pain                  Question:  What is the Difference Between  Myofascial Pain Syndrome and Fibromyalgia? Myofascial pain syndrome and fibromyalgia are two different muscle pain conditions, each involving  palpable  “points.”  Aside from crossover –- 72% of people with fibromyalgia also have  active trigger points , one of the main symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome  -- most of the remaining symptoms in each could not be more distinct from one another. Answer:  Fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia is also known as chronic “widespread pain.”  This type of pain is usually felt in all four limbs and in the trunk.  The American College of Rheumatology classifies chronic widespread pain as fibromyalgia if it is also accompanied by the confirmed presence of at least 11 out of 18 (pre-identified) tender points.  These tender points are  1 centimeter areas in specific muscles  which are very sensitive to the touch.  Pain from tender points is local, that is, it goes no further than the tender point itself.  When comparing fibromyalgia patients to those with widespread pain but no tender points, research shows that the presence of the extra sensitive tender points is linked to greater pain, more severe symptoms and a more pronounced decrease in the quality of life.  Fibromyalgia patients often complain of fatigue, sleep problems, headaches and mood disturbances.   The muscles of fibromyalgia patients have been described by experts as “soft and doughy,” and there is excessive  range of motion  in the joints.   Fibromyalgia  occurs mostly in females.  The female to male ratio is between 4 and 9: 1.    Myofascial Pain Syndrome Myofascial pain syndrome is defined by  trigger points , which are felt as taut bands of muscle.  The trigger points refer pain to other (nearby) locations in the body.  When pressed, trigger points illicit a twitch response, also known as a “jump sign.”  One of the main characteristics of myofascial pain syndrome is that the pain is regional, or confined to a limited area of the body.  Generally, myofascial pain will be found in the shoulders, neck, arms, face, low back and/or legs.  It is quite often a result of  misaligned posture .     Myofascial pain syndrome can be treated in a number of ways, including injections, stretching with the use of a cooling spray (a method called spray and stretch), and specific manual or  massage techniques  that eradicate the trigger points.     People with myofascial pain and trigger points tend to have tight muscles and limited flexibility.  Myofascial pain syndrome occurs in an approximately 1:1 male to female ratio.   Summarizing the Differences Between Myofascial Pain Syndrome and Fibromyalgia As we have seen, fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome are two very different problems.  Fibromyalgia is a widespread pain syndrome accompanied by fatigue and muscle tenderness. These symptoms are  not  associated with  inflammation . Treating fibromyalgia is often multidisplinary, for example, you may need gentle to moderate exercise, counseling, and anti-depressants all at the same time.  Myofascial pain, on the other hand, is the condition of muscles that occurs when trigger points cause reduced functioning in  soft tissue , and pain.  Myofascial pain syndrome benefits from treatments that are physical in nature, such as  manual medicine  and restorative movement aimed at improving  postural alignment .     Research also supports the use of injections as a way to relieve pain from trigger points.  For people with tender points alone however, treatment with injections has not shown to be very effective.  This is one notable difference between fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome as published in medical literature.  So, if you are considering injections for myofascial pain or for fibromyalgia, ask your doctor for more information.       Sources:   Rachlin, E.

Swierzewski, III, M.D.    Last Reviewed: 01 Dec 2007         Original Source:  http://www.cardiologychannel.com/heartattack/index.shtml          Home  »  Heart Attack  »  Overview, Signs, Symptoms, and What to Do                     Questions to Ask Your Cardiac Care Team (Free Handout)   Overview             Advertising Disclaimer     The heart is a complex, highly specialized, muscular organ in the chest that maintains the circulation of blood throughout the body. Heart attack, or  acute myocardial infarction , is the death of heart tissue caused by a complete blockage in one of the arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries), resulting in an interruption in the blood supply to the heart.     When heart tissue is deprived of blood-borne oxygen for longer than 30 minutes (called  ischemia ), it begins to die. Ischemia causes electrical instability within the chambers of the heart, preventing the heart from adequately pumping blood throughout the body (called ventricular fibrillation). Permanent brain damage and  death  can occur when the brain is deprived of blood flow for longer than 5 minutes.       In most cases, blockage occurs as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called  atherosclerosis , a condition in which plaques (deposits of cholesterol and fatty material) build up in the arteries and partially or completely block blood flow. When the surface of a plaque tears or ruptures, a blood clot (thrombus) can form and completely block the flow of blood in the artery.    Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) , also called sudden cardiac death, occurs when the heart develops an abnormal rhythm (arrhythmia; e.g., ventricular fibrillation) that causes it to stop beating suddenly. In as many as 95% of cases, a person who experiences SCA dies, usually within minutes.     Incidence and Prevalence    According to the American Heart Association, coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States; and, in adults, heart attacks cause 1 out of every 5 deaths.  According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) more than 1.2 million heart attacks occur each year in the United States and about 460,000 of these are fatal. Approximately 300,000 people die annually from heart attacks before they can receive medical treatment.    According to the World Health Organization (WHO), coronary heart disease accounts for about 17 million (approximately 30%) deaths annually throughout the world.  It is estimated that by the year 2010, heart disease will be the leading cause of death in the world.      Risk Factors and Causes      The primary risk factor for heart attack is  coronary heart disease  (CHD), also called atherosclerosis.  Atherosclerosis  is a condition in which plaques (deposits of cholesterol and fatty materials) form in the arteries and partially or completely block blood flow.  When a plaque tears or ruptures, a blood clot (thrombus) can form and completely block the flow of blood to the heart.  Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot in a coronary artery.    Many of the risk factors for CHD and subsequent heart attack are related to being overweight. Risk factors include the following:    Age (over 55)   Diabetes   Elevated levels of certain amino acids and proteins (e.g., homocysteine, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen)    Gender (male)   Heredity (family history of heart disease)   High blood pressure  (hypertension)   High fat diet   High levels of ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol and low levels of ""good"" (HDL) cholesterol    Lack of exercise   Smoking   Stress (e.g., ""type A"" or driven personality)      In some cases, heart attack is caused by a severe spasm (contraction) in a coronary artery.  During a spasm, the artery narrows and blood flow to an area of the heart decreases or stops.  The cause of spasms is unknown, and one can occur in normal arteries as well as those partially blocked by atherosclerosis.               Advertising Disclaimer      The following also may cause heart attack:     Complications from bypass surgery or  cardiac catheterization   Congenital heart conditions (i.e., conditions present at birth)   Coronary embolization (blood clot from elsewhere in the body that breaks away and travels to the heart)   Drug abuse (e.g., cocaine use may impede blood flow in the heart)    Inflammatory artery disease (indicated by the presence of markers in the blood such as interleukin-18 [IL-18] or C-reactive protein [CRP])   Trauma (cut, severe blow, or stab wound to the heart)      About one-quarter of all heart attacks occur without producing any identifiable symptoms. These so-called ""silent"" heart attacks may only be discovered incidentally by examination of an electrocardiogram (EKG) or by other heart test.      Signs and Symptoms    A heart attack is a  medical emergency  and prompt treatment increases the chance for survival. If you suspect that you or someone around you is experiencing a heart attack,  seek medical attention immediately .    Symptoms of heart attack vary considerably, even in patients who have experienced a previous heart attack.  Heart attack can occur suddenly and cause severe, intense symptoms; however, most begin slowly and cause mild discomfort that may come and go.      In some cases, the condition does not produce symptoms (called ""silent heart attack"") and is diagnosed incidentally by an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This occurs more often in patients with diabetes.    Warning signs  of a heart attack include the following:     Uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing, or pain in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back    Pain or discomfort that radiates to other areas of the upper body (e.g., one or both arms, shoulders, back, neck, jaw, or abdomen)   Shortness of breath (may occur prior to chest pain, may accompany it, or may occur without it)    Lightheadedness or fainting (may occur with or without chest pain)   Cold sweat or paleness (may occur with or without chest pain)   Nausea (may occur with or without chest pain)       Additional  symptoms include the following:     Clamminess   Indigestion   Intense sweating   Unexplained anxiety, weakness, or fatigue      © 1998-2008 Healthcommunities.com, Inc.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5 :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5 :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

A syndrome is a collection of symptoms. If you have been diagnosed or have signs and symptoms pointing to fibromyalgia, there are 10 basic facts you should know about fibromyalgia.    1 - Fibromyalgia is primarily characterized by widespread muscle pain and tenderness.   Fibromyalgia does not cause inflammation or damage to the joints, muscles, or other tissues. Therefore, it is not a disease of the joints but is arthritis-related. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology established criteria to diagnose fibromyalgia:    A history of widespread pain in all four quadrants of the body (e.g. above the waist on both sides; below the waist on both sides of the body) for three months or more.    Pain at 11 of 18  tender point  sites   How to Recognize Signs and Symptoms of Fibromyalgia    2 - Fibromyalgia can occur as a primary or secondary condition.   Fibromyalgia can occur as a primary syndrome characterized by muscular pain or as a secondary syndrome to other rheumatic diseases.  It is possible to have fibromyalgia syndrome as well as another rheumatic disease.   Patients with  rheumatoid arthritis ,  systemic lupus erythematosus , or  ankylosing spondylitis  are at increased risk of also developing fibromyalgia syndrome. Those patients may wonder if they have symptoms which are common to two conditions (i.e. overlapping symptoms) or if they actually have two distinct conditions.   Test Your Knowledge: Fibromyalgia   Fibromyalgia vs. Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain: What Factors Determine Treatment?      3 - Fibromyalgia is often misunderstood and symptoms are often unrecognized, causing the syndrome to remain undiagnosed for months or years.   Fibromyalgia symptoms are often confused with symptoms typically linked to another condition. Fibromyalgia symptoms can mimic or overlap symptoms associated with other rheumatic diseases. According to the National Fibromyalgia Association, it takes about five years on average to get an accurate diagnosis of fibromyalgia.    Fibromyalgia Screening Quiz    4 - Ninety percent of fibromyalgia patients suffer with severe fatigue or a sleep disorder.   Fatigue  and sleep problems are a major characteristic associated with fibromyalgia.  Therefore, problems which develop because of poor sleep, also referred to as non-restorative sleep, are problematic as well (i.e. cognitive problems, memory lapses, lack of energy).   What is Chronic Fatigue?   I'm Tired of Being Tired     5 - Fibromyalgia is associated with additional symptoms which seem distinct themselves but are actually included in fibromyalgia syndrome.   Other than muscular pain, fatigue, and tenderness, fibromyalgia patients also may experience:   headaches   irritable bladder or bowel   memory problems   temporomandibular joint disorder   pelvic pain   noise sensitivity    temperature sensitivity   restless leg syndrome   depression   anxiety    6 - There are psychological as well as physical aspects associated with fibromyalgia.   In a study of 307 patients evaluated over an 11-year period (reported at an American College of Rheumatology meeting by Yunus and colleagues), one-third of patients had severe physical as well as severe psychological issues. One-third had mild psychological and moderate physical issues. Another third had moderate pyschological symptoms with mild physical symptoms.     7 - Since there is so much variability in fibromyalgia, the syndrome does not manifest itself identically in all patients.   Since not all fibromyalgia patients experience the same symptoms, there may be sub-types of fibromyalgia which may be discovered later and would influence treatment choices. Until the cause of fibromyalgia is determined, the variability of symptoms will remain part of the puzzle.      Fibromyalgia - Researching the Cause    8 - Diagnosis of fibromyalgia focuses on tender points but there is no definitive diagnostic test for fibromyalgia such as a blood test or X-ray.   Diagnosis of fibromyalgia is solely based on symptoms which are presented and on a physical examination. If diagnostic tests are ordered, it is to rule out other conditions or find out more about other symptoms.    How is Fibromyalgia Diagnosed?       9 - Medication and non-medication treatments are used to manage fibromyalgia.   Medications are used to treat pain, improve sleep, and manage depression and anxiety. Your physician will determine what to prescribe based on symptoms presented. Alternative treatments which focus on pain relief and stress relief also benefit many fibromyalgia patients.   How is Fibromyalgia Treated?   Fibromyalgia Medication Options    10 - Fibromyalgia affects more women than men. The prevalence of fibromyalgia is between 2 and 4 percent of the population.    Though the statistics reveal the prevalence of fibromyalgia, statistics do not reveal how many people live well with fibromyalgia and have successfully managed the syndrome to the degree of maintaining good quality of life. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and to follow a treatment regiment which affords you a good quality of life despite your diagnosis.

Chest                discomfort.  Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the                center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or goes                away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable                pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain.                                        Discomfort                in other areas of the upper body.  Can include pain or discomfort                in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach.                                        Shortness                of breath.  Often comes along with chest discomfort. But                it also can occur before chest discomfort.                                        Other                symptoms.  May include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea,                or light-headedness.                                                Acting In Time To          Heart Attack Symptoms                  A heart attack is a frightening event, and you probably don't want to          think about it. But, if you learn the signs of a heart attack and what          steps to take, you can save a life–maybe your own.         What are the signs of a heart attack? Many people think a heart attack          is sudden and intense, like a ""movie"" heart attack, where a          person clutches his or her chest and falls over.         The truth is that many heart attacks start slowly, as a mild pain or          discomfort. If you feel such a symptom, you may not be sure what's wrong.          Your symptoms may even come and go. Even those who have had a heart attack          may not recognize their symptoms, because the next attack can have entirely          different ones.           Women          Heart Attack Symptoms         If you're          a woman, you may not believe you're as vulnerable to a heart attack as          men–but you are. Women account for nearly half of all heart attack          deaths. Heart disease is the number one killer of both women and men.         There are          differences in how women and men respond to a heart attack. Women are          less likely than men to believe they're having a heart attack and more          likely to delay in seeking emergency treatment.         Further,          women tend to be about 10 years older than men when they have a heart          attack. They are more likely to have other conditions, such as diabetes,          high blood pressure, and congestive heart failure–making it all the          more vital that they get proper treatment fast.         Women should          learn the heart attack warning signs. These are:                   Pain or            discomfort in the center of the chest.                                   Pain or            discomfort in other areas of the upper body, including the arms, back,            neck, jaw, or stomach.                                   Other            symptoms, such as a shortness of breath, breaking out in a cold sweat,            nausea, or lightheadedness                 As with men,          women's most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort.          But women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the          other common symptoms, particularly shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting,          and back or jaw pain.         If you feel          heart attack symptoms, do not delay. Remember, minutes matter! Do not          wait for more than a few minutes–5 minutes at most–to call 9-1-1.          Your family will benefit most if you seek fast treatment.          To learn more about women and heart disease:         Healthy          Heart Handbook for Women.                     National Women's Health          Information Center                  Learn the signs–but also remember: Even if you're not sure it's          a heart attack, you should still have it checked out. Fast action can          save lives-maybe your own.           [ Top ]         Surviving          Heart Attack Symptoms         How do you          survive a heart attack? Fast action is your best weapon against a heart          attack. Why? Because clot-busting drugs and other artery-opening treatments          can stop a heart attack in its tracks. They can prevent or limit damage          to the heart–but they need to be given immediately after symptoms          begin. The sooner they are started, the more good they will do–and          the greater the chances are for survival and a full recovery. To be most          effective, they need to be given ideally within 1 hour of the start of          heart attack symptoms.         [ Top ]         Heart          Attack Uncertainty Is Normal           Expectations          often don't match reality when it comes to heart attack. People expect          a heart attack to happen as it does in the movies, where someone clutches          his or her chest in pain and falls over. Because of this expectation,          people often are not sure if they're having a heart attack. As a result,          people often take a wait-and-see approach instead of seeking care at once.          This even happens to people who have already had a heart attack. They          may not recognize the symptoms, because their next heart attack can have          entirely different symptoms.         [ Top ]         Call          9-1-1           The first          step to take when a heart attack happens is to  call 9-1-1.  Call          whether you're sure you're having a heart attack or not.         Anyone showing          heart attack warning signs needs to receive medical treatment right away.           Don't wait more than a few minutes—5 minutes at most—to          call 9-1-1.         Calling 9-1-1          for an ambulance is the best way to get to the hospital because:                                              Emergency                medical personnel (also called EMS, for emergency medical services)                can begin treatment immediately–even before arrival at the                hospital.                                        The                heart may stop beating during a heart attack. This is called sudden                cardiac arrest. Emergency personnel have the equipment needed to                start the heart beating again.                                        Heart                attack patients who arrive by ambulance tend to receive faster treatment                on their arrival at the hospital.                                       If for some          reason, you are having heart attack symptoms and cannot call  9-1-1,           have someone else drive you at once to the hospital. Never drive yourself          to the hospital, unless you absolutely have no other choice.         [ Top ]         Emergency          Medical Personnel         Calling 9-1-1          is like bringing a hospital emergency department to your door. Why?         Emergency          medical personnel can take vital signs, determine your medical condition,          and if needed give added medical care.         In many places,          emergency medical personnel are linked to hospitals and doctors, so they          can relay your vital signs and electrocardiogram to the emergency department          before you arrive. This way, you receive immediate continued treatment          by emergency department personnel once you reach the hospital.         Emergency          medical personnel can give a variety of treatments and medications at          the scene. Emergency medical personnel carry drugs and equipment that          can help your medical condition, including oxygen, heart medications (such          as nitroglycerin), pain relief treatments (such as morphine), and defibrillators          (equipment that restarts the heart if it stops beating).         Limiting          Heart Muscle Damage         Treatments          for a heart attack work to open the blocked artery to restore blood flow          as fast as possible to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle, and          to lessen the chance of a repeat attack. The main treatments are thrombolytic          (""clot-busting"") therapy, other medications, and special procedures,          such as angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery.         To be most          effective, these treatments must be given fast–within 1 hour of the          start of heart attack symptoms. Acting fast can save your life and limit          damage to your heart.         [ Top ]         Plan          Ahead         Make a plan          now for what you would do if a heart attack should happen. Doing so will          save time and could help save a life.         To plan ahead:                            Learn            the  heart attack warning signs.                       Think            through what you would do if you had heart attack symptoms. Decide what            you would do if it happened while you were at home, in the middle of            the night, at work, or at any other place or in any other situation            that might need advance planning.                       Decide            who would care for any dependents in an emergency. Emergency medical            personnel will generally contact a friend or relative (or the police            department, if necessary) to make emergency arrangements for your dependents.           Talk with            your family and friends about the heart attack warning signs and the            importance of acting fast by calling 9-1-1 after a few minutes–5            at the most–if those signs persist. Explain the benefits of calling            9-1-1, instead of getting to the hospital by car.                       Talk to            your health care provider about your heart attack risk and what you            can do to reduce it. ( Rate your chances of having a            heart attack. )                       Talk to            your doctor about what you should do if you experience any heart attack            symptoms.                       Gather            important information to take along with you to the hospital. Do this            by  preparing a heart attack            survival plan.  Fill in the form, print it out, and keep copies in            handy places, such as your wallet or purse.                       If you            are concerned about your insurance coverage, call your insurance company            and check on your benefits. Most insurance companies cover emergency            care for a possible heart attack.                 [ Top ]          Testing          For A Heart Attack         If you think        youe having a heart attack, get help at once. Don wait to be sure. Call        9-1-1 right away. Delay can be deadly.    Once          you get help, you will undergo tests to see if a heart attack has actually          occurred. Some tests are done at the hospital, while others can be done          by emergency medical personnel who come in an ambulance.          Key heart          attack tests are:                                              •                 Electrocardiogram                  (ECG or EKG).  This is a graphic record of the electrical                  activity of the heart as it contracts and relaxes. The ECG can                  detect abnormal heartbeats, some areas of damage, inadequate blood                  flow, and heart enlargement.                                        •                 Blood                  test.                   A blood test will be done routinely to check for enzymes or other                  substances that are released when cells begin to die. These are                  ""markers"" of the amount of damage to your heart.                                        •                 Nuclear                  scan.                   This test shows areas of the heart that lack blood flow and are                  damaged. It also can reveal problems with the heart pumping                  action. A small amount of radioactive material is injected into                  a vein, usually in the arm. A scanning camera positioned over                  the heart records whether the nuclear material is taken up by                  the heart muscle (healthy areas) or not (damaged areas). The camera                  also can evaluate how well the heart muscle pumps blood. This                  test can be done during both rest and exercise, enhancing the                  usefulness of its results.                                        •                 Coronary                  angiography (or arteriography).                   This test is used to check blockages and narrowed areas inside                  coronary arteries. A fine tube (catheter) is threaded through                  an artery of an arm or leg up into the heart. A dye that shows                  up on X ray is then injected into the blood vessel, and the vessels                  and heart are filmed as the heart pumps. The picture is called                  an angiogram or arteriogram.

Heart          Disease Prevention - CoQ10         By  Decker Weiss :        NMD, AACVPR   More          than 40% of all deaths in the U.S. are from cardiovascular disease (CVD).          You have a greater chance of dying from heart disease than from cancer,          AIDS, diabetes, and accidents combined. More than 2,600 Americans die          each day of CVD—an average of 1 death every 33 seconds. One in 5          men and women have some form of CVD. If all forms of major CVD were eliminated,          life expectancy would rise by almost 7 years.1          One of the          most—if not the most—important things people can do to improve          their overall health and life expectancy is to improve their heart health.          Diet, exercise, and the wise use of dietary supplements can improve heart          health dramatically. 2 One dietary supplement that’s extremely beneficial          to heart health is coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).3           What is          CoQ10?          CoQ10 is          a natural, fat-soluble nutrient present in virtually all cells. CoQ10          also is known as ubiquinone. That’s because CoQ10 is ubiquitous and          exists everywhere there is life. CoQ10 is vital to adenosine triphosphate          (ATP) production.4 ATP is the energy-rich compound used for all energy          requiring processes in the body. Although CoQ10 is produced by the body          and exists in some dietary sources, these levels may be insufficient to          meet the body’s requirements. CoQ10 levels diminish with age and          as a result of dietary inadequacies and various disease states.4-6 Also,          some drugs, especially a group of cholesterol lowering prescription drugs          known as “statins,” (Pravachol®, Zocor®, Lipitor®,          etc.) significantly reduce CoQ10 levels in the body.7,8          For what          health conditions is CoQ10 used?          CoQ10 is          beneficial in treating and preventing CVD and conditions such as high          blood pressure,9 atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries),10 angina,11          and congestive heart failure (CHF).12 It’s been shown that heart          attacks tend to occur when CoQ10 levels are low in the body.13 In addition,          CoQ10 is beneficial for diabetes,14 immune dysfunction,15 cancer,16 periodontal          disease,17 prostate cancer,18 and neurological disease.19          Why is          CoQ10 especially important to heart health?          The heart          is one of the most metabolically active tissues in the body. In the average          person, the heart propels 2,000 gallons of blood through 65,000 miles          of blood vessels by beating 100,000 times each day.20 Thus, it requires          large amounts of uninterrupted energy. Heart cells have a greater number          of mitochondria, and subsequently, more CoQ10 than any other type of cell.21,22          Each heart cell can have thousands of mitochondria to meet these energy          demands.23         Mitochondria          are highly specialized structures within each cell and are often referred          to as cell powerhouses. These tiny energy-producers produce 95% of the          energy the body requires. The number of mitochondria in a cell depends          on its function and energy needs. A cell’s ATP production is dependent          on adequate amounts of CoQ10.21,22         Heart disease          patients are commonly CoQ10 deficient. Correcting such deficiencies often          can produce amazing results.24 The presence of supplemental CoQ10 is a          key to the heart’s optimum performance.25         In people          who have had a heart attack (myocardial infarction), CoQ10 assists in          repairing the heart muscle and restoring heart function. This is due to          increased ATP production.26          What CoQ10          studies support this fact?          A 1998 study          found CoQ10 can provide rapid protective effects in patients with a heart          attack if administered within three days of the onset of symptoms. The          study focused on patients admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial          infarction (AMI) diagnosis. Seventy-three patients received CoQ10 (120          mg/d). The study’s control group consisted of 71 similarly matched          patients with acute AMI. After treatment, angina pectoris (severe chest          pain signifying interrupted blood flow to the heart), total arrhythmia          (dangerously irregular heartbeats), and poor function in the left ventricle          (the essential chamber of the heart) were significantly reduced in the          CoQ10 group compared to the placebo group. Total deaths due to sudden          cardiac failure and nonfatal heart attacks also were significantly reduced          in the CoQ10 group compared with the placebo group.27         In another          study, CoQ10 was studied in 109 patients with high blood pressure (hypertension).          The patients were given varying doses of supplemental CoQ10 with the goal          of attaining a certain blood level (greater than 2.0 mcg/l). Most patients          were on medications to treat hypertension. Half the patients were able          to stop taking one to three antihypertensive drugs at an average of 4.4          months after starting CoQ10. Only 3% of patients required the addition          of one antihypertensive drug. The 9.4% of patients who had echo cardiograms,          performed both before and during treatment, experienced a highly significant          improvement in heart wall thickness and function. This improvement was          directly attributed to CoQ10 supplementation.28         Congestive          heart failure  (CHF) is a debilitating disease that affects 5 million          people in the US It causes edema, difficult breathing, and impaired circulation.          In another study, CoQ10 restored healthy heart function in CHF patients.          Patients received 100 mg of CoQ10 or a placebo twice daily for 12 weeks.          Before and after the treatment period, the investigators introduced a          catheter into the right ventricle of patients’ hearts to determine          the degree of CHF damage to the heart muscle. The patients’ heart          muscles at rest and work improved significantly. The researchers concluded          CHF patients would greatly benefit from adjunctive CoQ10 treatment.29          I’ve          heard that CoQ10 can also help people who have neurological diseases.          Is this true?          Yes, it          is. CoQ10 has been studied for its ability to improve the health of individuals          with amotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),30 Parkinson’s disease,31          and Huntington’s disease.32 A recently completed study sponsored          by the National Institutes of Health showed that CoQ10 caused a slowing          of the progression of Huntington’s disease, a devastating and degenerative          disease that is always fatal. In fact, no other medication, drug, or nutritional          supplement has ever been shown to cause a decline in the progression of          this terrible disease.         The study          compared CoQ10 against remacemide (an investigational HD drug made by          AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals), in 347 HD patients who were in the early          stages of the disease. Remacemide blocks glutamate, the neurotransmitter          scientists think may cause the death of brain cells that occurs in Huntington’s          disease.33 While remacemide had no effect on the progression of HD, CoQ10          showed a trend toward slowing the disease by an average of 15%. This meant          the HD group taking CoQ10 was able to handle every day activities of life          a little longer than the patients taking remacemide or a placebo. They          also were able to focus their attention better, were less depressed, and          less irritable. The 15% slowing of decline means that CoQ10 can result          in about one more year of independence for HD patients.32 Needless to          say, the gift of an additional year of health in the lives of HD patients          is incredibly significant.         Because of          these impressive results with HD, researchers are hopeful that the studies          of CoQ10 in those with ALS and Parksinson’s disease will similarly          have a positive effect on the symptoms and/or progression of these neurological          disorders, too.          Why is          it crucial for a CoQ10 supplement to cross the blood-brain barrier?          The brain’s          blood vessels are composed of cells with extremely tight junctions. These          junctions form the blood-brain barrier, which restricts what can pass          from the bloodstream into the brain. While this barrier protects the brain,          it can be a significant obstacle to central nervous system disorder therapy.          To leave the bloodstream and reach the brain cells, a substance must pass          through the tightly connected cells of the capillary walls. Only substances          with unique solubility or those with a transport system can cross the          blood-brain barrier to a significant degree.34-36 As a result, crossing          the blood-brain barrier presents a significant challenge to supporting          neurological health.         While most          CoQ10 supplements enter the bloodstream and increase blood serum levels,          only special forms of CoQ10 have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier.37          For CoQ10 to enter the mitochondria within the brain, CoQ10 must first          cross the blood-brain barrier to produce significant neurosupportive clinical          results.          How can          one supplement have applications for neurological diseases, heart health,          and even the immune system?          Supplements          often have more than one function, especially when it’s a substance          like CoQ10, which is present in all parts of the body. All nucleated cells          (most cells other than red blood cells) have mitochondria and all cells          require energy to function. CoQ10 is vital to ATP production.21,22 Thus,          CoQ10 has applications not only in neurological (neurons or nervous system          cells) and cardiac health (myocardium or heart tissue), but also for the          immune system.38          Are all          CoQ10 supplements created equal? Doesn’t CoQ10 just have to get into          the bloodstream to be effective?          There are          some important distinctions among CoQ10 products, as they vary greatly          in quality and absorbability. It’s crucial to find a CoQ10 product          that’s:         1. Scientifically          shown to absorb through the digestive tract, cross cellular membranes,          and increase mitochondrial levels of CoQ10. Chewable forms of CoQ10 provide          rapid bioavailability and absorption. Serum level determination of CoQ10          in the bloodstream is not necessarily the most important measure of efficacy.          For a CoQ10 supplement to be fully effective, it must cross the cellular          barrier and raise intracellular CoQ10 levels. A key indicator of effective          CoQ10 supplementation is its presence in cell mitochondria37         2. The natural          form of CoQ10. The natural process uses living organisms. CoQ10 also can          be synthesized by a chemical process, which produces a distinctly different          product that contains chemical compounds not found in the natural form.         3. Formulated          with ingredients that provide the transport system CoQ10 needs to cross          cellular membranes and the blood-brain barrier. Not all forms of CoQ10          have been scientifically proven to cross cell membranes and the blood-brain          barrier.37 Some prestigious groups that have investigated this issue include          researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.37         4. Studied          by respected organizations, with research published in peer-reviewed journals          by reputable scientists.          How much          CoQ10 should I take?          Take 100          to 200 mg of CoQ10 daily, depending on your family history of heart disease          and personal heart disease experience.         CoQ10’s          safety has been evaluated. Dosages in studies have ranged from 100 mg          to 1,200 mg per day. To date, no toxicities have been reported.39,40 Occasional          mild stomach upset may occur. Taking CoQ10 with meals usually alleviates          this rare effect.          What are          some other heart-friendly supplements?          CoQ10 is          an excellent supplement for overall cardiovascular health, as is L-carnitine.          L-carnitine is the naturally occurring form of carnitine that’s found          in food and synthesized in the body. Much of the body’s L-carnitine          is found in the heart and skeletal muscle, tissues that rely on fatty          acid oxidation for most of their energy. Nearly 70% of the energy needed          for heart function is derived from fatty acid breakdown.41 Proper L-carnitine          supplementation transports fatty acids into cell mitochondria, where it’s          burned for energy. L-carnitine is an excellent addition to CoQ10, especially          for people with heart disease, and has been shown to improve many symptoms          associated with CVD. In one study, people who had experienced one heart          attack received either L-carnitine or placebo. The L-carnitine group had          a statistically significant reduction in second heart attacks, and improved          overall survival.42          What supplements          support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol?          In addition          to maintaining overall cardiovascular health, it’s also important          to address your essential fats/lipids levels and healthy circulation/blood          pressure.2 Fish oil supplements can significantly reduce blood pressure,          cholesterol, and homocysteine levels.43-52 Choose a supplement that’s          a rich source of EPA and DHA, omega-3 fatty acids naturally obtainable          in fish oil. Find a product that’s been clinically studied and purified          to ensure it contains the beneficial active constituents of the whole          oil, while removing any dioxins, DDT, PCBs, or heavy metals, toxins present          in some commercial fish oil preparations.53 An enteric-coated garlic product          that provides a minimum of 5,000 mcg of beneficial allicin supports healthy          blood pressure and circulation. And magnesium, niacin, vitamin E, folic          acid, hawthorn extract, and L-cysteine provide overall nutritional support          to the heart and vascular system.          Heart Health          Conclusion - CoQ10         CoQ10 is          not the only answer to the complex issues of heart disease, neurological          diseases, or immune dysfunction; however, research indicates that it’s          a bigger piece of the puzzle than physicians and scientists ever imagined.          The more we study this naturally occurring compound, the more benefits          we find.         The key to          this supplement is the manufacturing quality. For safety and overall effectiveness,          use a CoQ10 product that’s supported by product-specific research          from reputable institutions. Choose tested products from a well respected          company to increase your potential to achieve and maintain heart and blood          vessel health.         Supplementation          with clinically studied products can have a major impact on your heart’s          health and strength. However, no supplement replaces the need to eat a          healthful diet low in refined foods (especially sugar), and saturated          fats, and to exercise your most important muscle—your heart—on          a regular  basis.

As a matter of fact, heart disease -- including heart attacks -- is the leading cause of death among women.

This may be one reason why research studies show that women are less likely to recognize the  symptoms of a heart attack .       Consider the following statistics about women and heart attacks:             One in three American women dies of  heart disease  or a heart attack (1 in 23 women die from  breast cancer )                    Women account for nearly one half of all heart attack deaths                    Thirty-eight percent of women will die within 1 year after having a heart attack                    Within six years of having a heart attack, about 46 percent of women become disabled with  heart failure                     Two thirds of women who have a heart attack fail to make a full recovery.                  It is true that women usually have heart attacks about 10 years later than men. It is also true that  symptoms of a heart attack in women  can be different than symptoms in men.         Women and Heart Attack Symptoms                                                                                                                                                                                                         Common symptoms of a heart attack in women include:               Pain or discomfort (often a pressure-like pain) in or around the chest, shoulders, jaw, neck, back, or arms. It may feel like a squeezing, pressing sensation in the chest.        Indigestion or  heartburn -type sensation  (see  Heartburn or Heart Attack? ).         Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach).        Fatigue.        Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air).        Sweating.        Light-headedness.        Weakness.                  In about 20 percent of heart attack cases, women do not have pain or discomfort. They may just experience some of the other symptoms, such as shortness or breath or nausea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ( Women and Heart Attacks Continued: Page 2 )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Add this article to your Favorites                            Email this article                            Print                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Written by/reviewed by: Arthur Schoenstadt, MD                                                           Last reviewed by: Arthur Schoenstadt, MD                                                                                                                                  Other Articles in This eMedTV Presentation                                                                                                                                          Women and Heart Disease                                            Risk Factors for Heart Disease in Women                                            Symptoms of Heart Disease in Women                                            Heart Attack                                            Causes of Heart Attack                                            Heart Attack and Smoking                                             Cholesterol and Heart Attack                                            Heart Attack Warning Signs                                            Early Heart Attack Symptoms                                            Heart Attack Symptoms                                            Heartburn or Heart Attack?

While symptoms may include the classic heart attack symptoms (such as chest pain), classic symptoms appear less commonly in women. Common symptoms of a heart attack in women include indigestion or heartburn-type sensation, fatigue, and weakness. Other symptoms include trouble sleeping, problems breathing, and anxiety. Up to 20 percent of women who have a heart attack will have mild discomfort or no pain at all.

This may explain one reason why research studies show that women are less likely to recognize the  symptoms of a heart attack . Consider the following statistics:             One in three American women dies of  heart disease  or a heart attack (1 in 23 women die from  breast cancer )                    Thirty-eight percent of women will die within 1 year after having a heart attack                    Within 6 years of having a heart attack, about 46 percent of women become disabled with  heart failure                     Two thirds of women who have a heart attack fail to make a full recovery.                  It is true that women usually have heart attacks later in life than men do. It is also true that  heart attack symptoms  in women can be different from symptoms commonly seen in men.         Common Heart Attack Symptoms in Women                                                                                                                                                                                                         Common symptoms of a heart attack in women include:               Pain or discomfort (often a pressure-like pain) in or around the chest, shoulders, jaw, neck, back or arms. It may feel like a squeezing, pressing sensation in the chest.                    Indigestion or  heartburn -type sensation  (see  Heartburn or Heart Attack? ) .                    Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach).                    Fatigue.                    Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air).                    Sweating.                    Light-headedness.                    Weakness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ( Symptoms of a Heart Attack in Women Continued: Page 2 )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Add this article to your Favorites                            Email this article                            Print                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Written by/reviewed by: Arthur Schoenstadt, MD                                                           Last reviewed by: Arthur Schoenstadt, MD                                                                                                                                  Other Articles in This eMedTV Presentation                                                                                                                                          Heart Attack                                            Causes of Heart Attack                                            Heart Attack and Smoking                                            Cholesterol and Heart Attack                                            Heart Attack Warning Signs                                             Early Heart Attack Symptoms                                            Heart Attack Symptoms                                            Heartburn or Heart Attack?

About half (515,000) of these people die as a result. About half of those who die do so within one hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital.       A heart attack is a very frightening event. But if you learn the warning signs and know what steps to take, you can save a life -- maybe your own.       So what are heart attack warning signs? Many people think a heart attack is sudden and intense, like a ""movie"" heart attack, where a person clutches his or her chest and falls over. Sometimes, this is the case. However, for a lot of people, heart attacks start slowly, as a mild pain or discomfort. If you feel such a symptom, you may not be sure what's wrong. Your symptoms may even come and go. Even those individuals who have had a heart attack may not recognize their symptoms, because the next attack can have entirely different ones.         Common Warning Signs of a Heart Attack                                                                                                                                                                                                          Common signs of a heart attack include:               Chest discomfort        Pain that spreads to one or both arms, back, jaw, or stomach        Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air)        Cold sweats and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach).                  Chest Discomfort   Heart attacks often involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. But pain is not always a heart attack warning sign. In fact, in up to 20 percent of heart attacks, a person has no pain. Also, for a lot of people, chest pain from a heart attack may feel like indigestion or  heartburn   (see  Heartburn or Heart Attack? ) .

Fibromyalgia literally means pain in the muscles, ligaments, and tendons.   Fibromyalgia is considered a syndrome because it is a set of signs and symptoms occurring together. It is not considered a type of arthritis, but definitely is a form of soft-tissue rheumatism (conditions which cause pain and stiffness around joints, as well as in muscles and bone). There is no  inflammation  associated with fibromyalgia. Cause of Fibromyalgia:  The cause of fibromyalgia remains unknown. Researchers have suggested that fibromyalgia patients experience pain amplification caused by abnormal sensory processing in the central nervous system. Other research has determined that some fibomyalgia patients have:   Increased level of substance P (a chemical which increases nerve sensitivity to pain) in the spinal cord   Decreased blood flow to the  thalamus  region of the brain   Imbalance of hormones in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (affecting how the patient copes with stress)   Low levels of  serotonin  and  tryptophan   Abnormal  cytokine function Symptoms Associated With Fibromyalgia:  Other than the primary symptom associated with fibromyalgia -- widespread muscular pain -- there are other symptoms which are linked to the syndrome. The symptoms can come and go and vary in intensity:   Severe fatigue   Headaches   Irritable bowel syndrome   Irritable bladder   Cognitive and memory problems   TMJ or temporomandibular joint disorder   Restless leg syndrome   Pelvic pain   Noise and temperature sensitivity   Anxiety or  depression   Skin color changes Diagnosis of Fibromyalgia:  No single test can diagnose fibromyalgia. Laboratory tests are ordered to rule out other conditions. X-rays do not reveal evidence of fibromyalgia.   In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology established criteria to be used for diagnosing fibromyalgia:    A history of widespread pain in all four quadrants of the body (e.g. above the waist on both sides; below the waist on both sides of the body) for three months or more.   Pain at 11 of 18  tender point  sites   According to the National Fibromyalgia Association, it has been estimated that it takes five years on average to get an accurate diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Treatment of Fibromyalgia:  Pain management is a primary area of focus for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Pain can be relieved by using pain medications like  acetaminophen  or  NSAIDs  (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).  Tramadol (Ultram)   is another pain reliever prescribed by doctors to treat fibromyalgia pain. Certain anti-depressants or benzodiazepines can also be prescribed to help with sleep and pain. Local injections into tender points may also be helpful.   Lifestyle modifications including regular  exercise ,  good sleep habits , emotional support, and  complementary treatments  help manage fibromyalgia symptoms. Prevalence of Fibromyalgia:  According to the National Fibromyalgia Association, about 5 to 7 percent of Americans are affected by fibromyalgia. Women are the predominantly affected gender, although men and children also can have fibromyalgia. All races are affected by the condition. Points of Interest About Fibromyalgia:  Overlapping symptoms with other rheumatic conditions makes diagnosing fibromyalgia difficult.   People who already have a rheumatic disease such as  lupus ,  rheumatoid arthritis , or  ankylosing spondylitis  are at greater risk for developing fibromyalgia.   Activity level, time of day, weather patterns, sleep patterns, and stress can all affect fibromyalgia pain and other symptoms. Being aware of certain patterns may help you manage fibromyalgia.   Fatigue or sleep disturbance occurs in 90 percent of fibromyalgia patients.   More research is ongoing to study the role of genetics, environmental stress, and physical trauma.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5 :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

I have hundreds of fatty tumors all over my body. Each year I get more and the old ones keep growing. They look so bad. Where do they come from and what can I do?                                              A                                               Answer (Published 1/12/2009)                                           The fatty tumors you describe are called lipomas. They tend to be small, less than an inch in diameter, but some can grow to the size of an egg or even larger. They develop under the skin and are soft, round and move around when you touch them. Lipomas commonly occur on the chest, back, shoulders, neck, upper arms and thighs, and while they tend to grow slowly, if one develops, chances are that others will appear. No one knows why these lumps form, although they do tend to run in families and may result from mutations in fat cells leading to rapid, but orderly proliferation. They are benign growths, meaning they do not become cancerous and do not metastasize (spread to other organs). Sometimes lipomas are first noticed after an injury, but it isn't clear whether they're caused by trauma or just discovered coincidentally. A doctor usually can make a diagnosis by feeling the lump. These growths are fairly common, affecting about one in every 1,000 people, usually those in their 40s, 50s and 60s, although they're not unusual among younger people. Women seem more prone to them than men.

If you have lipomas, you know that they usually are not painful, although they can be uncomfortable if they develop under sensitive areas of the body. I'm afraid there's no proven remedy you can use to prevent new lipomas from developing, although you might try hypnosis to see if that helps. If they're painful or if you're self-conscious about yours, you can always have them removed surgically. Since they present no threat to health, they require no treatment if they don't bother you. advertisement <script language=JavaScript src=""http://rotator.adjuggler.com/servlet/ajrotator/235936/0/vj?z=weil&dim=235960&pos=3&abr=$scriptiniframe""></script><noscript><a href=""http://rotator.adjuggler.com/servlet/ajrotator/235936/0/cc?z=weil&pos=3""><img src=""http://rotator.adjuggler.com/servlet/ajrotator/235936/0/vc?z=weil&dim=235960&pos=3&abr=$imginiframe"" width=""300"" height=""250"" border=""0""></a></noscript> The surgery is a simple procedure done under local anesthetic. You can also have steroid injections that can shrink lipomas but don't eliminate them. Dermatologists also remove lipomas with liposuction, but it's difficult to get rid of the entire growth by this method. The biggest disadvantage to surgery is that it is considered a cosmetic, not a medical, procedure so it usually isn't covered by health insurance. Other disadvantages include scarring as well as the possibility that lipomas will recur after surgery. If your lipomas are on visible parts of your body, and you are thinking about having them removed, I suggest consulting a plastic surgeon. Andrew Weil, M.D.                   Do you have lipomas?

What outcomes are linked to hip fractures?    Who is at risk?    How can hip fractures be prevented?         How big is the problem?        In 2004, there were more than 320,000 hospital admissions for hip fractures, a 3% increase from the previous year. However, from 1996 to 2004, after adjusting for the increasing age of the U.S. population, the hip fracture rate decreased 25% (from 1,060 per 100,000 population to 850 per 100,000 population). 4   Over 90% of hip fractures are caused by falling 5, most often by falling sideways onto the hip. 6              In 1990, researchers estimated that the number of hip fractures would exceed 500,000 by the year 2040. 7             What outcomes are linked to hip fractures?          About one out of five hip fracture patients dies within a year of their injury. 8         Most patients with hip fractures are hospitalized for about one week. 9         Up to one in four adults who lived independently before their hip fracture has to stay in a nursing home for at least a year after their injury. 10         In 1991, Medicare costs for hip fractures were estimated to be $2.9 billion. 11       Who is at risk?              About 76% of all hip fractures occur in women. 4         Hip fracture rates increase exponentially with age among men and women. 12  People 85 and older are 10 to 15 times more likely to sustain hip fractures than are people ages 60 to 65. 13         Osteoporosis increases a person likelihood of sustaining a hip fracture. 14           How can hip   fractures be prevented?     Hip fractures can be prevented by preventing falls. Fall prevention strategies include:          Exercising regularly; To reduce risk of injury from falls, older adults with substantial risk should perform exercises that maintain or improve balance. 15  Tai Chi exercises that increase strength and balance are especially good. 16         Having medicines reviewedoth prescription and over-the countero reduce side effects and interactions.         Having yearly eye exams.       Reducing fall hazards in the home.           The most effective way to prevent fall-related injuries, including hip fractures, is to combine exercise with other fall prevention strategies. 17       References     1 Grisso JA, Kelsey JL, Strom BL, Chiu GY, Maislin G, O'Brien LA, et al.

It is a symptom of many conditions, but most often is associated with colds or  influenza . Sore throat may be caused by either viral or bacterial infections or environmental conditions. Most sore throats heal without complications, but they should not be ignored because some develop into serious illnesses. Description Almost everyone gets a sore throat at one time or another, although children in child care or grade school have them more often than adolescents and adults. Sore throats are most common during the winter months when upper respiratory infections (colds) are more frequent. Sore throats can be either acute or chronic. Acute sore throats are the more common. They appear suddenly and last from three to about seven days. A chronic sore throat lasts much longer and is a symptom of an unresolved underlying condition or disease, such as a sinus infection.    — Tish Davidson                              Answers.com ▼    Home Page   Browse   Personalize   Print page   Email page   Translate page       WikiAnswers.com ▼    Home Page   Browse   Recent questions       Advanced search   Help                       Search unanswered questions...

It is a symptom of many conditions, but most often is associated with colds or  influenza . Sore throat may be caused by either viral or  bacterial   infections  or by environmental conditions. Most sore throats heal without complications, but they should not be ignored because some develop into serious illnesses. Description Almost everyone gets a sore throat at one time or another, although children in child care or grade school have them more often than adolescents and adults. Sore throats are most common during the winter months when upper respiratory infections (colds) and influenza are more frequent. Sore throats can be either acute or chronic. Acute sore throats are the more common. They may appear suddenly and last approximately three to about seven days. A chronic sore throat that is still present after three weeks may be a symptom of an unresolved underlying condition or disease, such as a  sinus infection  or  mononucleosis . Causes & Symptoms Sore throats have many different causes, and may or may not be accompanied by cold symptoms,  fever , or swollen lymph glands. Proper treatment depends on identifying the cause. Viral Sore Throat Viruses cause 9095% of all sore throats. Cold and flu viruses are the main culprits. These viruses cause an inflammation in the throat and occasionally the tonsils ( tonsillitis ). Cold symptoms usually accompany a viral sore throat. These can include a runny nose,  cough , congestion, hoarseness,  conjunctivitis , fever, and swollen  lymph nodes  in the neck. The level of throat  pain  varies from uncomfortable to excruciating, when it is painful for the patient to eat, breathe, swallow, or speak. Another group of viruses that cause sore throat are the adenoviruses. These may also cause infections of the lungs and ears. In addition to a sore throat, symptoms that accompany an adenovirus infection may include cough, runny nose, white bumps on the tonsils and throat, mild diarrhea, vomiting, and a rash. The sore throat lasts about one week. A third type of virus that can cause severe sore throat is the coxsackie virus. It can cause a disease called herpangina. Although anyone can get herpangina, it is most common in children up to age 10 and is more prevalent in the summer or early autumn. Herpangina is sometimes called summer sore throat. Three to six days after being exposed to the virus, an infected person develops a sudden sore throat that is usually accompanied by a fever usually between 102104F (38.940C). Tiny grayish-white  blisters  form on the throat and in the mouth. These fester and become small ulcers. Throat pain is often severe, interfering with swallowing. Children may easily become dehydrated if they are reluctant to eat or drink because of the pain. In addition, people with herpangina may vomit, have abdominal pain, and generally feel ill and miserable. Another common cause of a viral sore throat is mononucleosis. Mononucleosis occurs when the  Epstein-Barr virus  infects one specific type of  lymphocyte . The infection may spread to the  lymphatic  system, respiratory system, liver,  spleen , and throat. Symptoms appear 3050 days after exposure. Mononucleosis, sometimes called the kissing disease, is extremely common in young adults. It is estimated that by the age of 3540, 8095% of Americans will have had mononucleosis. Often, symptoms are mild, especially in young children, and are diagnosed as a cold. Since symptoms are more severe in adolescents and adults, more cases are diagnosed as mononucleosis in this age group. One of the main symptoms of mononucleosis is a severe sore throat. Although a runny nose and cough are much more likely to accompany a sore throat caused by a virus than one caused by a bacteria, there is no absolute way to tell what is causing the sore throat without a laboratory test. Viral sore throats are contagious and are passed directly from person to person by coughing and  sneezing . Bacterial Sore Throat From 510% of sore throats are caused by bacteria. The most common bacterial sore throat results from an infection by group A  Streptococcus . This type of infection is commonly called  strep throat , or GABHS pharyngitis. The acronym stands for ""Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci."" Anyone can get strep throat, but it is most common in school age children. Since three is a low risk of strep throat invading and damaging heart valves ( rheumatic fever ), it is important to see a doctor who may prescribe antibiotics to eliminate the risk. Pharyngeal  gonorrhea , a sexually transmitted bacterial disease, causes a severe sore throat. Gonorrhea in the throat is transmitted by having oral sex with an infected person. Noninfectious Sore Throat Not all sore throats are caused by infection. Post-nasal drip from  allergies  and airborne irritants can cause sore throat. It can be caused by  hay fever  and other allergies that irritate the sinuses. Environmental and other conditions, such as heavy  smoking  or breathing secondhand smoke, breathing polluted air or chemical fumes, or swallowing substances that burn or scratch the throat can also cause pharyngitis. Dry air, like that in airplanes or from forced hot air furnaces, can make the throat sore. People who breathe through their mouths at night because of nasal congestion often get sore throats that improve as the day progresses. Sore throat caused by environmental conditions is not contagious. Diagnosis It is easy for people to tell if they have a sore throat, but difficult to diagnose its cause without seeing a doctor and having laboratory tests. Most sore throats are minor and heal without any complications. A small number of bacterial sore throats develop into serious diseases. It is advisable to see a doctor if a sore throat lasts more than a few days or is accompanied by fever,  nausea , or abdominal pain. Diagnosis of a sore throat by a doctor begins with a physical examination of the throat and chest. The doctor will also look for signs of other illness, such as a sinus infection or  bronchitis . Since both bacterial and viral sore throats are contagious and pass easily from person to person, the doctor will seek information about whether the patient has been around other people with flu, sore throat, colds, or  strep throat . If it appears that the patient may have  strep  throat, the doctor will do laboratory tests. One test that doctors are using more often in diagnosing a sore throat is the rapid antigen test. While a throat culture may require 2 days for the laboratory to identify the  causative  organism, a rapid antigen test gives results in a few hours. If mononucleosis is suspected, the doctor may do a Monospot test to look for antibodies indicating the presence of the  Epstein-Barr  virus. The test in inexpensive, takes only a few minutes, and can be done in a physician's office. An inexpensive blood test can also determine the presence of antibodies to the mononucleosis virus. Treatment Effective treatment varies depending on the cause of the sore throat. As frustrating as it may be to the patient, viral sore throat is best left to run its course without drug treatment. Antibiotics have no effect on a viral sore throat. They do not shorten the length of the illness, nor do they lessen the symptoms. Treatment uses antiviral plants and herbs and vitamins to boost immunity and speed recovery. Aromatherapists recommend inhaling the fragrances of  essential oils  of  lavender  (Lavandula officinalis),  thyme  ( Thymus vulgaris ),  eucalyptus  ( Eycalyptus globulus ),  sage  ( Salvia officinalis ), and  sandalwood . Ayurvedic  practitioners suggest gargling with a mixture of water, salt, and  turmeric  ( Curcuma longa ) powder or astringents such as  alum ,  sumac , sage, and  bayberry  ( Myrica  spp.). Herbalists recommend taking  osha  root ( Ligusticum porteri ) internally for infection, or drinking  ginger  ( Zingiber officinale ) or  slippery elm  ( Ulmus fulva ) tea for pain. Homeopaths may treat sore throats with superdilute solutions of  Lachesis, Belladonna , or  Phytolacca , yellow jasmine ( Gelsemium ), or mercury  (Mercurius). Nutritional recommendations include  zinc  lozenges every two hours along with  vitamin C  with bioflavonoids, vitamin A, and  beta-carotene  supplements. In the case of chronic sore throat, it is necessary to treat the underlying disease to heal the sore throat. If a sore throat is caused by environmental factors, the aggravating stimulus should be eliminated from the sufferer's environment. In the case of chronic sore throat in a child, the doctor may recommend a  tonsillectomy  (surgical removal of the tonsils). Home Care for Sore Throat Regardless of the cause of a sore throat, there are some home care steps that people can take to ease their discomfort. These include: Gargling with warm double strength tea or warm salt water made by adding one teaspoon of salt to 8 oz of water. Drinking plenty of fluids, but avoiding acid juices like orange juice, which can irritate the throat. Sucking on popsicles is a good way to get fluids into children. Eating soft, nutritious foods like noodle soup and avoiding spicy foods. Refraining from smoking. Resting until the fever is gone, then resuming strenuous activities gradually. A room humidifier may make sore throat sufferers more comfortable. Antiseptic lozenges and sprays may aggravate the sore throat rather than improve it. Allopathic Treatment Sore throat caused by a  streptococci  or another bacteria must be treated with antibiotics. Penicillin is the preferred medication. Oral penicillin must be taken for 10 days. Patients need to take the entire amount of antibiotic prescribed, even after symptoms of the sore throat improve. Stopping the antibiotic early can lead to a return of the sore throat. Sometimes a single injection of long-acting penicillin G is given instead of 10 days of oral treatment. These medications generally cost under $15. Because mononucleosis is caused by a virus, there is no specific drug treatment available. Rest, a healthy diet, plenty of fluids, limiting heavy  exercise  and competitive sports, and treatment of aches with acetaminophen ( Datril , Tylenol, Panadol) or ibuprofen ( Advil , Nuprin, Motrin, Medipren) are the prescribed treatments. Nearly 90% of mononucleosis infections are mild. The infected person does not normally get the disease again. Aspirin should not be given to children because of its association with increased risk for Reye's Syndrome, a serious disease. Expected Results Sore throat caused by a viral infection generally clears up on its own within one week with no complications. The exception is mononucleosis. Ninety percent of cases of mononucleosis clear up without medical intervention or complications, so long as dehydration does not occur. In young children the symptoms may last only a week, but in adolescents the symptoms last longer. Adults over age 30 have the most severe and long lasting symptoms. Adults may take up to six months to recover. In all age groups  fatigue  and weakness may continue for up to six weeks after other symptoms disappear. In rare cases of mononucleosis, breathing may be obstructed because of swollen tonsils, adenoids, and lymph glands. If this happens, the patient should immediately seek emergency medical care. Patients with bacterial sore throat begin feeling better about 24 hours after starting antibiotics. Untreated strep throat has the potential to cause  scarlet fever , kidney damage, or rheumatic fever. Scarlet fever causes a rash, and can cause high fever and convulsions. Rheumatic fever causes inflammation of the heart and damage to the heart valves. Taking antibiotics within the first week of a strep infection will prevent these complications. People with strep throat remain contagious until after they have been taking antibiotics for 24 hours. Prevention There is no way to prevent a sore throat; however, the risk of getting one or passing one on to another person can be minimized by: Washing hands with warm water and soap frequently. Maintaining a balanced life with adequate sleep,  nutrition , and personal fulfillment. Avoiding close contact with someone who has a sore throat. Not sharing food and eating utensils with anyone. Not smoking. Optimizing the functioning of the immune system by exercising and eating such immune-boosting foods as carrots, yams, shiitake mushrooms, etc. Avoiding sources of air pollution.

Description Sore throat is also called  pharyngitis . It is a symptom of many conditions, but is most often associated with colds or  influenza . Sore throat may be caused by either viral or  bacterial  infections or environmental conditions. Most sore throats heal without complications, but they should not be ignored, as some develop into serious illnesses. Sore throats can be either acute or chronic. Acute sore throats are more common than chronic  sore  throats. They appear suddenly and last from three to about seven days. A chronic sore throat lasts much longer and is a symptom of an  unresolved  underlying condition or disease, such as a  sinus infection . Transmission The way in which a sore throat is transmitted depends on the agent causing the sore throat. Viral and bacterial sore throats are usually passed in the same way as the  common cold : sneezing,  coughing , sharing drinking glasses or  silverware , or in any other way  germ  particles can easily move from one person to another. Some sore throats are caused by environmental factors or  allergies . These sore throats cannot be passed from one person to another. Demographics Almost everyone gets a sore throat at one time or another, although children in child care or grade school have them more often than adolescents and adults. Sore throats are most common during the winter months when upper respiratory infections (colds) are more frequent. About 10 percent of children who go to the doctor each year have pharyngitis. Forty percent of the time that children are taken to the doctor with a sore throat, the sore throat is diagnosed as viral. An antibiotic cannot help to cure a virus; a virus has to be left to run its course. In about 30 percent of the cases for which children are taken to the doctor, bacteria are found to be responsible for the sore throat. Many of these bacterial sore throats are cases of  strep throat . Sore throats caused by bacteria can be successfully treated with  antibiotics . In about 40 percent of these cases of pharyngitis, it is never clear what caused the sore throat. In these cases it is possible that the virus or bacteria was not identified, or that other factors such as environment or post-nasal  drip  may have been responsible. Causes and Symptoms Sore throats have many different causes, and may or may not be accompanied by cold symptoms,  fever , or  swollen  lymph  glands . Proper treatment depends on understanding the cause of the sore throat. Viral Sore Throat Viruses cause most sore throats. Cold and  flu  viruses are the main culprits.

Another group of  viruses  that causes sore throat are the adenoviruses. These may also cause infections of the lungs and ears. In addition to a sore throat, symptoms that accompany an  adenovirus infection  include cough, runny nose, white  bumps  on the tonsils and throat, mild  diarrhea , vomiting, and a  rash . The sore throat lasts about one week. A third type of virus that can cause severe sore throat is the  coxsackie virus . It can cause a disease called  herpangina . Although anyone can get herpangina, it is most common in children up to age 10 and is more prevalent in the summer or early autumn. Herpangina is sometimes called summer sore throat. Three to six days after being exposed to the coxsackie virus, an infected person develops a sudden sore throat that is accompanied by a substantial fever, usually between 102104F (38.940C). Tiny grayish-white blisters form on the throat and in the mouth. These fester and become small ulcers. Throat pain is often severe, interfering with swallowing. Children may become  dehydrated  if they are reluctant to eat or drink because of the pain. In addition, children with herpangina may  vomit , have  abdominal  pain, and generally feel very ill.

This type of infection is commonly called  strep  throat. Anyone can get strep throat, but it is most common in school age children. Noninfectious Sore Throat Not all sore throats are caused by infection. Postnasal drip can  irritate  the throat and make it sore. It can be caused by hay fever and other  allergies  that irritate the sinuses.

Dry air, like that in airplanes or from forced hot air furnaces, can make the throat sore. Children who breathe through their mouths at night because of nasal congestion often get sore throats that improve as the day progresses. Sore throat caused by environmental conditions is not  contagious . When to Call the Doctor If the child has had a sore throat and fever for more than 24 hours, a doctor should be contacted so a strep test can be performed. Identifying and treating strep throat within about a week is vital to preventing  rheumatic fever . If the child has had a sore throat, even without fever, for more than 48 hours, the doctor should be consulted. If the child has trouble swallowing or breathing, or is drooling excessively (in small children), emergency medical attention should be sought immediately. Diagnosis It is easy for people to tell if they have a sore throat, but difficult to know what has caused it without laboratory tests. Most sore throats are minor and heal without any complications. A small number of bacterial sore throats do develop into serious diseases. Because of this, it is advisable to see a doctor if a sore throat lasts more than a few days or is accompanied by fever,  nausea , or abdominal pain.

If it appears that the patient may have strep throat, the doctor will do laboratory tests. If mononucleosis is suspected, the doctor may do a  mono  spot test to look for  antibodies  indicating the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus. The strep test is inexpensive, takes only a few minutes, and can be done in a physician's office. An inexpensive blood test can also determine the presence of antibodies to the mononucleosis virus.

Patients need to take the entire amount of antibiotic prescribed, even after symptoms of the sore throat improve. If it is unlikely that the parent will be able to ensure that the child will take the full course of antibiotics, a one-time injection of antibiotics can be administered instead. Cessation of the antibiotic early can lead to a return of the sore throat. Because a virus causes mononucleosis, there is no specific drug treatment available. Rest, a healthy diet, plenty of fluids, limiting heavy  exercise  and competitive  sports , and treatment of  aches  with  acetaminophen  (Datril, Tylenol, Panadol) or  ibuprofen  (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin, Medipren) will help the illness pass.

What Causes A Sore Throat?    Sore throat is one symptom of an array of different medical disorders. Infections cause the majority of sore throats, and these are the sore throats that are contagious (can be passed from one person to another). Infections are caused by either viruses (such as the ""flu"" the ""common cold"" or mononucleosis) or bacteria (such as ""strep"", mycoplasma or hemophilus).    The most important difference between viruses and bacteria is that bacteria respond well to antibiotic treatment, but viruses do not.      Viruses:   Most viral sore throats accompany the ""flu"" or a ""cold:' When a stuffy-runny nose, sneezing, and generalized aches and pains accompany the sore throat, it is probably caused by one of the hundreds of known viruses. These are highly contagious and cause epidemics in a community, especially in the winter. The body cures itself of a viral infection by building antibodies that destroy the virus, a process that takes about a week.    Sore throats accompany other viral infections such as measles, chicken pox, whooping cough, and croup. Canker sores and fever blisters in the throat also can be very painful.    One special viral infection takes much longer than a week to be cured: infectious mononucleosis or ""mono"" This virus lodges in the lymph system, causing massive enlargement of the tonsils (with white patches on their surface) and swollen glands in the neck, armpits and groin. It creates a severely sore throat, sometimes causes serious difficulties breathing, and can affect the liver, leading to jaundice (yellow skin and eyes). It also causes extreme fatigue that can last six weeks or more.    ""Mono"" is a severe illness in a teenager or young adult, but it is less severe in a child. Since it can be transmitted by saliva, it has been nicknamed the ""kissing disease."" However, it can also be transmitted from mouth-to-hand to hand-to-mouth or by sharing of towels and eating utensils.      Bacteria:   ""Strep throat"" is an infection caused by a particular strain of  streptococcus  bacteria. This infection can also cause damage to the heart valves (rheumatic fever) and kidneys (nephritis). Streptococcal infections can also cause scarlet fever, tonsillitis, pneumonia, sinusitis and ear infections.    Because of these possible complications, a ""strep throat"" should be treated with an antibiotic. ""Strep"" infections usually cause a longer lasting sore throat than a ""cold"" or the ""flu"". But ""strep"" is not always easy to detect by examination, and a throat culture may be needed.    A newly developed ""strep test"" detects a streptococcal infection in about 15 minutes, instead of the 24 hours or more required for a culture to grow. These tests, when positive, influence the physician to prescribe antibiotics. However, strep tests and cultures might not detect a number of other bacteria that can also cause severe sore throats that deserve antibiotic treatment. For example, severe and chronic cases of tonsillitis or tonsillar abscess may be culture negative; similarly, negative cultures are seen with diphtheria, and infections from oral sexual contacts will escape detection with ""strep"" culture tests.    Tonsillitis is an infection of the lumpy tissues on each side of the throat toward the back of the tongue. In the first two to three years of childhood, these tissues ""catch"" infections, sampling the child's environment to help develop his immunities (antibodies). Healthy tonsils  do not remain  infected, however, and frequent sore throats from tonsillitis suggest the infection is not fully eliminated between episodes. A recent study has shown that children who suffer from frequently recurrent episodes of tonsillitis (such as 3 to 4 episodes each year for several years) were healthier after their tonsils were surgically removed.    Infections in the nose and sinuses can also cause sore throats because mucus from the nose drains down into the throat and carries the infection with it.    The most dangerous throat infection is epiglottitis, caused by bacteria that infect a portion of the larynx (voice box) and cause swelling that closes the airway. This infection is an emergency condition that requires prompt medical attention. Suspect it when swallowing is extremely painful (causing drooling), when speech is muffled and when breathing becomes difficult. A ""strep"" culture may miss this infection and be negative.    Allergy:  Hayfever and allergy sufferers can get an irritated throat during an allergy attack the same way they get a stuffy, itchy nose, sneezing and post nasal drip. The same pollens and molds that irritate the  nose  when they are inhaled also may irritate the  throat.  People allergic to cat and dog danders can suffer an irritated throat when they are around such animals. A very common allergy is house dust, and it is a special problem in the winter when a heating system blows dust throughout the house.      Irritation:   During the cold winter months, dry heat may create a recurring, mild sore throat with a parched feeling, especially in the mornings. This often responds to humidification of bedroom air and increased liquid intake. Patients with a chronic stuffy nose, causing mouth breathing, also suffer with a dry throat. They need examination and treatment of the nose.    An occasional cause of morning sore throat is regurgitation of stomach acids up into the back of the throat where they are extremely irritating This can be avoided if you tilt your bedframe so that the head is elevated four to six inches higher than the foot. You should also avoid eating and drinking for one to two hours before retiring. You might find antacids helpful. If these fail, see your doctor.    Industrial pollutants and chemicals in the air can irritate the nose and throat, but by far the most common and pervasive air pollutant is tobacco smoke. It cannot be tolerated by many persons who are either allergic or over sensitive to its contents. Other irritants include smokeless tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods.    A person who strains his voice (yelling at a sports event, for example) gets a sore throat not only from muscle strain, but also from the rough treatment of his throat membranes. Well-trained, experienced public speakers and singers learn not to abuse their throats and voices in this way. They produce loud voices by taking deep breaths and using their chest and abdominal muscles more than their throat muscles.      Tumors:   Tumors of the throat, tongue and larynx (voice box) are usually (but not always) associated with long time use of tobacco and alcohol. Sore throat and difficult swallowing-sometimes with pain radiating to the ear - may be symptoms of such a tumor. More often the sore throat is so mild or so chronic that it is hardly noticed. Other important symptoms include hoarseness, a lump in the neck, unexplained weight loss and/or spitting up blood in the saliva or phlegm.    The diagnosis will require examination by a physician with special training in diseases of the ears, nose, throat, head and neck. Special mirrors or telescopic instruments will be used to see the suspicious areas of the throat.      How Can I Treat My Own Sore Throat?    A mild sore throat associated with ""cold"" or ""flu"" symptoms can be made more comfortable with the following remedies:        Increase your liquid intake. (Warm tea with honey is a favorite home remedy).     Use a steamer or humidifier in your bedroom.     Gargle with warm salt water several times daily:  tsp. salt to 1/2 cup water.     Take mild pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol Datril Tempra,     ibuprofen (Advil, etc.     Take non-prescription throat lozenges.        When Should I See a Doctor?    Whenever a sore throat is severe, persists longer than the usual five to seven day duration of a ""cold"" or ""flu"" and is not associated with an avoidable allergy or irritation, you should seek medical attention. The following signs and symptoms should alert you to see your physician:        Severe and prolonged sore throat     Difficulty breathing     Difficulty swallowing     Difficulty opening the mouth     Joint pains     Earache     Rash     Fever (Over 101     Blood in saliva or phlegm     Frequently recurring sore throat     Lump in the neck     Hoarseness lasting over 2 weeks        When Should I Take Antibiotics?    Antibiotics are drugs that kill or impair bacteria. Penicillin or erythromycin (well-known antibiotics) are prescribed when the physician suspects streptococcal or other bacterial infection that will respond to them. However, a number of bacterial throat infections do not respond to penicillin, but require other categories of antibiotics instead. Antibiotics do not cure viral infections, but viruses do lower the patient's resistance to bacterial infections. When such a combined infection occurs, antibiotics may become necessary.    When an antibiotic is prescribed, it should be taken -as the physician directs- for the full course (usually 10 days). Otherwise the infection will probably be suppressed rather than eliminated, and it can return.      What If My Throat Culture Is Negative?    A ""strep"" culture tests only for the presence of streptococcal infections. Many other infections, both bacterial and viral, will yield negative cultures and sometimes so does a streptococcal infection. Therefore, when your culture is negative, your physician will base his decision for treatment on the severity of your symptoms and the appearance of your throat on examination. Do not discontinue your medications unless your physician instructs you to do so.      Should Other Family Members Be Treated? or Cultured?    When ""strep"" throat is proven by test or culture, many experts recommend treatment of other family members, because streptococcal infections are so highly contagious. Others recommend treating only the family members with sore throats and culturing the others. So be sure you tell your physician how other family members are feeling. Practice good sanitary habits; avoid close physical contact and sharing of napkins, towels and utensils with the infected person. Handwashing makes good sense.    The advice in this pamphlet is for general information. But remember, the best advice for your specific case is what you get from your physician who hears your symptoms and examines your throat.           WHAT IS OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY?    Otolaryngology-head and neck surgery is a specialty concerned with the medical and surgical treatment of the ears, nose, throat and related structures of the head and neck. The specialty encompasses cosmetic facial reconstruction, surgery of benign and malignant tumors of the head and neck, management of patients with loss of hearing and balance, endoscopic examination of air and food passages and treatment of allergic, sinus, laryngeal, thyroid and esophageal disorders.    To qualify for the American Board of Otolaryngology certification examination, a physician must complete five or more years of post-M.D. (or D.O.) specialty training.    993.

RSS         Treating Fibromyalgia or CFS - Who Do You Trust?   Sunday January 27, 2008   When you have a chronic condition that typically starts with confusion, misdiagnosis, conflicting information and skepticism about whether you're really sick, it can become hard to know who to trust.  Doctors have let you down.  Some research seems more based on money and politics than on sound science.  Drug companies and others offering treatments charge you a fortune and you may not see any result.  Even worse, you may develop a ton of side effects.  Internet claims of ""cures"" abound.  Some researchers offer treatment protocols that are unproven by clinical trials.   When searching for information - especially on treatments - we constantly have to wonder whether this guy we just discovered online really does know something your doctor does not.  It's hard not to be so desperate for relief that you're willing to try anything, no matter the cost.  We don't want to be taken advantage of, lied to, and come out feeling foolish and broke as a result.  Then again, there's that ""what if"" in your mind - what if THIS one really would help?   Personally, I disregard anyone offering a cure, and I'm skeptical of anyone offering high-priced treatments you can get only through them.  I'm cautiously optimistic toward researchers who put forth experimental protocols (if the science behind them seems credible).  I consider drug trials important in the path to understanding what's going on in our bodies, but I'd sure like to see more money put into low-cost, low-side effect or natural treatments.  I put the most faith in scientific studies, but then I have to remind myself that money, politics and specific agendas come into play, sadly, even there.   On your quest for better treatments, who do you trust?  What do you look for?  Have you learned any hard lessons or found something that works for you?  Let us know.

He uses common sense.       February 1, 2008 at 6:02 pm (2)   john duke  says:    If something looks like an elephant and walkes like an elephant it meost likely is an elephant.I believe cfs is a latent viral illness similar to chicken pox(later shingles)which for some reason becomes active.Of course there is no money in curing any disease or syndrome so there is very little political will to fund any serious investgation into the cause.       February 2, 2008 at 11:40 pm (3)   Katherine  says:    After 30 doctors I stopped counting! I could save someone a lot of trouble if they are going to an orthopedic surgeon, chiropractor and possibly a physical therapist, infectologist and neurologist and NOT getting results. If you are improving, keep going, but they haven’t helped me except to rule out surgery and other diseases. What has helped is talk therapy, diet, vitamins, supplements and other lifestyle changes to limit physical and emotional stress. I have a doctor that I have been seeing regularly for the last year who is an internist and oversees my treatment in his integrated medicine practice. I am still hoping to break the code to get good sleep, get my energy back and stop my muscles from knotting up.  Now I am trying synthiod for energy even though I have normal thyroid levels. I finally decided to have my husband sleep on a daybed in our living room. I am hoping to sleep better and get up at the right time. If I still can’t then I might go to a sleep institute. I haven’t been successful eliminating my trigger points through exercise, massage or stretching. According to my doc, I have to take a ball and knead them out. I have tried this twice and didn’t stick with it because it hurts so badly. My doctor told me I have to do it, so I will once I get the will power. Also, I’ve heard that trazodone works for some with FMS, but I haven’t tried it yet. Has anyone had any results with it? Thanks for the great topic.

If you are improving, keep going, but they haven’t helped me except to rule out surgery and other diseases. What has helped in my case is talk therapy, low dose muscle relaxers, acid reducers, diet, vitamins, supplements and other lifestyle changes to limit physical and emotional stress. I haven been helped in these areas by practioners in the US and Mexico who are psychologists, rheumatologists, internists, and alternative medicine practioners.

February 4, 2008 at 12:28 am (5)   Linda  says:    In answer to Katherine’s question about Trazadone.  Yes, I have tried it with no results.  Tizanidine and Gabapentin seems to alleviate some of my symptoms. However, I hope to someday try life with NO DRUGS and just improve my lifestyle and stress levels and to alleviate my fibro and CFS to a more manageable level.  But for now, my quality of life needed improvement right away.  Everyone needs to find that potion to get them by.  But, I feel the need to try to get to the root of the problem and fix it!  Meds are fine, but only seem to be temporary!       February 4, 2008 at 3:46 am (6)   THEA SCHLOSSER  says:    I HAVE BOTH CFIDS -FMS .  I DO THINK THAT THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ILLNESSES .

WHEN I WROTE THE BOOK ,BEYOND THE DARK CLOUD ,SHARED MY LIFE AND HOPED I COULD HELP OTHERS ,I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH AND RECIEVED A LOT OF EMAIL FROM AROUND THE WORLD .  IT CAME CLEAR TO ME EVERY DAY WITH OUT DOUGHT ,THAT CFIDS IS A VIRUS IMMUNEDYSORDER ,FIBROMYALGIA,NOT COUSED BY A VIRUS BUT A MALFUNCTION OF THE CENTAL NERVOES SYSTEM .  I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU AND BEING A IMMEGRANT ,MY ENGLISH IS TO TO BE DESIRED .  LOOKING EVERY WORD I WRITE UP ,DONTH HAVE THE ENERGY .   PEACE -LOVE AND COMPASSION       February 4, 2008 at 9:44 pm (7)   sue  says:    Regarding the knots and trigger points-I don’t have the energy to work them out myself–I get massages–there are several different types that take care of specific issues. The massages are a very important part of the ongoing treatment.       February 4, 2008 at 10:06 pm (8)   sue  says:    Regarding your FM AND CF theory–many many folks agree with you that they are not the same disease-although they share some characteristics.  The MAIN symtom of FM is pain and the MAIN symptom of CF is fatigue. It seems the longer you have FM you develop CF due to the path of the syndrome. There is a book you would probably enjoy by Devin Starlynd and Mary Ellen Copeland that goes thru the many theories and treatments of CF and FM. This book is often quoted and as far as I can tell in my 10 year odyssey pretty highly regarded.  I have the first and second editions and they are highlighted and underscorded and marked up on almost every page–I go back to it over and over as symptoms come and go.  And I think you did a great job of typing in english!  Sue       February 8, 2008 at 2:31 pm (9)   Katherine  says:    Thank you all for your input. The more info we can share the better we can get at overcoming this illness.       February 8, 2008 at 2:40 pm (10)   Katherine  says:    My update is the synthyroid is not going to be a cure for me. Thanks for the other tips on other meds to try.   One good thing is that I think sleeping by myself is allowing me to get better sleep. I am still waking up with pain, but at least not  from my husband.    Also, I ventured out to get a massage again and I was a wreck yesterday. I really want to overcome this trigger point issue. I would really appreciate it if Sue and others could comment on what specific massage techniques have worked. It seems there is such a fine line between therapeutic massages and real healing. I really want to get the healing!       February 8, 2008 at 3:07 pm (11)   Adrienne  says:    Katherine,   I haven’t had massage therapy, although I’m considering it for my myofascial pain syndrome.  I’ve had great luck with acupuncture, though, and highly recommend for reducing pain.   You might have luck asking your questions about massage in the  forum  here.       December 5, 2008 at 4:55 pm (12)   Nissa  says:    After a ectopic pregnancy that resulted in a spontaneous abortion & a severe infection that followed in Sept 2008 & after seeing countless doctors over the course of the past 20 years, scanned head to toe, & being told that my symptoms were in my head (being cold all the time, numbness in hands & feet, pain/tender points, dizziness, irritable bowel, irregular heartbeat, painful lumps in tendons, etc.), I was recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I think this is an auto-immune disease, which is a by-product of a virus. I’m not sure if it’s related to chicken pox (had), shingles (had), Lymes Disease (don know but been bit by lots of tics), the flu (had), Epstein Bar (not sure), or a specific strain of HPV (not sure), which we all know now causes cervical cancer in women but who knows if it causes prostate cancer in men or other diseases later in life.    I personally resent public opinion and the health community’s including my own Rheumatologist stance that this is purely psychological/stress related syndrome & not a true disease. OK, I’ll admit I thought just crazy chicks had it until I was diagnosed. You don’t hear the medical community saying Herpes is caused by stress, but stress does trigger outbreaks. I believe trauma, illness, &/or stress weakens the immune system & provides the opportunity for Fibromyalgia to rear its ugly head time & time again. Since Fibromyalgia is so illusive & it doesn’t appear to kill you like AIDS, no one has put two-&-two together about what truly caused the illness. I think that since the virus impacts the central nervous system, people who have Fibromyalgia may not always be firing on all cylinders & may behave crazy. I don’t think we have an abnormal pain perception. I think our brains are perceiving the true pain we’re in & that’s why we have a high level of Substance-P. I’m sore. You press on me, which causes more pain, & my brain & body respond accordingly.    In April 1988, I got sick with an illness that made me unable to hold anything down for several weeks without vomiting & I had severe bronchitis as well. It came on VERY suddenly like the flu, & the doctor then told me I had two different viruses. I nearly died. By that June, I started experiencing severe joint pain, painful lumps throughout my body (lymph nodes), severe hair loss in clumps, numbness & tingling in my extremities that went on for many years before evolving to the Fibromyalgia symptoms I have today.    Just think about the Canadian TV show that Michael J Fox was on before Family Ties. No one would have known that one form of Parkinson’s Disease was caused by a virus if half the cast had not had the same virus in the late 70’s & all came down with the same form of Parkinson’s many years later. Who’s to say that the perception that Fibromyalgia is genetic could be attributed to families sharing cooties. My sister, mother, and grandmother all have the same symptoms, but we all had the strange illness in the 80s that made us have the severe joint pain & hair loss too? Who to say that it can be spread during pregnancy too to our children like AIDS?       December 8, 2008 at 4:17 pm (13)   Amanda  says:    I just wanted to comment on the Trigger Point issue.  I cannot/ am not giving medical advice, but I was a clinical massage therapist who did alot of Trigger Point therapy (and taught it) before coming down with CFS/Fibro myself.  I have a few personal observations to share.   1) Fibro “Trigger Points” are not, in my experience, the same thing as the “Trigger Points” that massage therapists and PTs target with the Trigger Point therapy protocol.  They are completely different things.  Trigger Point protocol works quite well on “regular” Trigger Points, but doesn’t address the so-called “Trigger Points” of fibro.  This is a very serious terminology problem.  Fibro patients can certainly ALSO have “regular” Trigger Points (just like we can ALSO have a cold or a broken leg,) but Fibro Tender/Trigger Points are not what Trigger Point Therapy is designed (or able) to treat.  The pain is caused by different things.   2) MDs rarely understand anything substantive about hands on therapies like massage, and it seems likely to me that your dr who keeps telling you to do Trigger POint therapy doesn’t understand how it actually works.  You might read about it and then ask him some questions to test this.  He should be able to explain to you in detail HOW Trigger Point therapy works, WHAT the protocol is, and WHY he thinks it has anything to do with Fibro, if he’s so confident about it.   3) Massage therapists rarely understand enough about Fibro to really perceive this difference, either. They don’t understand the etiology of Fibro muscle pain versus “normal” muscle pain.  They will use every tool they know that work for regular muscle pain, and often not “get” that they are dealing with something very different.   Massage can help with normal aches and pains, and it can (if used correctly) even help MANAGE fibro pain.  But it can’t get rid of your Fibro-based Trigger Points, in my opinion.   That is my opinion.       December 9, 2008 at 4:32 pm (14)   chronicfatigue  says:    Very good point - thanks for bringing this up!   The use of the term “trigger points” in fibromyalgia makes me crazy.  I also have myofascial pain syndrome, so I know the very real difference between true trigger points and what’s properly referred to as fibromyalgia “tender points.”  If I tried to massage my tender points like I do trigger points, it would have me wracked with pain for days!     I think there’s a lot of confusion and misunderstanding about the difference between fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome, especially since so many of us have both.       December 21, 2008 at 4:28 am (15)   lynn  says:    As a victim of Fybromyalgia;I totally agree with #12; I believe that Fibromyalgia is the disease with virus involve in.

Among the 515 women studied, 95-percent said they knew their symptoms were new or different a month or more before experiencing their heart attack, or Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). The symptoms most commonly reported were unusual fatigue (70.6-percent), sleep disturbance (47.8-percent), and shortness of breath (42.1-percent).   Many women never had chest pains  Surprisingly, fewer than 30% reported having chest pain or discomfort prior to their heart attacks, and 43% reported have no chest pain during any phase of the attack. Most doctors, however, continue to consider chest pain as the most important heart attack symptom in both women and men.  The NIH study, titled  ""Women's Early Warning Symptoms of AMI,""  is one of the first to investigate women's experience with heart attacks, and how this experience differs from men's. Recognition of symptoms that provide an early indication of heart attack, either imminently or in the near future, is critical to forestalling or preventing the disease.  In a NIH press release, Jean McSweeney, PhD, RN, Principal Investigator of the study at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, said, ""Symptoms such as indigestion, sleep disturbances, or weakness in the arms, which many of us experience on a daily basis, were recognized by many women in the study as warning signals for AMI. Because there was considerable variability in the frequency and severity of symptoms,"" she added, ""we need to know at what point these symptoms help us predict a cardiac event.""   Women's symptoms not as predictable  According to Patricia A.Grady, PhD, RN, Director of the NINR, ""Increasingly, it is evident that women's symptoms are not as predictable as men's. This study offers hope that both women and clinicians will realize the wide range of symptoms that can indicate heart attack. It is important not to miss the earliest possible opportunity to prevent or ease AMI, which is the number one cause of death in both women and men.""   The women's major symptoms prior to their heart attack included:[/br]   Unusual fatigue - 70%   Sleep disturbance - 48%   Shortness of breath - 42%   Indigestion - 39%   Anxiety - 35%   Major symptoms during the heart attack include:   Shortness of breath - 58%   Weakness - 55%   Unusual fatigue - 43%   Cold sweat - 39%   Dizziness - 39%  Related NIH research into heart attacks in women includes possible ethnic and racial differences.

A study published in the  Annals of Rheumatic Disease  found that male smokers have more pain and cartilage loss than men who do not smoke. Previous studies have not found such a link. Smoking greatly increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration. An Australian study reports that smokers are four times more likely to develop the eye condition than those who have never smoked. Smokers also developed the condition at an earlier age. Analysis of several studies suggests that smoking cigarettes and, in some cases, cigars or pipes, may reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease. However, smoking causes many other serious health conditions and should not be considered a means for preventing Parkinson's. A small study suggests that infants who are breastfed just after their mother smokes sleep less than those whose mothers did not smoke. Smoking Cessation Certain genes may make it easier for you to quit smoking. Researchers at Duke University have identified more than 200 genes that distinguish those who have successfully kicked the habit. It is the first time such genes have been identified. The findings could lead to new smoking cessation therapies that target a person's specific genetic makeup. Smoke Free Zones More and more households in the United States are banning smoking. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 75% of households now forbid smoking at any time or place in the home. Smoking in the Movies Teens who see actors smoke on screen are more likely to become established smokers, according to an updated study in the  Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine . Study authors say the likelihood of smoking increases with exposure to movies that depict such behavior. Introduction More than 20% of adults in the United States smoke, according to a 2006 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than 80% of them smoke every day. Although smoking had steadily declined among adults in recent years, the trend now appears to have stalled. Between 2004 and 2005, the CDC says there was no observable change in smoking rates among U.S. adults. The addictive effects of tobacco have been well documented. Tobacco is considered to be a mood and behavior altering substance that is psychoactive and abusable. Tobacco is believed to be as potentially addictive as alcohol, cocaine, and morphine. Tobacco and its various components increase the risk of cancer (especially in the lung, mouth, larynx, esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, and cervix), heart attacks, strokes, and chronic lung disease. Smoking in Childhood and Adolescence The younger children start smoking, the more likely they will smoke as an adult. Smoking is often immediately addictive. According to the American Cancer Society, the earlier you start smoking, the more likely you are to develop long-term nicotine addiction. In the past, advertising was responsible for encouraging some teens to smoke. New regulations have made it much more difficult for advertisers to promote smoking to young people. However, scenes that show people smoking are still common in movies and television shows, often in a positive light. This may be a major influence on the attitude toward smoking in children and adolescents. An updated study in the  Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine  found that adolescents that watch movies that portray smoking are more likely to become established smokers. To prevent children from smoking, parents should not smoke, and they should tell their child that they disapprove of smoking. Schoolchildren who believed that both their parents strongly disapproved of smoking were less than half as likely to smoke as those kids whose parents did not show as much disapproval towards smoking. Other research has supported these findings. Children whose parents closely monitor their television and music-listening habits are less likely to drink, use drugs, and smoke cigarettes. Neglected children, or children with absentee parents, were four times as likely to abuse drugs, drink, and smoke as children living with parents who were regularly present and who offered a structured lifestyle. In a 2002 study, children who regularly attended religious services were also less likely to smoke. Doctors can have a major effect on young people. However, in one survey, less than half of teenagers had ever been asked by their doctors if they smoked or were counseled not to smoke, even though most teen smokers said they would admit to it if asked. Gender, Age, and Ethnicity More American men smoke than women. The following chart details the rate of current smoking in the United States among adults aged 18 years and over, grouped by age and sex: Age Total Men Women 18 - 44 years 24.1% 27.1% 21.2% 45 - 64 years 21.9% 25.2% 18.8% 65 years and older 8.6% 8.9% 8.3% Source: CDC/National Health Interview Survey 2005 While the number of adults over 65 who smoke is lower than those in other age groups, older adults usually have smoked for a long time (about 40 years) and tend to be heavier smokers, according to the American Lung Association. Because of this, older smokers are more likely to have smoking-related illnesses. Caucasian students (under age 18) are more likely to smoke than Hispanics and African-Americans. In 2005, the rate of smoking was highest among American Indians and Alaskan natives. Hispanics and Asians had the lowest rates. Geography In general, the rate of smoking is highest in the Midwest and South and lowest in the Northeast and West. Utah has the lowest rate of smoking in the United States. Educational Level A major U.S. government study reported that people who have not graduated from high school or received their General Education Development (GED) certificate tend to have higher smoking rates than those who attended college. Higher rates of cigarette smoking have been reported among adults who have earned a GED and those with a 9  11 grade education. The lowest rates are seen among those with advanced college degrees. Psychologic Factors People with low self-esteem and adolescents with behavioral problems have a higher risk for smoking. Men and women with mental disorders are 50% more likely to smoke than those without such illness. For example, depression and schizophrenia are known risk factors for smoking. Both may actually have biologic effects that are responsible for this higher risk. Smoking Among Persons with Disabilities Smoking is much more common among persons with disabilities than those without emotional, mental, or physical limitations. A 2007 Centers for Disease Control study found that the rate of smoking is nearly 50% higher among persons with disabilities. The CDC survey included those with mental illness and drug and alcohol addictions in the disabled group. Genetic Factors Evidence now strongly supports the idea that genes play a role in a person's dependence on nicotine. Researchers are now targeting specific genes that may be responsible for nicotine dependence. So far, research has been shown that there is a common genetic vulnerability to both nicotine and alcohol dependence. Economic Factors Some studies suggest that the cheaper it is to buy cigarettes and smoke, the more widespread smoking will be. For example, states that have low taxes on cigarettes have a high proportion of smokers. Making it more expensive to smoke may reduce the number of smokers. Nicotine Addiction Nicotine is the chemical in cigarettes that makes them addictive. Higher levels of nicotine in a cigarette can make it harder to quit smoking. A report by the Massachusetts Department of Health found that the amount of nicotine in cigarettes has steadily increased over the last 6 years. Higher nicotine levels were found in all cigarette categories, including light"" brands. Massachusetts is one of several states that require tobacco manufacturers to submit yearly reports regarding cigarettes. Some researchers feel nicotine is as addictive as heroin. In fact, nicotine has actions similar to heroin and cocaine, and the chemical affects the same area of the brain. Depending on the amount taken in, nicotine can act as either a stimulant or a sedative. Cigarette smoking has definite immediate positive effects. For example, it can: Boost mood and relieve minor depression Suppress little fits of anger Enhance concentration and short-term memory Produce a modest sense of well-being Most smokers have a special fondness for the first cigarette of the day because of the way brain cells respond to the day's first nicotine rush. Nicotine, particularly taken in the first few cigarettes of the day, increases the activity of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that elicits pleasurable sensations, a feeling similar to achieving a reward. Over the course of a day, however, the nerve cells become desensitized to nicotine. Smoking becomes less pleasurable, and smokers may be likely to increase their intake to get their ""reward."" A smoker develops tolerance to these effects very quickly and requires increasingly higher levels of nicotine. A smoker may ""forget"" their craving for nicotine if a part of the brain called the insula becomes damaged. A 2007 study published in the journal  Science  found that smokers with brain damage to this area were 136 times more likely to forget their addiction to nicotine. The findings may one day lead to new drugs that better help a person quit. Smokeless Tobacco Smokeless tobacco, also called spit tobacco, includes chewing tobacco (dip and chew), tobacco powder (snuff), as well as flavored tobacco lozenges. These products also contain nicotine. There are two forms of spit tobacco. These products allow tobacco to be absorbed by the digestive system or through mucous membranes. Smokeless tobacco contains at least 28 cancer-causing substances. Smokeless tobacco is not a safe substitute for smoking cigarettes or cigars. According to the National Institutes of Health, chewing on an average-size piece of chewing tobacco for 30 minutes can deliver as much nicotine as smoking three cigarettes. Although research is inconsistent, some evidence suggests that smokeless tobacco produces a 50-fold increase in the risk of oral cancer, gingivitis, and tooth loss. Health Risks Smoking -- even just a few cigarettes a day -- has been linked to many serious health risks. Some are listed below. Effects on the Lungs According to the American Lung Association, smoking is directly responsible for about 90% of the deaths due to lung cancer. Smoking is also responsible for the majority of deaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. A study in the July 2006  American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine  showed that smokers with asthma who give up smoking can improve their lung function in as little as 1 week. The small study involved 21 smokers with asthma. Ten of them quit smoking for 10 weeks, while the others continued to smoke. After just a week, lung function test scores in those who stopped smoking improved considerably. In less than 2 months, lung function scores among those who stopped smoking improved by more than 15%. Study authors say their findings show that there is a reversible component to the harmful effects of smoking on the airways in asthma. Cardiovascular Effects All forms of tobacco raise heart attack risk. Smoking, chewing tobacco, and being exposed to secondhand smoke greatly increase the risk of a heart attack. In some cases, the risk of heart problems in people who smoke or are exposed to smoke may be three times greater, according to a study published in the journal  Lancet . However, the study also found that the risk of a heart attack among those who stopped smoking slowly decreased over time. Effects on Male Fertility and Impotence Smoking has a negative affect on a man's sexuality and fertility. Heavy smoking is frequently cited as a contributory factor in impotence because it decreases the amount of blood flowing into the penis. One study noted that among men with high blood pressure, smoking caused a 26-fold increase in impotence. Smoking impairs sperm motility, reduces sperm lifespan, and may cause genetic changes that can affect a man's offspring. One 2002 trial found that men or women who smoke have lower success rates with fertility treatments. An earlier study reported that men who smoke also have lower sex drives and less frequent sex. Effects on Female Infertility, Pregnancy, and Childbirth Studies have linked cigarette smoking to many reproductive problems. Continuing to smoke during pregnancy may also cause health problems in the baby. Negative effects of smoking on female fertility include: Greater risk for infertility. Women at greatest risk for fertility problems are those who smoke one or more packs a day and who started smoking before age 18. Earlier menopause. Women who smoke tend to start menopause at an earlier age than nonsmokers, perhaps because toxins in cigarette smoke damage eggs. Pregnancy complications. Women who smoke have a greater risk for ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage.   Click the icon to see an image of an ectopic pregnancy. Effects on Unborn Child.  Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk for stillbirth, prematurity, and low birth weight in their babies. Women who smoke during pregnancy have lower levels of folate, a B vitamin that is important for preventing birth defects. Children of mothers who smoke during pregnancy may also be at increased risk for obesity and diabetes. Some women have particular genes that may make them especially likely to deliver low birth weight infants if they smoke, although newborns of all female smokers have a greater risk for low weight. The good news is that women who quit before becoming pregnant or even during the first trimester reduce the risk for a low birth weight baby to that of women who never smoked. Women who want to become pregnant should make every attempt to quit and should use smoking cessation aids before they try to conceive. After birth, if new mothers cannot quit, they should at least be sure not to smoke in the same room as their infant. Smoking and Breastfeeding . Smoking right before breastfeeding may interrupt the child's sleep patterns. A small study found that such infants sleep less than other infants, and that their sleep time dropped significantly as levels of nicotine in breast milk increased. Effects on Bones and Joints Smoking has many harmful effects on bones and joints: Smoking can keep new bone from forming. Women who smoke are at high risk for loss of bone density and osteoporosis.   Click the icon to see an image of osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women who smoke have a significantly greater risk for hip fracture than those who do not. Men who smoke may have more severe symptoms of knee arthritis, according to a study published in the  Annals of Rheumatic Disease . Smokers are more apt to develop degenerative disorders and injuries in the spine. Smokers have more trouble recovering from surgeries, including knee or hip replacements. A 2006 study published in the  Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery  suggests that smoking delays tendon-bone healing, which may lead to a slower recovery after rotator cuff repair surgery. Smokers whose jobs involve lifting heavy objects are more likely to develop low back pain than nonsmokers. Smoking may increase the risk of rheumatoid arthritis in some older women. A 2006 study in  Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases  showed that smoking nearly doubled the risk of rheumatoid arthritis in postmenopausal women who did not have the most established genetic risk factor for the disease, a genotype called HLA-DRB1 SE.   Click the icon to see an image of rheumatoid arthritis. Smoking and Diabetes Smoking may increase the risk of developing diabetes. Researchers involved in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) looked at the relationship between smoking and diabetes and found that 25% of smokers who started the trial with normal blood sugar had diabetes 5 years later compared to 14% of nonsmokers. The results were published in  Diabetes Care . A study released in 2006 supports earlier beliefs that smokers have a higher risk of developing glucose intolerance, a condition that precedes diabetes. The study, published in the  British Medical Journal , involved 4,572 people. The findings suggest that chemicals in smoke could affect the pancreas. The pancreas is the organ that produces insulin, which helps control blood sugar (glucose) levels. Smoking and the Gastrointestinal Tract Smoking increases acid production in the stomach. It also reduces blood flow and production of compounds that protect the stomach lining. Diverticulitis.  One study suggested that smoking was a major risk factor in diverticulitis, a condition in which small bumps develop in the wall of the colon. In addition, smokers were at risk for complications from diverticulitis, including bleeding and abscess. Diverticulitis mostly affects people over age 50. Inflammatory Bowel Disease.  Smoking has mixed effects on inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is the collective term for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Smokers have been shown to have lower than average rates of ulcerative colitis, but higher than average rates of Crohn's disease. Smokers with Crohn's disease who quit are said to have less severe symptoms.   Click the icon to see an image of inflammatory bowel disease. Peptic Ulcers.  Results of studies on the effect of smoking on ulcers are mixed. Some evidence suggests that smoking delays the healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers. One study reported that after ulcers healed, about half of smokers relapsed after a year, and that all  heavy  smokers relapsed after 3 months. Other studies, however, have found no increased risk for ulcers in smokers. Smoking does not appear to increase susceptibility to  Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) , the bacteria that causes many peptic ulcers.   Click the icon to see an image of peptic ulcers. Hepatitis and Cirrhosis . Smoking is linked to increased liver scarring (cirrhosis) caused by either excessive drinking or chronic hepatitis B or C viruses. Smoking and Thyroid Disease Cyanide, a chemical found in tobacco smoke, interferes with thyroid hormone production. Smoking triples the risk for developing thyroid disease, particularly hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Women smokers with subclinical hypothyroidism (a symptom-free condition in which the thyroid gland is mildly underactive) have a higher risk for developing full-blown hypothyroidism than their nonsmoking peers. Smoking has also been linked to goiter, a swelling of the thyroid that occurs in people who do not get enough iodine.   Click the icon to see an image of the thyroid. Smoking and Surgical Recovery Smokers are at increased risk for heart and circulatory problems and delayed wound healing after surgery. In one study, patients who were able to cut down or quit smoking 6 - 8 weeks prior to knee or hip replacement surgery were much less likely to suffer complications. Smoking and Age-Related Disorders The following age-related conditions occur at higher rates in smokers than nonsmokers: Cataracts. Quitting smoking reduces your chances of needing cataract surgery in the future, although not to the level seen with nonsmokers.   Click the icon to see an image of a cataract. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a leading cause of blindness in older people. An Australian study, published in 2007 found that the condition is four times more likely in persons who smoke than those who have never done so. Symptoms of macular degeneration include a loss of central vision, which makes it difficult to read. Gum disease and tooth loss. A government study found that more than half of the cases of severe gum disease in adults in the United States may be due to cigarette smoking. Wrinkles. Studies confirm that smokers are nearly five times more likely to develop more and deeper wrinkles as they age compared to nonsmokers. Baldness and premature gray hair. Certain chemicals in smoke break down in hair cells, which leads to hair damage. Hearing loss, particularly high-frequency hearing loss. Some experts believe that losing the ability to hear high pitched sound in smokers may be due to a decrease in blood flow to the cochlea, the part of the ear that carries sound to the brain. Incontinence. One study of 600 women indicated that smokers and former smokers are twice as likely to develop incontinence as women who never smoked. Secondhand Smoke Secondhand smoke is produced by a burning cigarette or other tobacco product. An estimated 4 million children a year get sick from being around secondhand smoke. Parental smoking has been shown to affect the lungs of infants as early as the first 2 - 10 weeks of life, and such abnormal lung function could persist throughout life. Exposure to secondhand smoke in the home increases the risk for asthma and asthma-related emergency room visits in children who have existing asthma. Parental smoking is believed to increase the risk for lower respiratory tract infections (such as bronchitis or pneumonia) by 50%. Environmental exposure to smoke is thought to be responsible for 150,000 - 300,000 such cases every year. Smoking Bans More and more households in the United States are banning smoking. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 75% of households now forbid smoking at any time or place in the home. Smoking bans have spread across the country. By October 2007, at least 22 states and the District of Columbia have passed some type of law banning smoking in almost all public places and workplaces, including restaurants and bars. The date an individual state's ban takes effect varies greatly; some do not take effect until 2008 or 2009. As of January 1, 2006, nine states were considered ""smoke-free"" -- California, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Quitting Smoking It's never too late to quit smoking. According to the American Cancer Society, about half of all smokers who keep smoking will die from a smoking-related disease. Quitting has immediate health benefits. Better Health After Quitting Time after last cigarette Physical Response 20 minutes Blood pressure and pulse rates return to normal. 8 hours Levels of carbon monoxide and oxygen in the blood return to normal. 24 hours Chance of heart attack begins to decreases. 48 hours Nerve endings start to regrow. Your ability to taste and smell increases. 72 hours Bronchial tubes relax and the lungs can fill with more air. 2 weeks to 3 months Improved circulation; lung function increases up to 30%. 1 to 9 months Decreased rates of coughing, sinus infection, fatigue, and shortness of breath; regrowth of cilia in the airways, increasing the ability to clear mucus and clean the lungs and reducing the chance of infection; overall energy level increases. Long-Term Effects After a year, the risk of dying from heart attack and stroke is reduced by up to 50%. According to the National Institutes of Health, about 40% of smokers who want to quit make a serious attempt to do so each year, but fewer than 5% actually succeed. A June 2006 report published by the NIH says that the available smoking cessation products and therapies are greatly underused. If more smokers asked for or were offered such help, the agency says quit rates could double or triple. Some people have certain genes that make quitting easier. Researchers at Duke University have identified more than 200 genes that distinguish those who have successfully kicked the habit. It is the first time such genes have been identified. The findings could lead to new smoking cessation therapies that target a person's specific genetic makeup. Methods of quitting smoking include counseling and support groups, nicotine patches, gums, lozenges, and sprays, smoking cessation pills, and slowly cutting back on the number of cigarettes smoked (incremental reduction). Cold Turkey About 4% of smokers who quit without any outside help succeed. Nevertheless, most people try to quit alone, and many have reported activities that can help the process of withdrawal. The primary obstacle in trying to quit alone is making the behavioral changes necessary to eliminate the habits associated with smoking. Excellent books, tapes, and manuals are available and are strongly recommended to help people who want to quit without other assistance. Nicotine Replacement Therapy Nicotine replacement therapy involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine that do not contain the contaminant found in smoke. The goal of therapy is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease the symptoms of withdrawal. In general, nicotine replacement therapy benefits moderate-to-heavy smokers the most. However, it does appear somewhat helpful for light smokers (people who smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes a day). Nicotine Patches.  Nicotine patches deliver nicotine through the skin. This is called transdermal nicotine delivery. It is effective in reducing symptoms during withdrawal. Nicotine patches are available over the counter. Patches may work in different ways: Step-Down Approach. Patches that use this method include NicoDerm CQ. The patches come in three strengths (21, 14, and 7 mg). You use the strongest dose first and reduce it gradually over a period of 8 - 10 weeks. A 21 mg patch is about equal to 15 cigarettes. A heavy smoker may need to wear two patches at first. Single-Step Approach. The single-step patch (Nicotrol) can be taken off after 16 hours and replaced 8 hours later. It can be used for only 6 weeks. Patches are applied and used in similar ways: A single patch is worn each day and replaced after 24 hours. To avoid skin irritation it is applied to different hairless locations above the waist and below the neck each day. People can wear the patches for 24 hours, but some have reported odd dreams and have disliked the sensation of the patch during the night. People who wear the patch all the time, however, have fewer withdrawal symptoms and slightly better abstinence rates than those who take it off at night. Patches should be stored and discarded safely, particularly in homes with small children. Small children have been poisoned and gotten sick from wearing, chewing, or sucking on nicotine patches. There have been no reports of death from children who have been poisoned. The FDA recommends using the patches for 3 - 5 months, although some studies suggest that using them for 8 weeks achieves the maximum benefits. Children should not come in contact with the patches, even while the smoker is wearing them. If the child has worn the patch, the affected skin should be washed right away. Urgent medical care may be required if the child has eaten nicotine or worn a patch for a prolonged time. Nicotine Gum.  Nicotine gum (Nicorette) is available over the counter and has helped many people quit. Some prefer it to the patch because they can control the nicotine dosage, and chewing satisfies the oral urge associated with smoking. Tips for using the gum: If you are just starting to quit, chew 1 - 2 pieces each hour. A smoker should not chew more than 20 pieces a day. The goal is to stop using the gum by 6 months, but about 3% of people continue to use it long after they have quit smoking. The gum must be chewed slowly until it develops a peppery taste. It is then tucked between the gum and cheek where it is stored so that the nicotine can be absorbed. Coffee, tea, soft drinks, and acidic beverages may interfere with nicotine absorption, so people should wait at least 15 minutes after drinking before chewing a piece of gum. Some people prefer other methods or cannot use the gum for the following reasons: They find the gum unpleasant tasting. Side effects specific to the gum may include upset stomach, mouth ulcers, hiccups, and throat irritation. They are embarrassed by chewing gum. They wear dentures. Long-term dependence may be a problem with the gum. Although such dependence is probably safer than smoking, research is needed to confirm this, and experts recommend people chew gum for no more than 6 months. The Nicotine Inhaler.  The nicotine inhaler resembles a plastic cigarette holder. It comes with a number of nicotine cartridges, which are inserted into the inhaler and ""puffed"" for about 20 minutes, up to 16 times a day. The dose is gradually decreased. It requires a prescription in the United States. Several studies have reported that the inhaler triples abstinence rates (between 17 - 28%) compared with placebo (6 - 9%) after 6 months. It has some specific advantages over other nicotine replacement products: The inhaler provides varying doses of nicotine on demand (as opposed to continuously with the patch or the gum) and is relatively fast-acting. Blood nicotine levels peak about 20 minutes after using the inhaler, comparable to the gum and faster than the 2 - 4 hours seen with the patch. It satisfies oral urges. Most of the nicotine vapor is delivered in the mouth, not into the lung airways (although some people experience mouth or throat irritation and cough). Using a combination of the inhaler and the patch may be particularly effective. In one study, the combination led to an abstinence rate of over 60% after 6 weeks. While this percentage dropped off over time, it was still a large improvement over the use of the inhaler and a placebo patch. The Nicotine Nasal Spray.  The nasal spray satisfies immediate cravings by providing doses of nicotine rapidly and thus may play a useful role in conjunction with slower-acting nicotine replacement therapies. (Nicotine levels peak within 5 - 10 minutes after administering the spray). The spray can irritate the nose, eyes, and throat, so it may not be suitable for those with allergies or sinus infections. Most people, however, can tolerate the side effects, which usually go away within the first few days. Nicotine Lozenge.  A nicotine lozenge (Commit) is available over the counter. It is made from pressed tobacco and comes in two strengths for heavier or lighter smokers. In a large 2002 study, 15 - 18% of smokers who used it remained smoke free, compared to 6 - 10% who were given a dummy lozenge. Side effects included heartburn, hiccups, nausea, headaches, and cough. The Commit lozenge also contains phenylalanine, a chemical that certain people may need to avoid. Facts about Nicotine Replacement Therapy: Not cheating on the very first day of nicotine-replacement use increases the chance of quitting permanently by tenfold. The more cigarettes a patient smokes, the higher the dose of nicotine replacement may be required at the start. Adding a counseling program may boost the effect of any nicotine replacement program. Do not smoke while using nicotine replacement. It can cause nicotine to build up to toxic levels. Nicotine replacement helps prevent weight gain while it is being used, but people are still at higher risk for gaining weight when they stop all nicotine. Side Effects.  Side effects of any nicotine replacement product may include headaches, nausea, and other gastrointestinal problems. People often experience sleeplessness in the first few days, particularly with the patch, but the insomnia usually passes. Patients using very high doses are more likely to have symptoms. Reducing the dose can prevent them. Special Concerns for Specific Individuals.  There has been some concern that the patch might be harmful for people with heart or circulatory disease, but studies are finding that it poses no danger for these individuals. In fact, it may help reduce angina attacks brought on by exercise. However, unhealthy cholesterol levels (lower HDL levels) caused by smoking remain abnormal with use of the nicotine patch. HDL levels improve when all nicotine is stopped. Nicotine replacement may not be completely safe in pregnant women, although it has been used successfully in this group without ill effect. There is an increase in heart rates in unborn children of women who use the patch as compared with those who smoke. Keep all nicotine products away from children. Nicotine is a poison. All nicotine products should be kept safely away from small children. A parent should call a physician or a poison control center immediately if a child has been exposed to a nicotine replacement product, even for a short duration. Parents should also call the doctor if a small child has been exposed to a nicotine product and has any symptoms, including stomach upset, irritability, headaches, a rash, or fatigue. Warnings Against Long-Term Use.  No one should use nicotine replacement therapies as a long-term substitute for smoking. Any nicotine replacement therapy should be temporary. In one study, use of nicotine gum for more than a year was associated with insulin resistance, an abnormality that occurs in diabetes. Some studies have now suggested that nicotine itself may have properties that increase the risk for cancer, independent of carcinogenic chemicals in smoke. More studies are needed. Smoking Cessation Pills Bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin) is a type of antidepressant that is also an FDA-approved product for smoking cessation. It differs from most other antidepressants because it increases the effects of dopamine, the brain chemical that appears to play a strong role in nicotine addiction. Using Zyban along with nicotine replacement therapy may help you better control cigarette smoking cravings. Zyban does not contain nicotine. In most cases, Zyban is taken a week or two before quitting, and must be taken for 7 - 12 weeks. The usual maintenance dose is 150 mg tablet twice a day. No single dose should be higher than 150 mg. Side effects of bupropion include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, insomnia, dry mouth, and irritation. In very rare cases, seizures have occurred, although usually in people who exceeded the recommended dose or who already had risk factors for seizures. A newer drug called varenicline (Chantrix) may significantly reduce cigarette cravings and work better than Zyban. A study in the  Archives of Internal Medicine  found that almost 50% of those who took varenicline successfully quit. Varenicline mimics some effects of nicotine on the brain, but blocks others. Previous studies published in the  Journal of the American Medical Association  showed that Chantrix works twice as well as Zyban and quadruples ones chances of successfully quitting. The FDA approved Chantrix as a smoking cessation aid in May 2006. It is for use in cigarette smokers age 18 and older. It should not be combined with nicotine replacement therapy. Antidepressants The tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl) may help reduce nicotine action. Quit rates with either of these medicines are as high as 30%. Long-term abstinent rates are more than twice those of placebo. Most other antidepressants, including fluoxetine (Prozac), have no additional benefits for smokers. Nortriptyline has been specifically studied for helping smokers. It is best to start taking the medication 10 - 28 days before your intended quit date. Studies have reported quit rates of 14 - 24%. Side effects of nortriptyline include dry mouth and changes in taste. It should be noted that in rare cases, tricyclics can have serious side effects, and overdose can be deadly. Tricyclics may pose a danger for some patients with certain types of heart disease. Behavioral Methods and Counseling Smokers who use outside help have the best record for quitting, with success rates of 25 - 35%. Those who are counseled in addition to using nicotine replacement and Zyban have the best chance. Brochures, audio tapes, and other self-help materials are often ineffective when used alone, but may be helpful in conjunction with a counseling program. Types of behavioral approaches: Problem Solving or Coping Strategies.  Smokers more likely to quit smoking when they learn thinking (cognitive) and behavioral techniques for breaking the link between certain cues and smoking, stress management techniques, and ways to handle the symptoms of withdrawal and the urge to relapse. The more intense the counseling program, the better. Smokers should look for programs that offer the following: Session lengths of 20 - 30 minutes Four to seven sessions A 2-week program Additional 2 weeks or more of follow-up contact Scheduled Reduction.  Scheduled reduction is a gradual way to stop smoking. Divide the number of minutes per day that you are awake by the number of daily cigarettes you smoke. The number you get is how long you wait between smokes. Week 1: Set up a schedule with time intervals based on this result and using a timer, smoke only at those intervals. If the ""cigarette appointment"" is missed by more than 5 minutes, you must skip that cigarette. Week 2: Reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke by one-third and recalculate your time between smokes based on the lower number. Week 3: Reduce the count again. Week 4: Quit smoking Those who are unable to smoke during working hours could try calculating the intervals based on the usual smoking times of the day. The Staged Approach.  The intent of the staged approach is to plan quitting interventions customized for each individual rather than imposing some general method for quitting. The approach takes the smoker through six stages with behavioral interventions at each point: Pre-contemplation Contemplation Preparation Action Maintenance Termination Although some studies report this approach is significantly more effective than non-staged methods, an analysis of 23 trials did not find the staged approach to be any more effective than other methods. Most studies, however, were weak, and better research is needed on this approach. People who follow this approach do not proceed from one stage to another in a simple, step-by-step fashion. They actually cycle or spiral back and forth, so that they may move from stage 1 to 2 to 3, and then back to 2 again. They may stay in maintenance mode for years and then fall back to stage 2. Remember that this is normal -- if you tried quitting in the past and didn't stick with it, don't consider yourself a failure. Just try again. Stage 1: Pre-Contemplation. People at this stage have no plans or desire to stop smoking. They aren't even considering quitting. People at this stage are generally unaware of the specific benefits that quitting can bring. Or, they may simply have ""failed"" in the past and have given up. There's no point in talking about how to start a cessation program at this stage. Instead, it is important to think about how quitting will help you feel better, have more confidence, or live longer. The benefits must be identified before a person will consider quitting. If you are at this stage, a good activity is to ask several friends or family members why they quit. Stage 2: Contemplation. A person at this stage is thinking, ""I think I should probably quit, but I need help getting started."" People at this stage know that quitting is good for them, but it seems like a daunting task or they don't think they can pull it off. Some may have tried and failed in the past. It's important for people at this stage to consider some of the truths and falsehoods of quitting. If you are at this stage, write down (brainstorm) all your potential roadblocks -- the things that you believe make quitting difficult -- and learn strategies for overcoming or side-stepping those hurdles. People at this stage might benefit from making a pledge, contract, or other commitment that they are going to get more active in the near future. The goal is to identify the roadblocks and ways to overcome these hurdles, and make a commitment to quitting. Stage 3: Preparation. Smokers at this stage are ready to quit. The goal of this stage is to create a specific action plan that takes all factors into account, so that quitting is successful. People at this stage need to know what methods work and what support exists to help them. If you are at this stage, you should consider some backup plans -- what to do when the urge to smoke hits you. Stage 4: Action! People at this stage have just quit. This stage is where the most behavioral change occurs. It requires significant commitment and energy. If you are at this stage, keep talking to friends and family for inspiration. Review your backup plans. Reward yourself for small achievements. Having a fellow smoker quit with you can be a huge support as you both get through this stage. Stage 5: Maintenance. People at this stage have been smoke-free at least 6 months. The goal now is to prevent relapse. If you are at this stage, continue to be wary of roadblocks and keep reminding yourself of the benefits you have gained. Think about what you have found most enjoyable about being smoke-free. Alternative Methods for Quitting Hypnosis.  Although rigorous studies are lacking, some people report successful cessation from smoking when hypnosis is given in individual sessions. The process is effective only if you trust the therapist and can feel completely at ease in the vulnerable and passive state necessary for hypnotic suggestion. During a typical session, the hypnotherapist will use various techniques (such as imagery, silent counting) to put you in a relaxed state. When you are very relaxed, but not asleep, the hypnotherapist quietly suggests motivations for not smoking. The hypnotherapist should also reinforce a positive self-image while you are in deep relaxation. This helps many people avoid the depression that accompanies withdrawal. The sessions usually takes about 1 hour. You should be taught methods of self-hypnosis to use at home, and follow-up once to reinforce what you've learned. Acupuncture and Acupressure . The acupuncture technique for quitting smoking usually uses very tiny curved staples inserted into three different points around the edge of the ear. The procedure is painless. You will be told to press each staple in a certain order for a few seconds whenever the craving for a cigarette occurs. The acupuncturist may also use acupuncture points elsewhere on the body. There are no side effects except for some soreness if the acupuncture staple is pressed too hard. A related technique called acupressure involves simply pressing select points on the body when a craving hits. Some studies have reported good quit rates with acupuncture, but few rigorous studies have been conducted using this approach. Some Tips for Quitting Aim to Quit Completely Everyone who quits should aim to quit completely. Most people who return to smoking ""cheat"" in the first few weeks. Quitting completely is essential to regain good health and reverse bad effects caused by smoking. Reducing smoking, even by half, does not eliminate the risk for cancer and other health problems. Although smokers take in less smoke and nicotine, the body is still unable to heal itself from the ongoing intake of toxins. It should also be noted that changing to low-tar cigarettes is not a solution. In fact, smokers of these cigarettes tend to inhale deeper, perhaps even increasing health risks. Create a List Write down 10 reasons to quit. In addition to health reasons, the list might include having better smelling hair, clothes, and breath; having fewer wrinkles; enjoying the taste of food; and saving money. Read the list often during the quitting process to help stay motivated. Decide on a Specific Quit Date Some people find it helpful to choose a particular date to quit when little or no stress is anticipated for at least the first 3 days. Women affected by PMS should avoid quitting right before their menstrual cycle. It may help to write out a quit contract, putting the date on paper, and getting a friend to sign it. Discard all smoking paraphernalia on the eve before the quit date, and make plans to stay busy on the day itself, and especially at night, when the urge to smoke will be high. Make an Oath Take an extreme oath. For example, ""If I smoke one more cigarette my dog will die."" Although this seems absurd, some people, even well-educated individuals, who have failed all other methods have reported that they quit completely and successfully after taking such an oath. Let the Body and Mind Heal During Withdrawal Retreat from the world when cravings become overwhelming. Take naps, warm baths or showers, meditate, or read novels. Help your body get rid of nicotine. Drink plenty of water, eat fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fiber-rich foods. Carrots, apples, and celery   "

[ 1 ]  In most cases it is painful, and thus is often referred to as a  sore throat . Inflammation of the tonsils ( tonsillitis ) and/or larynx ( laryngitis ) may occur simultaneously, which can make eating difficult or painful.   Most cases are caused by  viral   infections  (40%-60%), with the remainder caused by  bacterial  infections,  fungal  infections, or irritants such as  pollutants  or  chemical substances . [ 2 ]   Treatment of viral causes are mainly symptomatic while bacterial or fungal causes may be amenable to antibiotics and antifungals respectively.

This is because viruses and bacteria often settle in this part of the body after a person inhales dust or water vapour containing the microorganism. Infection can also arise when a person touches their nose or mouth after having touched an object shared with another person with the disease. The foreign invader reproduces rapidly after settling on the body tissue.     [ edit ]   Viral pharyngitis   These comprise about 40-60% of all infectious cases and can be a feature of many different types of viral infections.     Adenovirus  - the most common of the viral causes. Typically the degree of neck  lymph node  enlargement is modest and the throat often does not appear red, although is very painful.   Orthomyxoviridae  which cause  influenza  - present with rapid onset high temperature, headache and generalised ache. A sore throat may be associated.   Infectious mononucleosis  (""glandular fever"") caused by the  Epstein-Barr virus . This may cause significant lymph gland swelling and an  exudative  tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The  heterophile test  can be used if this is suspected.   Herpes simplex virus  can cause multiple  mouth ulcers .   Measles   Common cold virus :  rhinovirus ,  coronavirus ,  respiratory syncytial virus ,  parainfluenza virus  can cause infection of the throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often extreme pain.   Primary  HIV       [ edit ]   Bacterial pharyngitis   A number of different bacteria can infect the human throat. The most common is  Group A streptococcus , however others include,  Corynebacterium diphtheriae ,  Neisseria gonorrhoeae ,  Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and  Mycoplasma pneumoniae . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Streptococcal pharyngitis       Main article:  Streptococcal pharyngitis       The most common bacterial agent is  streptococcus . It causes about 15-30% of cases of pharyngitis. [ 3 ]  Unlike adenovirus, there tends to be greater generalized symptoms and more signs to find. Typically enlarged and tender lymph glands, with bright red, inflamed, and swollen throat of sudden onset with severe pain (often the patient finds it painful to talk or swallow), the patient may have a high temperature, headache, and aching muscles ( myalgia ) and joints ( arthralgia ). White or yellow spots on the back of the throat may be present on exam. These spots may also appear on the tonsils when those glands are involved.   It may be impossible to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of sore throat. [ 4 ]   Coughing is usually absent in strep throat though a dry, nonproductive cough (similar to how a person clears his or her voice) may appear in some patients; in addition coughing may appear when there is co-infection with a virus. A stuffy nose is also considered uncommon and is more likely due to a virus instead of the strep bacteria.   Some immune-system meditated complications may occur:     Scarlet fever  with its vivid  rash , although the milder disease seen after the 1950s suggests that the bacteria may have mutated to less virulent illness and some doctors now call this  scarlatina  (literally a ""little scarlet fever"") [ citations needed ]   Historically the most important complication was of the generalized inflammatory disorder of  rheumatic fever  which could later result in  Rheumatic heart disease  affecting the valves of the heart. Antibiotics may reduce the incidence of this complication to under one-third.     [ 5 ] However the incidence of rheumatic fever in developed-regions of the world remains low even though the use of antibiotics has been declining. [ 6 ]   [ 7 ] This may be a result of a change in the prevalence of various strains of bacteria. In underdeveloped regions, untreated streptococcal infection can still give rise to rheumatic heart disease and may be due to environmental factors, or reflect a genetic predisposition of the patient to the disease.     Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis  is an inflammation of the kidney. It is disputed whether antibiotics might reduce [ 8 ]  the small risk of this or not. [ 5 ]   Very rarely there may occur a secondary infection behind the tonsils which may cause a life-threatening  septicaemia  ( Lemierre's syndrome ) [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Diphtheria   Diphtheria  is a potentially life threatening upper respiratory infection caused by  Corynebacterium diphtheriae  which has been largely eradicated in developed nations since the introduction of childhood  vaccination  programs, but is still reported in the  Third World  and increasingly in some areas in  Eastern Europe . Antibiotics are effective in the early stages, but recovery is generally slow.     [ edit ]   Other causes   Some cases of pharyngitis are caused by fungal infection such as  Candida albicans  causing  oral thrush .     [ edit ]   Treatment   Treatment can be divided into symptomatic and remedial. Symptomatic treatments attempt to reduce pain and discomfort. Remedial treatments attempt to cure pharyngitis.   Remedial treatments are effective for bacterial infections and fungal infection. No specific treatment for viral infections have been found to be effective and most cases will settle within a few days.     [ edit ]   Symptomatic treatments     Analgesics such as  NSAIDs  and  acetaminophen  can help reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. [ 9 ]   Steroids: A single dose of  dexamethasone  reduces symptoms. This can either be given by mouth or intra-muscularly. [ 10 ]   Viscous lidocaine relieves pain by numbing the mucus membranes of the throat. [ 11 ]       [ edit ]   Remedial treatments     Antibiotics  are useful if a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For viral sore throats, antibiotics have no effect. These infections are treated by controlling or relieving symptoms until the virus runs its course. [ 5 ]   Antiviral drugs  do not decrease the length of illness and are not used except in cases when the patient's immune system is compromised. [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Alternative treatments   Many alternative treatments are promoted and used in sore throats. They are however poorly supported by evidence and  Uptodate  recommends that they not be used to treat pharyngitis. [ 12 ]  Some include  gargling  with a warm  salt  solution,  eucalyptus , and  chamomile .

Acting Director      Division of Unintentional Injuries Prevention    Christine Branche, Ph.D.  Director        Reducing Falls and Resulting Hip Fractures Among Older Women     Judy A. Stevens, Ph.D.  Sarah Olson, M.S.  National Center for Injury Prevention and Control  Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention  Abstract   Scope of the Problem : Fall-related injuries are the leading cause of injury deaths and disabilities among older adults (i.e., persons aged  > 65 years). The most serious fall injury is hip fracture; one half of all older adults hospitalized for hip fracture never regain their former level of function. In 1996, a total of 340,000 hospitalizations for hip fracture occurred among persons aged  > 65 years, and 80% of these admissions occurred among women. From 1988 to 1996, hip fracture hospitalization rates for women aged  > 65 years increased 23%.  Etiologic or Risk Factors : Risk factors for falls include increasing age, muscle weakness, functional limitations, environmental hazards, use of psychoactive medications, and a history of falls. Age is also a risk factor for hip fracture. Women aged  > 85 years are nearly eight times more likely than women aged 65-74 years to be hospitalized for hip fracture. White women aged  > 65 years are at higher risk for hip fracture than black women. Other risk factors for hip fracture include lack of physical activity, osteoporosis, low body mass index, and a previous hip fracture.  Recommendations for Prevention : Because approximately 95% of hip fractures result from falls, minimizing fall risk is a practical approach to reducing these serious injuries. Research demonstrates that effective fall prevention strategies require a multifaceted approach with both behavioral and environmental components. Important elements include education and skill building to increase knowledge about fall risk factors, exercise to improve strength and balance, home modifications to reduce fall hazards, and medication assessment to minimize side effects (e.g., dizziness and grogginess).  Program and Research Needs : Coordination needs to be improved among the diverse Federal, state, and local organizations that conduct fall prevention activities. The effectiveness of existing fall prevention programs among specific groups of women (e.g., those aged  > 85 years or living with functional limitations) needs careful evaluation. New primary fall prevention approaches are needed (e.g., characterizing footwear that promotes stability), as well as secondary prevention strategies (e.g., protective hip pads) that can prevent injuries when falls occur. Finally, efforts are needed to increase collaboration among national experts from various disciplines, to reach consensus regarding priority research areas and program issues, and to work toward long-term strategies for reducing falls and fall-related injuries among older adults.  Conclusion : Persons aged  > 65 years constitute the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Without effective intervention strategies, the number of hip fractures will increase as the U.S. population ages. Fall prevention programs have reduced falls and fall-related injuries among high-risk populations using multifaceted approaches that  include education, exercise, environmental modifications, and medication review. These programs need to be evaluated among older adults aged  > 65 years who are living independently in the community. In addition, secondary prevention strategies are needed to prevent hip fractures when falls occur. Effective public health strategies need to be implemented to promote behavioral changes, improve current interventions, and develop new fall prevention strategies to reduce future morbidity and mortality associated with hip fractures among older adults.    BACKGROUND     Older adults (i.e., persons aged  > 65 years) are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. In 1990, 13% of the population was aged  > 65 years; by 2050, this proportion will nearly double to 23% ( 1 ). The number of persons aged  > 65 years is projected to increase from 31.0 million in 1990 to 68.1 million by 2040; for persons aged  > 85 years, the relative growth is even faster ( 1 ). This report summarizes current knowledge about falls and hip fracture among women aged  > 65 years and describes both primary and secondary strategies for preventing fall-related injuries. When discussing research results, the term ""significant"" refers to a documented p-value of p  <  0.05.    SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM     Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths and disabilities among persons aged  > 65 years. In the United States, one of every three older adults falls each year ( 2,3 ). In 1997, nearly 9,000 persons aged  > 65 years died from falls ( 4 ). Of those who fall, 20%-30% sustain moderate to severe injuries that reduce mobility and independence and increase the risk for premature death ( 5 ). Older adults are hospitalized for fall-related injuries five times more often than they are for injuries from other causes ( 5 ), and women are nearly three times more likely than men to be hospitalized for a fall-related injury ( 5 ).  The most prevalent fall-related injuries among older adults are fractures of the hip; spine; upper arm; forearm; and bones of the pelvis, hand, and ankle ( 6 ). Of these, the most serious injury is hip fracture, a leading cause of morbidity and excess mortality among older adults ( 7 ). During 1988-1996, the estimated number of hospital admissions for hip fracture increased from 230,000 to 340,000 ( Figure 1 ). In 1996, 80% of the admissions for hip fracture occurred among women ( 8 ).  The rate of hospitalization for hip fracture differs by sex. The hip fracture hospitalization rate for persons aged  > 65 years is significantly higher for women than men ( 9 ). During 1988-1996, the rates for women increased significantly, from 972 per 100,000 to 1,356; for men, rates remained stable ( 9 ). A  Healthy People 2010  objective is to reduce the hip fracture hospitalization rate among women aged  > 65 years to no more than 879 per 100,000 (objective 15-28a).  Hip fracture hospitalization rates are substantially higher for white women than black women. In 1996, the hospitalization rate for white women aged  > 65 years was 1,174 per 100,000, five times the rate for black women ( 9 ). A  Healthy People 2010  objective is to reduce hip fracture hospitalization rates among white women aged  > 65 years to no more than 932 per 100,000 (objective 15-28a).  The overall increase in hip fracture hospitalization rates can be explained in part by the increasing U.S. population of very old adults (i.e., persons aged  > 85 years). Today, a  larger proportion of the population is living to age  > 85 years than in the past because of reduced mortality from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Since 1987, death rates from coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer have declined, and the proportion of adults aged  > 70 years living with some functional limitation* has increased ( 10 ). Frail older adults are twice as likely to fall as healthier persons ( 11 ).  Hip fractures are expensive. A recent study documented that the cost of a hip fracture (including direct medical care, formal nonmedical care, and informal care provided by family and friends) was $16,300-$18,700 during the first year following the injury ( 12 ). In 1991, hip fracture accounted for an estimated $2.9 billion in Medicare costs ( 13 ). On the basis of the annual cost of hip fracture in 1984, an assumption that the average cost will remain constant, an inflation rate of 3%-5%, and the increasing number of hip fractures, the estimated total annual cost of hip fracture in the United States could reach $82-$240 billion by the year 2040 ( 14 ).  An even more important factor than the monetary cost of hip fracture is the injury's impact on a person's life in the form of loss of independence and decreased quality of life. Nationwide, only 50% of older adults hospitalized for hip fracture are able to return home or live independently after the injury ( 15,16 ).    ETIOLOGIC OR RISK FACTORS     Approximately 95% of hip fractures are caused by falls ( 17 ). Other causes include being knocked over and being injured in a motor-vehicle crash; <2% of hip fractures occur spontaneously (e.g., as the result of a metabolic bone disease) ( 17 ). Not all falls are equally likely to cause hip fracture. Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that, although both bone strength and the force of the impact are important factors, the point of impact must be on or near the hip for a fall to cause a hip fracture ( 18 ).  Many factors contribute to falls and subsequent fall injury. Fall risk increases rapidly with advancing age for persons aged  > 65 years ( 19 ). Other fall risk factors include lack of current or previous physical activity ( 20,21 ), muscle weakness or balance problems that can contribute both to the risk for falling and the inability to break the impact of a fall ( 2,22,23 ), functional limitations (e.g., difficulty with activities of daily living such as dressing or bathing) ( 22,24 ), cognitive impairment or dementia ( 2 ), use of psychoactive medications (e.g., tranquilizers or antidepressants), some combinations of medications ( 2,25 ), environmental factors (e.g., tripping hazards) ( 26 ), having fallen previously ( 27 ), having more than one chronic disease ( 28 ), having had a stroke ( 28 ), Parkinson disease ( 29 ) or a neuromuscular disease ( 30 ), urinary incontinence ( 31 ), and visual difficulties ( 32,33 ). Less clear is the fall risk associated with wearing shoes with thick, soft soles (e.g., jogging shoes) that can affect balance and proprioception or become a tripping hazard by catching in carpeting ( 34 ).  Similar to fall risk, hip fracture risk increases sharply with advancing age ( 19 ). Women aged  > 85 years are nearly eight times more likely than women aged 65-74 years to be hospitalized for hip fracture ( 9 ). White women aged  > 65 years are at higher risk for hip fracture ( 19 ) than black women, in part because the prevalence and severity of osteoporosis -- a condition that predisposes to bone fragility -- is greatest among white women. Other risk factors include low body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared [weight [kg]/height squared [m 2 ]) ( 7,35,36 ), previous history of osteoporosis ( 27 ), and having sustained a previous hip fracture ( 27 ).   Falls are caused by personal (intrinsic) and environmental (extrinsic) factors. Personal risk factors include problems with gait and balance, functional impairments or limitations in activities of daily living, visual problems, and behavioral risk factors (e.g., lack of physical activity and taking certain psychoactive medications such as tranquillizers or antidepressants). Environmental factors include home hazards (e.g., clutter; no stair railings; loose rugs or other tripping hazards; no grab bars in the bathroom; and poor lighting, especially on stairs). Frequently, a fall is the result of an interaction between personal and environmental factors.    RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION      Because approximately 95% of hip fractures result from falls ( 17 ), minimizing fall risk is a practical approach to reducing these serious injuries. Primary prevention of fall-related injuries involves reducing the occurrence of falls; secondary prevention of fall-related injuries involves preventing injuries when falls occur.    Primary Prevention     Primary prevention of fall-related injuries among older adults can be targeted to persons living independently in the community or residents of nursing homes. Research has established that effective fall intervention programs employ a multifaceted approach and incorporate both behavioral and environmental elements: exercises to improve strength and balance, environmental modifications, education about fall prevention, medication review and assessment to minimize side effects, and risk factor reduction ( 36-39 ).    Community Intervention     Approximately 90% of adults aged  > 65 years live in the community and many fall prevention programs target these persons; however, few of these programs have been evaluated for effectiveness. During 1990-1992, a prospective, multifaceted, fall- prevention study was conducted among 301 community-dwelling men and women who were aged  > 70 years and had at least one fall risk factor (e.g., sedative use or some limitation in arm or leg strength) ( 36 ). A total of 153 persons participated in an intervention that consisted of behavioral instructions and training to reduce specific risk factors (e.g., persons with gait or balance impairments received specialized training in these areas), exercise programs to increase strength, and medication adjustments. After 1 year, the group that received the intervention had 30% fewer falls than the control group. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such a program among all persons aged  > 65 years living independently in the community.  Physical Activity.  Increasing physical activity can be an effective component of fall prevention programs. Activities that improve strength, balance, and coordination can reduce the risk for falls and fall-related injuries among healthy ( 40,41 ) and frail persons ( 42 ). Studies have demonstrated a 40%-60% reduction in hip fracture risk with increasing levels of physical activity ( 36,43 ). Although fall prevention programs have focused on several techniques to improve strength, balance, coordination, mobility, and flexibility, Tai Chi is probably the most frequently studied type of exercise ( 40 ). Effective programs have been employed with persons of different ages and with varied physical abilities;  however, persons with functional limitations might require more individualized physical activity programs ( 44 ).  Environmental Modifications.  Because approximately 50%-60% of all falls among older adults occur at home, fall prevention programs should address home hazards that can contribute to falls ( 45 ). Home-visiting programs (e.g., those using visiting nurses) provide opportunities to identify potential fall hazards and take corrective action. These programs can increase awareness of fall risks among informal caregivers, (e.g., family and friends who frequently visit the homes of older adults) and the older adults themselves.  Health Education.  Fall prevention programs frequently include health education and health promotion materials about reducing fall hazards that are distributed at central locations (e.g., senior centers or health fairs). However, educational materials alone might not promote behavioral changes. Many programs employ home-hazard checklists that can be used by the caregiver or health agency personnel (e.g., a visiting nurse or home health aide) to help persons identify fall hazards and to suggest corrective action (e.g., eliminating potential tripping hazards such as clutter and throw rugs, adding stair railings, improving lighting, adding nonslip floor surfaces, and installing grab bars in bathrooms). Checklists are also given to residents to help them assess personal and environmental risks and take preventive action, including behavioral changes ( 45 ). Research is needed to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of educational materials and home-hazard checklists to promote fall-risk reduction activities and behaviors.  Risk Factor Reduction.  Approaches that address specific risk factors can supplement fall prevention program efforts. Medical approaches might include reducing fall risk factors (e.g., maximizing control of concomitant chronic diseases) and reducing hip fracture risk factors (e.g., counseling women aged  > 65 years against inappropriate weight loss).    Nursing-Home Intervention     Nursing-home residents, who constitute approximately 5% of the population aged  > 65 years, are at particularly high risk for fall-related injuries. Approximately one half of the estimated 1.7 million nursing-home residents in the United States fall at least once each year, and 11% sustain a serious fall-related injury ( 46 ). A randomized trial of seven pairs of nursing homes that included 500 residents evaluated an intensive, multifaceted intervention of extensive environmental modifications (e.g., obtaining wheel locks for beds, changing lighting, modifying floor plans, and purchasing raised toilet seats), medication review, and increased attention to individual resident needs ( 39 ). Repeat falls declined 19% among nursing-home residents who had fallen at least once during the previous year. However, approximately one third of the safety recommendations implemented in the study group were discontinued within 3 months of the completion of the study. Strategies are needed to institutionalize fall prevention interventions in the nursing-home setting, and additional programs designed for high-risk nursing-home residents need to be implemented and evaluated.    Secondary Prevention     Secondary prevention strategies are being developed to reduce the incidence of hip fracture among older women ( 47 ). Most hip fractures are caused by falling directly on the hip, and biomechanical studies have demonstrated that a pad that shunts the energy  away from the point of impact is highly effective in reducing the force of a fall on the proximal femur ( 48 ). A 1993 clinical study in a Copenhagen nursing home demonstrated that hip protectors reduced the risk for hip fracture by approximately 50% ( 47 ). During 1994-1996, researchers in Finland conducted a study to determine whether nursing-home residents would wear an undergarment with energy-shunting hip pads. The findings indicated that 63% of the residents wore the pads ( 49 ). U.S. manufacturers have considered producing and marketing an undergarment with energy-absorbing hip pads, but how acceptable and effective this garment might be among community-dwelling older adults is unknown.  A promising technologic innovation for preventing fall-related injuries is a recently developed safety floor ( 50 ). Under laboratory conditions, this flooring material provides a firm walking surface and, if a fall occurs, reduces the force of impact through the use of special energy-absorbing flooring material. Field trials are under way in nursing homes to evaluate the effectiveness of this material in preventing fall-related hip fractures among nursing-home residents.    PROGRAM AND RESEARCH AGENDA     Many professional and community-level organizations within the public health community, federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and state and local health departments are involved in efforts to reduce falls and fall-related injuries among older adults. However, coordination among these entities has been limited. CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control has funded the National Resource Center on Aging and Injury at San Diego State University to collect, organize, and evaluate information and to increase awareness about preventing unintentional injuries among older adults. Information will be available through fact sheets, formal publications, and the Internet (at < http://www.olderadultinjury.org >) and will be provided to health-care professionals, caretakers, and other persons concerned about reducing injuries among older adults.  Researchers do not know all the factors that contribute to falls and fall-related injuries or how personal and environmental factors interact to cause a fall. These factors have been difficult to identify because persons frequently cannot explain the causes or circumstances surrounding fall events. In one prospective study, one fourth to one third of the participants did not remember a fall that occurred 36 months earlier ( 51 ). Older adults might either blame themselves for falling or consider falls to be an inevitable consequence of the aging process. Longitudinal prospective studies are needed to accurately assess the associations between fall risk factors (e.g., interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic factors), the occurrence of falls, and fall outcomes (e.g., frequency of falls, whether an injury results, and level of injury severity).  To decrease the incidence and severity of fall-related injuries, injury-prevention programs for older adults need to integrate research findings into multifaceted, community-level programs that include both implementation and evaluation components. A model program would employ a prospective design to accurately record fall occurrences and establish whether a fall resulted in an injury. Such a program should incorporate four critical elements: a) education and skill-building activities to increase knowledge about fall risk factors, b) exercise to increase strength and improve balance, c) home safety modifications and repairs to reduce fall hazards, and d) medication review to maximize  control of comorbid conditions while reducing adverse side effects. Because persons must take an active role to reduce their risk for falling, a model fall prevention program should also include effective strategies to promote behavioral changes.  Because of the increasing number of persons aged  > 65 years in the United States, the need is increasing to develop an effective national plan to address the problem of falls and fall-related injuries within the constraints of limited health-care resources. To accomplish this goal, efforts are needed to increase collaboration among national experts from various disciplines (e.g., gerontologists, health educators, behavioral epidemiologists, home designers, and ergonomic experts), to reach consensus regarding the priority research areas and program issues, and to work toward long-term strategies for reducing falls and fall-related injuries among older adults.  Some subgroups of older adults (e.g., women aged  > 85 years and older adults with functional limitations) might have different fall-injury risks than most community- dwelling older adults ( 44 ). Efforts are needed to adapt existing fall prevention programs or develop new interventions to reduce falls in these groups. Finally, in addition to existing behavioral and environmental interventions, new fall prevention approaches (e.g., characterizing footwear that promotes stability and developing more effective home lighting) need to be developed.    CONCLUSION     Persons aged  > 65 years constitute the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. The average life expectancy for both men and women is increasing, in part because of healthier life styles and better control and treatment of chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease). Without effective intervention strategies, the number of hip fractures will increase as the U.S. population ages.  Fall prevention programs have effectively reduced falls in select populations by 30%-50%, using multifaceted approaches that include various combinations of education, exercise, medication assessment, risk factor reduction, and environmental modifications. Such programs need to be expanded to include multiple intervention components tailored for diverse populations of older adults and evaluated for effectiveness. In addition, secondary prevention strategies (e.g., reducing the amount of energy transferred to the hip) are needed to prevent hip fracture when falls occur.  The problem of fall-related hip fractures will continue to increase unless effective intervention strategies are developed and implemented to improve fall prevention interventions and expand existing programs. Older adults must take an active role in reducing their risk for falling. Because most older adults live independently, fall prevention programs must include effective strategies to promote behavioral changes. Innovative and effective fall prevention strategies are needed to reduce future morbidity and mortality associated with hip fractures, increase independence, and improve quality of life for the growing number of older adults.

Paul St. Amand . The proposed treatment involves three parts: titrating to the proper  guaifenesin  dosage, avoiding  salicylates , and following a  low-carbohydrate diet  if the patient is  hypoglycemic .  Guaifenesin  has not been approved by the  FDA  for the treatment of fibromyalgia, and the protocol has not been shown to be effective in clinical trials as of 2008. It has been adopted by many due to anecdotal evidence of success; however a clinical study in 1996 has cast doubt on the effectiveness of Guaifenesin. [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Treatment details     1.1   Guaifenesin dosage   1.2   Avoiding salicylic acid   1.3   Treating hypoglycemia       2   Theory of fibromyalgia cause   3   History   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Treatment details     [ edit ]   Guaifenesin dosage   The dosage is individually determined by slowly  titrating  the dosage up until a worsening of symptoms is noticed and there is a decrease of the  lesions  that can be palpated in the  muscles . Patients begin with 300  mg  twice a day and increase from there. The guaifenesin should be pure guaifenesin and not a preparation including other medications.     [ edit ]   Avoiding salicylic acid   Salicylic acid  in even tiny amounts blocks guaifenesin from binding in the  kidneys . It is present in many drugs such as  aspirin , Salsalate, Disalcid, Anacin, and Excedrin. Plants produce salicylic acid, so  herbal medications  must be avoided as well as plant oils, gels and extracts in  cosmetics  and any product that touches the skin. These ingredients include  aloe ,  castor oil ,  camphor , and  mint . Any plants can be eaten, however, because the small amount of salicylic acid present in food is broken down in the  digestive system  and tagged with  glycine  by the  liver  before reaching the kidneys.     [ edit ]   Treating hypoglycemia   Many symptoms of  hypoglycemia  (or perhaps more aptly titled Carbohydrate Intolerance) are similar to fibromyalgia, and, while leaving hypoglycemia untreated will not hinder the reversal of the disorder with guaifenesin, the symptoms will continue to plague the patient. The only treatment is a life-long avoidance of  simple sugars ,  caffeine ,  starchy  foods, and any other foods that cause  insulin  spikes.     [ edit ]   Theory of fibromyalgia cause   This theory involves  phosphate  accumulation in cells that eventually reach a level to impede the  ATP  process, possibly caused by a kidney dysfunction or missing  enzyme  that prevents the removal of excess phosphates from the blood stream. This theory posits that fibromyalgia is an  inherited disorder , and that phosphate build up in cells is gradual (but can be accelerated by  trauma  or  illness ).  Calcium  is required to buffer the excess phosphate when it enters the cells. The additional phosphate slows down the ATP process; however the excess calcium prods the cell to action. The causative mechanism in the kidneys is unknown.   The phosphate build-up theory is said to explain the myriad symptoms present in fibromyalgia and provides an underlying cause, but remains theoretical; there is no clinical evidence that the phosphate build-up theory is correct, or that Guaifenesin protocol is effective.   Results of the only reported randomized clinical trial in 1996 found that guaifenesin had no significant effects on pain, other symptoms, or laboratory measures (serum and urinary levels of uric acid and phosphate) over 12 months in a sample of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome, [ 1 ]  The lead author of the study has suggested a number of reasons why some patients may have previously reported benefits on this protocol, concluding ""Dr. St. Amand has unknowingly used guaifenesin as a powerful focus in a program of cognitive behavioral therapy, in which his empathy, enthusiasm and charisma were the real instruments in effecting a beneficial change."" [ 2 ]  Dr. St. Amand has noted that the study did not control for salicylate use, and therefore did not study the protocol as a whole. He has recommended a follow-up study be conducted which controls for all elements of the protocol. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   History   This theory arose when Dr. St. Amand noticed that patients with fibromyalgia symptoms had an increase of  tartar  on the  teeth  in the form of calcium phosphate. Crystals are also often found on  urinalysis , which further points to calcium phosphate, and muscle  biopsies  show an increase of phosphate in the  cytosol . Lesions of muscles,  tendons , and  ligaments  can be felt by a method of palpation called mapping developed by Dr. St. Amand. These lesions are thought to be contracted cells forming a spastic area caused by an excess of calcium in the cytosol of the cells.   The treatment was discovered serendipitously when the physician found that  uricosuric  drugs for treating  gout  also coincided with relief of fibromyalgia symptoms. Guaifenesin is mildly uricosuric but, unlike standard uricosuric drugs, has almost no side-effects. Dr. St. Armand therefore began to study whether guaifenesin might relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia while causing fewer side-effects than other uricosuric drugs had caused.

Most of the deaths from heart attacks are caused  by ventricular fibrillation of the heart that occurs before the victim of the  heart attack can reach an emergency room. Those who reach the emergency room  have an excellent prognosis; survival from a heart attack with modern treatment should exceed 90%.  The 1% to 10% of heart attack victims who die later include those victims who  suffer major damage to the  heart muscle  initially  or who suffer additional damage at a later time. Fortunately, procedures such as    coronary angiogram  and  PTCA  ( coronary balloon angioplasty ), and clot dissolving drugs are available that can quickly open  blocked arteries in order to restore circulation to the heart and limit heart  muscle damage. In order to optimally benefit heart attack victims and limit the  extent of heart damage, these treatments to open blocked arteries should be  given early during a heart attack.    Knowing the early warning signs of heart attack        is critical for prompt  recognition and treatment. Many heart attacks start slowly, unlike the dramatic  portrayal often seen in the movies. A person experiencing a heart attack may not  even be sure of what is happening. Heart attack symptoms vary among individuals,  and even a person who has had a previous heart attack may have different  symptoms in a subsequent heart attack. Although  chest pain  or pressure  is the most common symptom of a heart attack, heart attack victims may experience a  diversity of symptoms that include:       Pain, fullness, and/or squeezing sensation of the    chest      Jaw pain,  toothache ,  headache             Read the rest of the heart attack symptoms and warning signs  »               Top Workplace Health Terms         heart attack symptoms ,  heart attacks in women ,  heart attack risk factors ,  heart attack causes ,  heart attack prevention ,  heart attack treatment                      What is a heart attack?   A heart attack (also known as a myocardial infarction) is the death of heart muscle from the sudden blockage of a coronary artery by a blood clot. Coronary arteries are blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood and oxygen. Blockage of a coronary artery deprives the heart muscle of blood and oxygen, causing injury to the heart muscle. Injury to the heart muscle causes  chest pain  and chest pressure sensation. If blood flow is not restored to the heart muscle within 20 to 40 minutes, irreversible death of the heart muscle will begin to occur. Muscle continues to die for six to eight hours at which time the heart attack usually is ""complete."" The dead heart muscle is eventually replaced by scar tissue.   Approximately one million Americans suffer a heart attack each year. Four hundred thousand of them die as a result of their heart attack.     What causes a heart attack? Atherosclerosis   Atherosclerosis is a gradual process by which plaques (collections) of cholesterol are deposited in the walls of arteries. Cholesterol plaques cause hardening of the arterial walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. Arteries that are narrowed by atherosclerosis cannot deliver enough blood to maintain normal function of the parts of the body they supply. For example, atherosclerosis of the arteries in the legs causes reduced blood flow  to the legs. Reduced blood flow to the legs can lead to pain in the legs while walking or exercising, leg ulcers, or a delay in the healing of wounds to the legs. Atherosclerosis of the arteries that furnish blood to the brain can lead to vascular  dementia  (mental deterioration due to gradual death of brain tissue over many years) or  stroke  (sudden death of brain tissue).   In many people, atherosclerosis can remain silent (causing no symptoms or health problems) for years or decades. Atherosclerosis can begin as early as the teenage years, but symptoms or health problems usually do not arise until later in adulthood when the arterial narrowing becomes severe. Smoking cigarettes,  high blood pressure ,   elevated cholesterol , and  diabetes mellitus  can accelerate atherosclerosis and lead to the earlier onset of symptoms and complications, particularly in those people who have a family history of early atherosclerosis.   Coronary atherosclerosis  (or coronary artery disease) refers to the atherosclerosis that causes hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries. Diseases caused by the reduced blood supply to the heart muscle from coronary atherosclerosis are called coronary heart diseases (CHD). Coronary heart diseases include heart attacks, sudden unexpected death, chest pain ( angina ), abnormal heart rhythms, and heart failure due to weakening of the heart muscle.   Atherosclerosis and angina pectoris   Angina pectoris  (also referred to as angina) is chest pain or pressure that occurs when the blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle cannot keep up with the needs of the muscle. When coronary arteries are narrowed by more than 50 to 70 percent, the arteries may not be able to increase the supply of blood to the heart muscle during exercise or other periods of high demand for oxygen. An insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle causes angina. Angina that occurs with exercise or exertion is called  exertional angina.  In some patients, especially diabetics, the progressive decrease in blood flow to the heart may occur without any pain or with just shortness of breath or unusually early fatigue.   Exertional angina usually feels like a pressure, heaviness, squeezing, or aching across the chest. This pain may travel to the neck, jaw, arms, back, or even the teeth, and may be accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, or a cold sweat. Exertional angina typically lasts from one to 15 minutes and is relieved by rest or by taking  nitroglycerin   by placing a tablet under the tongue. Both resting and nitroglycerin decrease the heart muscle's demand for oxygen, thus relieving angina. Exertional angina may be the first warning sign of advanced coronary artery disease. Chest pains that just last a few seconds rarely are due to coronary artery disease.   Angina also can occur at rest. Angina at rest more commonly indicates that a coronary artery has narrowed to such a critical degree that the heart is not receiving enough oxygen even at rest. Angina at rest infrequently may be due to spasm of a coronary artery (a condition called Prinzmetal's or variant angina). Unlike a heart attack, there is no permanent muscle damage with either exertional or rest angina.    Atherosclerosis and heart attack   Occasionally the surface of a cholesterol plaque in a coronary artery may rupture, and a blood clot forms on the surface of the plaque. The clot blocks the flow of blood through the artery and results in a heart attack (see picture below). The cause of rupture that leads to the formation of a clot is largely unknown, but contributing factors may include   cigarette smoking  or other  nicotine exposure , elevated LDL cholesterol, elevated levels of blood catecholamines (adrenaline), high blood pressure, and other mechanical and biochemical forces.  Unlike exertional or rest angina, heart muscle dies during a heart attack and loss of the muscle is permanent, unless blood flow can be promptly restored,  usually within one to six hours.     While heart attacks can occur at any time, more heart attacks occur between  4:00 A.M. and 10:00 A.M. because of the higher blood levels of adrenaline released from the adrenal glands during the morning hours. Increased adrenaline, as previously discussed, may contribute to rupture of cholesterol plaques.   Approximately 50% of patients who develop heart attacks have warning symptoms such as exertional angina or rest angina prior to their heart attacks, but these  symptoms may be mild and discounted.    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   Next »     Heart Attack Index   Glossary         Next:   What are the symptoms of a heart attack? »         Heart attack - Symptoms at Onset of Disease   The MedicineNet physician editors ask:   The symptoms of  heart attack can vary greatly from patient to patient.

About half of them die. Many people have permanent heart damage or die because they don't get help immediately. It's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 9-1-1 if someone is having them.  Those symptoms include      Chest discomfort - pressure, squeezing, or pain    Shortness of breath    Discomfort in the upper body -  arms, shoulder, neck, back    Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, sweating        These symptoms can sometimes be different in  women .    What exactly is a heart attack? Most heart attacks happen when a clot in the coronary artery blocks the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. Often this leads to an irregular heartbeat  called an  arrhythmia  - that causes a severe decrease in the pumping function of the heart. A blockage that is not treated within a few hours causes the affected heart muscle to die.

Hip fractures can have serious consequences. A person may be unable to do daily activities, may be unable to live independently, or may develop a serious disorder leading to death. To help prevent hip fractures, people can become or continue to be active. Being active strengthens muscles and bones. It also improves the chances of a good recovery if a hip fracture occurs. Other precautions can also help.    In the United States, about 350,000 people fracture a hip each year. About 9 out of 10 hip fractures occur in people over 60. Hip fractures are much more common among women.    Types and Causes    Most hip fractures occur at or near the upper end (head) of the thighbone (femur). (The head of the thighbone fits into the pelvic bone to form the hip joint—a ball-and-socket joint.) There are two common types of hip fractures. Femoral neck (subcapital) hip fractures occur just below the thighbone's head, in the neck of the thighbone. Intertrochanteric hip fractures occur in the area just below the neck, where the thighbone broadens. There are two large bumps (called trochanters) in this area. They provide a sturdy place for the muscles of the legs and buttocks to be attached to.    The bones may be broken in different ways. The broken bone may remain in place (aligned or nondisplaced) even if the bone is cracked all the way through. The ends of the broken bone may be separated (displaced). Or one end may be jammed (impacted) into the other.    Most hip fractures result from a fall. However, when osteoporosis or another disorder has weakened the bone, a hip fracture may result from the stresses of ordinary activity (such as getting in and out of a chair).    Symptoms and Diagnosis    Hip fractures almost always cause pain, weakness in the affected leg, or both. Pain occurs partly because the ends of the broken bone move around, injuring the surrounding tissue. Most people with a displaced hip fracture cannot walk or stand. When they are lying on their back, the affected leg may appear shorter than the other leg, and the foot of the affected leg turns out (rather than pointing straight up). Some people with an impacted hip fracture can walk, although with pain.    People with an intertrochanteric hip fracture may become light-headed or weak or even go into shock. These symptoms indicate that blood pressure has fallen: Blood pressure falls if a fracture damages blood vessels and causes bleeding inside the hip. Large bruises may develop around the hip.    The stress of having a hip fracture can lead to other problems. Pain due to a hip fracture, the drugs used to control pain, and the experience of hospitalization and surgery may cause an older person to become confused, disoriented, forgetful, and anxious. A change in living arrangements, if needed, can be upsetting. A person may become depressed, especially if a fracture disrupts normal activities and requires a lot of time and adjustments while healing. Family members should report changes in mental function after a hip fracture to a health care practitioner.    After a femoral neck hip fracture, severe, painful arthritis may develop. Arthritis can develop if the fracture disrupts the blood supply to the head of the thighbone. Without a good blood supply, the bone heals slowly or incompletely, and it may eventually die and collapse.    Most hip fractures can be seen on x-rays. However, if the fracture is small, a second x-ray (taken a day or two later), computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be needed to detect it.    Prevention and Treatment    Preventing hip fractures involves preventing falls, strengthening bones to prevent osteoporosis, and protecting bones. One way to protect bones is to wear a specially designed hip protector (a thigh-length undergarment with padding along its sides). Many hip protectors can be worn comfortably under clothing.    Treatment usually consists of surgery. Surgery prevents the ends of the broken bones from moving and thus relieves pain. Surgery also enables most people to get out of bed and begin to walk again almost immediately. At first, almost everyone uses a walker. For people who have a serious disorder, such as a recent heart attack, surgery may be too risky. For these people, bed rest is continued until they recover enough for surgery to be safe. Rarely, surgery is not done—for example, for people who were permanently unable to walk before the fracture and who are not experiencing pain.    The type of surgery depends on the type and severity of the fracture and on the person's activity level.     See the figure  Repairing a Broken Hip.    For some femoral neck hip fractures, metal pins can be inserted surgically to hold the bone together. For intertrochanteric hip fractures, a different type of metal implant is used. A plate is attached to the top part of thighbone with compression screws. The screws allow the fragments to move closer to each other and grow together. These procedures, which are types of internal fixation, preserve the person's own hip joint.    For more severe femoral neck hip fractures, the head and neck of the thighbone are removed and replaced in a procedure called partial hip replacement (hemiarthroplasty). They are replaced with a smooth metal sphere on a metal stem. The stem is inserted into the center of the thighbone's shaft and usually cemented in place. The sphere is made to fit into the person's hip socket.     See the figure  Replacing a Hip.    Sometimes, especially if arthritis has damaged the hip socket, total hip replacement is necessary. In this operation, the hip socket is replaced as well as the head and neck of the thighbone. The pelvic bone around the socket is shaped so that a metal cup can be inserted to replace the opening of the socket.    Traditionally, hip surgery involves a 9-inch incision at the hip joint. Afterward, people must stay in the hospital 3 to 5 days. They may be able to put full weight on the hip in a few days, or they may have to wait up to 6 weeks. New techniques that cause less pain, involve much smaller incisions (about 2½ to 3 inches), and result in a quicker recovery are being developed. However, whether the new techniques are as safe and effective as traditional surgery is not yet known.    After surgery for a hip fracture, rehabilitation is begun in the hospital as soon as possible.    Outlook    Many people recover reasonably well after a hip fracture. But full recovery may take up to a year. Being healthy, able to move (mobile), and active before the fracture makes a good recovery more likely. However, hip fractures may lead to serious problems, primarily because they limit a person's mobility. Only about one third of people regain the same amount of mobility they had before the fracture. After a hip fracture, about 2 out of 5 people 65 and over need to stay in a nursing home for at least a while. Some of them stay there indefinitely. A year after a hip fracture, some older people still need a walker or another aid to walk. Some people need home care. During the year after they have a hip fracture, about 1 out of 4 people aged 50 and over die. Most of the people who die are over 80.

Hip Fractures in the Elderly                            When Teresa Lang remembered a last-minute item she needed for her trip to Europe, she jumped up from her couch. She tumbled over a small suitcase on the floor, right into a wall. The instant I did this, before I hit the wall, I knew what had happened, says the 88-year-old Lang. She had broken her left hip. Hip fractures in the elderly are commonfor every 10 hip fractures, about nine occur in people over the age of 60. Hip fractures double with every five-year increase in age [after age 50], says Sandy B. Ganz, PT, DSc, GCS, the director of rehabilitation at Amsterdam  Nursing Home  in New York City. By 90 years of age, one in four women and one in eight men will have fractured a hip, according to a study done by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Hip fractures in the elderly are critical ailments, with possible life-endangering complications. Surgeries to fix breaks are common and consistently effective, while healing can take an entire year.  Causes and Risk Factors Elderly people are at a high risk for  falling , the usual traumatic event that leads to hip fractures. They fall because they lose their coordination. They have difficulty with their eye sight and they have difficulty with their balance, and they become weak, says Dr. Charles A. Peterson, an orthopedic surgeon at Seattle Orthopaedic and Fracture Clinic. When they fall, they tend to have a higher frequency of fractures due to osteoporosis and weaker bones. The risk factors for suffering a broken hip are numerous, including: Osteoporosis : This disease causes bones to become weaker, making them more susceptible to fracture. In the U.S., an estimated 10 million individuals already have  osteoporosis , and 80 percent of those affected are women. In this population, hip fractures can occur during simple weight-bearing activities.  Sex : Women lose bone density more quickly than men due to a decrease in estrogen levels after menopause begins. Heredity: Small-boned, slender-framed people; Caucasians; and Asians have an increased risk of suffering from osteoporosis. Nutrition : Poor nutrition in childhood increases hip-fracture risk. Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia damage bones. Tobacco and alcohol use : Smoking and drinking too much can lead to bone loss. Medications : Taking four or more medications at a time or taking any psychoactive medications are risk factors for falling. Home environment : Throw rugs and electrical wires are tripping hazards, as are a lack of stair railings and grab bars, unstable furniture, and poor lighting.  Medical conditions : The following conditions can increase the risk of hip fractures, either through bone loss or by increasing the risk of falling: endocrine disorders, such as type 1 diabetes; gastrointestinal disorders; rheumatoid disorders; prolonged bed rest or immobility; nervous system disorders such as  Parkinsons disease  or  multiple sclerosis ;  dementia ; and  depression . Signs and Symptoms Most often, an individual knows right away that she has broken her hip. For example, Lang was unable to stand up and was discovered by her son who happened to stop by that day. Usually severe pain is felt in the hip or groin areas and the person cannot walk. Other symptoms include stiffness, contusions, or inflammation in the hip area; the leg on the broken hip side is shorter or turns outward. If the head of the hip bone is impacted onto the neck of the hip bone, the person might not know he has a broken hip, as this break can be less painful, according to Peterson.  Because hip fractures in the elderly are life-threatening, make sure your loved one heads to a hospital immediately. Surgery to fix the fracture is usually done within 24 hours. The examining doctor can diagnose a broken hip simply from symptoms, but an x-ray or MRI will verify the break and display the fracture type.   Treatment: Surgery for Hip Fractures in the Elderly There are two main types of hip fractures, and older people almost always undergo surgery to repair these breaks: Femoral neck fracture : The femoral neck is right below the ball (or head) of the ball-and-socket hip joint. Because this type of fracture diminishes and can sometimes stop the flow of blood to the broken part of the bone, surgery is almost always done to correct it. Partial hip replacement, called hemiarthroplasty, replaces the ball and femoral neck with a metal prosthesis, usually made from stainless steel or chrome cobalt alloy. While the patient is under general or spinal anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision. The broken head is removed, and the surgeon clears out cartilage and damaged bone from the hip socket. The new socket, which includes a ball and stem, is cemented in place. Muscles and tendons are positioned around the prosthesis and the incision is closed .  If the patient has arthritis or a previous injury that has damaged the joint and they are physiologically sound, a total hip replacement may be done for a femoral neck fracture. Intertrochanteric region fracture : Just below the femoral neck, this is where the thigh bone juts out. The fracture runs between two bumps called trochanters. While the patient is under general or spinal anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision on the side of the thigh. The patients bones are manipulated to correct their position. A large screw called a hip nail is placed along the break and up into the femoral head. This screw is held to a metal plate that is attached to the outside of the thigh using several smaller screws. This plate and screw helps the bones heal, compressing them so they grow together.  A third type of break, called a  subtrochanteric fracture , occurs in the thigh bone or femur, and is quite rare. The surgical repair is similar to the plate and screw system used in intertrochanteric fractures, although the recovery period is much longer. In rare instances, people who have hip fractures do not have surgery. If someone is too sick for surgery to occur, traction or other methods are used to repair the break.  Recovery and Therapy        Although surgeries to repair fractures are straightforward and relatively simple fixes, complications after surgery can be dangerous. Mortality rates in the year following a hip fracture are about 25 percent. Complications include blood clots, infection, and  pneumonia . With a partial hip replacement, the patient can also dislocate the prosthesis before it stabilizes. If an individual has fragile bones, the hip nail or screw may pull out of the bone. Post-surgery complications more often lead to death if a patient already suffers from another serious medical condition.    Recovery after hip surgery is a lengthy process. The typical hospital stay lasts four days to a week, but a longer stay isnt unusual. Lang remained in the hospital for about a week, and then moved to a sub-acute rehabilitation center for a month. Now she is at home, receiving assisted care from her family, and two therapists work with her twice a week. After a hospital stay, patients can follow many different routes, depending on insurance, age, and complications. According to Ganz:          Some live in acute rehabilitation centers, which offer a minimum of three hours of physical and occupational therapy each day;                 Some patients live in a  skilled nursing facility  for sub-acute rehabilitation, which offers a minimum of 30 minutes per day of therapy;                 Others go straight home and receive  in-home assisted care  and therapy;                 Others go home with no  home care , but receive therapy as an out-patient in a private practice or hospital.        Up to 25 percent of community-dwelling seniors who sustain hip fractures remain in an institutional assisted care setting such as a  nursing home  for at least a year.   Physical and occupational therapists begin to work with recovering patients right at the hospital, helping them begin walking with assistance usually the day after surgery. Physical therapy intervention for a hip fracture usually consists of muscle re-education, strengthening exercises, balance retraining, bed mobility, and transfer and gait training, says Ganz. Occupational therapy focuses on the activities of daily living: dressing, grooming, bathing, as well as balance retraining and strengthening exercises. The amount of therapy a patient receives depends on insurance. Unfortunately, right about the time therapy typically ends, about four to six months post operatively, is when the patient is first physically and physiologically able to receive more intensive therapy, says Ganz.  While a patient may recover from surgery quickly, there is a difference between healing and recovery. After recovery, they can continue doing everything on their own to get stronger, says Jill Heitzman, PT, DPT, GCS, FCCWS, a physical therapist at Mary Greely Rehab and Wellness in Ames, Iowa. When they are actually healed, they are back to doing everything they want to do. Healing, she says, typically takes nine months to a year.   About 25 percent of hip fracture sufferers will experience a full recovery and return to a semblance of their post-fall life. Fifty percent will need to use a cane or walker, and about 20 percent of individuals who break their hip will permanently live in a  nursing home . Caregivers can help ensure the best outcome by helping their loved ones adhere to their therapy regimens and taking some preventive measures such as fall-proofing their homes. Prevention Ideally, one can prevent hip fractures in the elderly in the first place. People who have broken a hip also have a good chance of falling again. You can help by making sure your loved ones home environment is safe, as well as seeing that she stays as healthy as possible.  Homes, rehabilitation centers, and  nursing homes  all need to be fall-proofed. Ganz includes the following recommendations in a recently published  home-hazards  guide: Lighting should not be too dim or too direct, and light switches should be accessible. Carpets and rugs should be tacked down. Bathrooms should have a chair for bathing or skid-resistant mats, grab bars should be placed where needed and the toilet seat needs to be tall enough for easy transferring. Chairs need to be stable (without wheels) and have arm rests. Kitchen items that are frequently used should be at waist level or on low shelves, a rubber mat should be placed in front of the sink and non-slip wax should be used on the floor. Stairways need handrails and steps should not be slippery. There are several other simple suggestions that can help prevent falls and hip fractures. People need to have regular eye-checkups; wear sensible, hard-soled flat shoes; and be mindful of medications side effects. Individuals can also wear hip padding to minimize the impact of a fall. A doctor can talk with your loved one about how to increase her bone density through taking supplements, including bisphosphonates for osteoporosis sufferers, calcium, vitamin D, or starting estrogen or hormone replacement therapy, says Ganz.  Exercise is imperative for preventing falls. Heitzman recommends that a regimen includes: an aerobic workout that elevates heart rate and increases breathing capacity; a strength-training program that involves lifting against resistance; exercising on different surfacessuch as carpets, stairs, and gravelto challenge ones balance. Healing from a hip fracture takes time and patience. Seven weeks after her fall, Lang uses a walker to move around her apartment and the world outside. Before her accident, she occasionally used a cane for outings, saying she found it elegant. Now she looks forward to just using her cane. They say youll never be exactly how you were, but you will be a pretty good facsimile of that! says Lang.                                                                                              page 1 page 2                                                                      Post a Comment                                                                                                                                                                                       We can help you find the right elder care for  your  family.

Not all heart attacks begin with sudden, crushing chest            pain, the way they are so often shown in the movies and on TV.            Instead, the most common warning signal are:                                                                                     KNOW THE SYMPTOMS OF            HEART DISEASE.                                                           Pain of discomfort in the center of            the  chest  that lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes            back.               Pain that spreads from the chest to the              arm , neck, or jaw.                            Chest discomfort with sweating, shortness of breath, tiredness, or              upset stomach. These last three symptoms are particularly common in              women.                              Immediate Self-Help             If you experience             heart attack            symptoms  and are taking nitroglycerin medication, take one            nitroglycerin tablet as soon as you feel discomfort, a second tablet            if the discomfort does not go away in 5 minutes, and a third tablet            after 5 more minutes if you are still experiencing symptoms.            FLU SYMPTOMS             |              VASECTOMY REVERSAL             In addition, you should chew one            adult-strength (325 mg) uncoated aspirin. Whether or not you have been            prescribed nitroglycerin, you should take one aspirin. If the symptoms            stop, call your doctor immediately for further advice. If symptoms            continue, dial 9-1-1.             Getting Emergency Care -- A Must             If the above medications do not            relieve your discomfort within 15 minutes, get to the hospital fast.            Be sure you know the phone number to call for emergency            transportation. This is the best way to get to the hospital if you            could be having a heart attack. In many areas, the emergency number            will be 9-1-1; in other areas, it will be a 7-digit emergency number.            (For more information on what to do in case of a heart attack, see            ""Steps for Survival"")             Medical science now offers treatments            that can stop heart attacks in their tracks if the treatments are            given very quickly after the attack begins. These new treatments            include ""clot-dissolving"" drugs or coronary angioplasty (aslo called            balloon angioplasty) to reopen the clogged blood vessel that has cut            off the oxygen supply to the  heart . These treatments save lives and            reduce damage to the heart muscle -- but only if they are given            immediately.             New research shows that            clot-dissolving medicine also can be used to treat a stroke. But once            again, it must be used quickly in order to be effective. That means if            you have stroke symptoms, you should get emergency help immediately.                        W arning signs for stroke include weakness or numbness in the face,            arm, hand, leg, or foot; sudden blurred vision; difficulty speaking;            and sudden dizziness or loss of coordination.

(September 2007)           Pharyngitis   Classification and external resources                     Viral pharyngitis.  The  oropharynx  is swollen and red.       ICD - 10   J 02. ,  J 31.2       ICD - 9   462 ,  472.1       DiseasesDB   24580       MedlinePlus   000655       eMedicine   emerg/419         MeSH   D010612         For the English grindcore band, see  Sore Throat     Pharyngitis  ( IPA :  [farndts] ) is an inflammation of the throat or  pharynx . [ 1 ]  In most cases it is painful, and thus is often referred to as a  sore throat . Inflammation of the tonsils ( tonsillitis ) and/or larynx ( laryngitis ) may occur simultaneously, which can make eating difficult or painful.   Most cases are caused by  viral   infections  (40%-60%), with the remainder caused by  bacterial  infections,  fungal  infections, or irritants such as  pollutants  or  chemical substances . [ 2 ]   Treatment of viral causes are mainly symptomatic while bacterial or fungal causes may be amenable to antibiotics and antifungals respectively.

This is because viruses and bacteria often settle in this part of the body after a person inhales dust or water vapour containing the microorganism. Infection can also arise when a person touches their nose or mouth after having touched an object shared with another person with the disease. The foreign invader reproduces rapidly after settling on the body tissue.     [ edit ]   Viral pharyngitis   These comprise about 40-60% of all infectious cases and can be a feature of many different types of viral infections.     Adenovirus  - the most common of the viral causes. Typically the degree of neck  lymph node  enlargement is modest and the throat often does not appear red, although is very painful.   Orthomyxoviridae  which cause  influenza  - present with rapid onset high temperature, headache and generalised ache. A sore throat may be associated.   Infectious mononucleosis  (""glandular fever"") caused by the  Epstein-Barr virus . This may cause significant lymph gland swelling and an  exudative  tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The  heterophile test  can be used if this is suspected.   Herpes simplex virus  can cause multiple  mouth ulcers .   Measles   Common cold virus :  rhinovirus ,  coronavirus ,  respiratory syncytial virus ,  parainfluenza virus  can cause infection of the throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often extreme pain.   Primary  HIV       [ edit ]   Bacterial pharyngitis   A number of different bacteria can infect the human throat. The most common is  Group A streptococcus , however others include,  Corynebacterium diphtheriae ,  Neisseria gonorrhoeae ,  Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and  Mycoplasma pneumoniae . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Streptococcal pharyngitis       Main article:  Streptococcal pharyngitis       The most common bacterial agent is  streptococcus . It causes about 15-30% of cases of pharyngitis. [ 3 ]  Unlike adenovirus, there tends to be greater generalized symptoms and more signs to find. Typically enlarged and tender lymph glands, with bright red, inflamed, and swollen throat of sudden onset with severe pain (often the patient finds it painful to talk or swallow), the patient may have a high temperature, headache, and aching muscles ( myalgia ) and joints ( arthralgia ). White or yellow spots on the back of the throat may be present on exam. These spots may also appear on the tonsils when those glands are involved.   It may be impossible to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of sore throat. [ 4 ]   Coughing is usually absent in strep throat though a dry, nonproductive cough (similar to how a person clears his or her voice) may appear in some patients; in addition coughing may appear when there is co-infection with a virus. A stuffy nose is also considered uncommon and is more likely due to a virus instead of the strep bacteria.   Some immune-system meditated complications may occur:     Scarlet fever  with its vivid  rash , although the milder disease seen after the 1950s suggests that the bacteria may have mutated to less virulent illness and some doctors now call this  scarlatina  (literally a ""little scarlet fever"") [ citations needed ]   Historically the most important complication was of the generalized inflammatory disorder of  rheumatic fever  which could later result in  Rheumatic heart disease  affecting the valves of the heart. Antibiotics may reduce the incidence of this complication to under one-third.     [ 5 ] However the incidence of rheumatic fever in developed-regions of the world remains low even though the use of antibiotics has been declining. [ 6 ]   [ 7 ] This may be a result of a change in the prevalence of various strains of bacteria. In underdeveloped regions, untreated streptococcal infection can still give rise to rheumatic heart disease and may be due to environmental factors, or reflect a genetic predisposition of the patient to the disease.     Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis  is an inflammation of the kidney. It is disputed whether antibiotics might reduce [ 8 ]  the small risk of this or not. [ 5 ]   Very rarely there may occur a secondary infection behind the tonsils which may cause a life-threatening  septicaemia  ( Lemierre's syndrome ) [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Diphtheria   Diphtheria  is a potentially life threatening upper respiratory infection caused by  Corynebacterium diphtheriae  which has been largely eradicated in developed nations since the introduction of childhood  vaccination  programs, but is still reported in the  Third World  and increasingly in some areas in  Eastern Europe . Antibiotics are effective in the early stages, but recovery is generally slow.     [ edit ]   Other causes     [ edit ]   Candida albicans   Some cases of pharyngitis are caused by fungal infection such as Candida albicans causing  oral thrush .     [ edit ]   Fusobacterium necrophorum   Fusobacteria  are normal inhabitants of the oropharyngeal flora. After a strep sore throat has created a peritonsillar abscess, a crater filled with pus and bacteria near the tonsils,  Lemierre syndrome  can develop.     [ edit ]   Treatment   Treatment can be divided into symptomatic and remedial. Symptomatic treatments attempt to reduce pain and discomfort. Remedial treatments attempt to cure pharyngitis.   Remedial treatments are effective for bacterial infections and fungal infection. No specific treatment for viral infections have been found to be effective and most cases will settle within a few days.     [ edit ]   Symptomatic treatments     Analgesics such as  NSAIDs  and  acetaminophen  can help reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. [ 9 ]   Steroids: A single dose of  dexamethasone  reduces symptoms. This can either be given by mouth or intra-muscularly. [ 10 ]   Viscous lidocaine relieves pain by numbing the mucus membranes of the throat. [ 11 ]       [ edit ]   Remedial treatments     Antibiotics  are useful if a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For viral sore throats, antibiotics have no effect. These infections are treated by controlling or relieving symptoms until the virus runs its course. [ 5 ]   Antiviral drugs  do not decrease the length of illness and are not used except in cases when the patient's immune system is compromised. [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Alternative treatments   Many alternative treatments are promoted and used in sore throats. They are however poorly supported by evidence and  Uptodate  recommends that they not be used to treat pharyngitis. [ 12 ]  Some include  gargling  with a warm  salt  solution,  eucalyptus , and  chamomile .

Contents       1   Signs and symptoms   2   Diagnosis   3   Transmission   4   Treatment     4.1   Symptomatic therapies   4.2   Antibiotics       5   Complications   6   See also   7   References   8   External links               [ edit ]   Signs and symptoms   Streptococcal pharyngitis usually appears suddenly with a severe sore throat that may make talking or swallowing painful. In severe cases, breathing may be impaired.   Signs and symptoms may include:     Sudden and severe  sore throat   Inflamed  tonsils   Yellow and white patches in the throat   Difficulty swallowing   Tender  cervical   lymphadenopathy   Fever   Headache  (often prior to other symptoms)   General discomfort, feeling ill or uneasy   Halitosis   Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting   Rash [ 2 ]   Hives   Chills   Loss of appetite   Ear pain   Peeling of skin on hands and feet     Additional symptoms such as  sinusitis ,  vaginitis , or  impetigo  be present if the strep bacteria infects both the throat and a secondary location. For additional information on non-pharynx symptoms, see  Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Infection .     [ edit ]   Diagnosis   There are several causes for  pharyngitis , not just streptococcus bacteria. Productive coughing, nasal discharge, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat, though a co-infection with a virus is possible and may explain the presence of these additional symptoms. A  Rapid Strep Test  or a throat culture may be undertaken to help clarify diagnosis.   The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in  infectious mononucleosis  (glandular fever). [ 3 ]   A study of 729 patients with pharyngitis, in which 17% had a positive throat culture for group A streptococcus, identified the following four best predictors of streptococcus, also called the  Centor criteria : [ 4 ]     Lack of cough   Swollen and tender anterior  cervical lymph nodes   (Marked) tonsillar  exudates [ 5 ]   Fever             Number of symptoms   Probability of Strep       0   2.5%       1   6.0 - 6.9%       2   14.1  16.6%       3   30.1  34.1%       4   55.7%           Another study on 621 patients, assigned one point for each of the following symptoms: [ 6 ]     Temperature greater than 38 C   Absence of cough   Tender anterior cervical adenopathy   Tonsillar swelling or exudate   Age younger than 15   Subtracting a point for age older than 45.             Points   Probability of Strep   Management       1 or less   0%   Negative: No antibiotic       2   17%   Indeterminate: antibiotic based on throat culture       3   35%       4 or 5   51%   Positive: for throat culture and antibiotics            Finally, patients usually experience swelling of the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck, but swelling can also be located in the soft palate in the top of the mouth. The absence of tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar or pharyngeal exudates has been suggested as being the most useful finding in ruling out strep throat, with a negative likelihood of 0.74. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Transmission   Strep throat is caused by  Group A streptococcal infection  (GAS), [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  specifically the bacterium  Streptococcus pyogenes . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  It is spread by direct, close contact with an infected person via air-based germs. [ 16 ]  In addition, it may be spread through contamination of pillow cases, toys, toothbrushes and other often-used materials. [ 10 ]  Rarely, contaminated food, especially milk and milk products, can result in outbreaks. [ 17 ]   The  incubation period  for strep throat is thought to be between two to five days, but has been reported as long as eight days. [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment     [ edit ]   Symptomatic therapies   Nonprescription  over the counter drugs  of  ibuprofen  and  paracetamol  (acetaminophen) both help relieve throat pain and reduce fever by an average of 2.2F or 2.3F in children. [ 19 ]  Aspirin is not recommended for children due to the risk of  Reye's syndrome . In adults aspirin, paracetamol, or ibuprofen help reduce back pain by 48% and sore throat by 31%. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Antibiotics   Antibiotics will reduce symptoms slightly, as was the case in one study of 11 adult patients with sore throat and confirmed GAS infection. They were evaluated daily after the start of antibiotic treatment to register symptoms and signs and to measure body temperature. The mean reduction rate was great, but the greatest reduction was after 3 days. Out of all symptoms, reduction scores for muscle or joint pain was the most at 86%, and the lowest for sore throat at 67%. [ 21 ]  Treatment, which consists of penicillin (orally for 10 days or a single intramuscular injection of penicillin G), will also minimize transmission. This is why  GAS  positive children should not go back to school or day care until they have taken antibiotics for at least 48 hours. In one study the potential risk of transmission to close school contact was assessed by taking 47 children with positive throat cultures and randomly selecting them to receive penicillin V, penicillin G, or erythromycin. Throat cultures were then taken the morning after start of antibiotics and 17 (36.2%) had positive throat cultures. Cultures were taken again 24 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy, and only 12 (17%) of the patients still had positive throat cultures. [ 22 ]   Cephalosporins  (such as cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone) are recommended for penicillin-allergic patients. In another study, 41 patients with confirmed penicillin allergy were evaluated with cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxoneall cephalosporinsto see the allergic reaction. Skin tests with cephalosporins were clearly negative in 39 patients and all 41 patients tolerated the three cephalosporins administered. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]  Second-line antibiotics included amoxicillin, [ 25 ]  clindamycin, [ 26 ]  and oral cephalosporins which have a significantly better cure rate than penicillin. [ 27 ]   Studies have also shown that the broader-spectrum of antibiotics offer more effective short treatment courses than the traditional 10 days of Penicillin V, [ 28 ]  but noted that ""widespread use of broad-spectrum agents for a common infection is a significant concern in an age of increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance"". [ 29 ]  It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent rheumatic fever or an abscess on the tonsils. In one report of 500 patients, 30% had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, 0.2% had rheumatic fever and 0.2% had peritonsillar abscess (an abscess on the tonsils). [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Complications   The symptoms of strep throat usually improve even without treatment in five days, but the patient is contagious for several weeks. Lack of treatment or incomplete treatment of strep throat can lead to various complications. Some of them may pose serious health risks. Therefore, streptococcal tonsillitis is important to recognize and treat early. The patient is considered to be contagious up to three days after being treated with antibiotics. [ 30 ]   List of Complications arising from disseminated Streptococcal infection (originating in the throat) [ 31 ]     Scarlet Fever  : a red, raised skin rash caused by  toxins  released by the bacteria   Acute Rheumatic Fever  :  sore joints ,  heart disease ,  involuntary movements  and skin manifestations may occur   Streptococcal Toxic shock syndrome  : septic shock and multi-organ failure   Glomerulonephritis  : a form of  kidney failure  in which antibodies directed against the Streptococcus bacteria become lodged in the kidney, causing damage to the kidney itself   PANDAS Syndrome  : a neurological disorder which can result in permanent injury. Symptoms include  Obsessive-Compulsive  Type disorders and  involuntary movements   Herpes  may be aggravated post-infection     A skin disease known as  necrotizing fasciitis  may occur if Streptococcus bacteria infect a wound on the body, but this is not a complication of strep throat per se.

A heart attack occurs when the supply of blood and oxygen to  an area of heart muscle is blocked, usually by a clot in a coronary  artery. Often, this blockage leads to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat or rhythm) that cause a severe decrease in the  pumping function of the heart and may bring about sudden death. If the  blockage is not treated within a few hours, the affected heart muscle  will die and be replaced by scar tissue.          A heart attack is a life-threatening event. Everyone should know the warning signs of a heart attack and how to get emergency help. Many people suffer permanent damage to  their hearts or die because they do not get help immediately.       Each year, more than a million persons in the U.S. have a heart attack and about half (515,000) of them die.  About one-half of those who die do so within 1 hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital.      Emergency personnel can often stop arrhythmias with emergency  CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), defibrillation (electrical shock),  and prompt advanced cardiac life support procedures. If care is sought  soon enough, blood flow in the blocked artery can be restored in time  to prevent permanent damage to the heart. Yet, most people do not seek  medical care for 2 hours or more after symptoms begin. Many people wait  12 hours or longer.      A heart attack is an emergency. Call the emergency services if you think you (or  someone else) may be having a heart attack. Prompt treatment of a heart  attack can help prevent or limit lasting damage to the heart and can  prevent sudden death.        Other Names for Heart Attack     Myocardial infarction or MI      Acute myocardial infarction or AMI      Acute coronary syndrome      Coronary thrombosis      Coronary occlusion                   What Causes a Heart Attack?              Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one  of the coronary arteries (the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen  to the heart muscle). When blood cannot reach part of your heart, that  area starves for oxygen. If the blockage continues long enough, cells  in the affected area die.             Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the most common underlying cause of a heart attack. CAD is the  hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries by the buildup of  plaque in the inside walls (atherosclerosis). Over time, plaque buildup in the coronary arteries can:              Narrow the arteries so that less blood flows to the heart muscle           Completely block the arteries and the flow of blood          Cause blood clots to form and block the arteries.                A less common cause of heart attacks is a severe spasm (tightening) of the coronary artery that cuts off blood flow to the heart. These spasms can occur in  persons with or without CAD. Artery spasm can sometimes be caused by:              Taking certain drugs, such as cocaine           Emotional stress          Exposure to cold          Cigarette smoking.              What Makes a Heart Attack More Likely?               Certain factors make it more likely that you will develop CAD and have a heart attack. These are called  risk factors . Risk factors you cannot change include:              Your  age                       Men: over age 45              Women: over age 55                             Having a  family history of early heart disease                       Heart disease diagnosed in father or brother before age 55              Heart disease diagnosed in mother or sister before age 65                             Having a  personal history of CAD                       Angina              A previous heart attack              A surgical procedure (angioplasty, heart bypass) to increase blood flow to your heart.                                Risk factors that you can change include:              Smoking          High blood pressure          High blood cholesterol           Obesity          Being physically inactive          Diabetes (high blood sugar) .              What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Heart Attack?               The warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack can include:              Chest discomfort.  Most heart attacks involve discomfort in  the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or goes  away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable  pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Heart attack pain can sometimes  feel like indigestion or heartburn.          Discomfort in other areas of the upper body.  Can include pain, discomfort, or numbness in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach.          Shortness of breath.  Often comes along with chest discomfort. But it also can occur before chest discomfort.           Other symptoms.  May include breaking out in a cold sweat, having nausea and vomiting, or feeling light-headed or dizzy.             Signs and symptoms vary from person to person. In fact, if you have  a second heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same as for the  first heart attack. Some people have no symptoms. This is called a  ""silent"" heart attack.             The symptoms of angina can be similar to those of a heart attack. If you have angina and  notice a change or a worsening of your symptoms, talk with your doctor  right away.               Know the warning signs of a heart attack so you can act fast to get treatment.  Many heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms  begin before they seek medical help. This delay can result in death or  lasting heart damage.              If you think you may be having a heart attack, or if your angina  pain does not go away as usual when you take your angina medicine as  directed, call  for help. You can begin to receive life-saving  treatment in the ambulance on the way to an emergency room.               How is a Heart Attack Diagnosed?               Diagnosis (and treatment) of a heart attack can begin when  emergency medical personnel arrive after you call the emergency services. Don't put off  calling because you are not sure that you are having a heart  attack.             At the hospital emergency room, doctors will work fast to  find out if you are having or have had a heart attack. They will  consider your symptoms, medical and family history, and test results.  Initial tests will be quickly followed by treatment if you are having a heart attack.             Tests used include:              Electrocardiogram (ECG) . This test is used to measure the rate and regularity of your heartbeat. A 12-lead ECG is used in diagnosing a heart attack.           Blood tests . When cells in the heart die, they release  enzymes into the blood. They are called markers or biomarkers.  Measuring the amount of these markers in the blood can show how much  damage was done to your heart. These tests are often repeated at  intervals to check for changes. The specific blood tests are:                      Troponin test .  This test checks the troponin levels in the blood. It is considered the  most accurate blood test to see if a heart attack has occurred and how  much damage was done to the heart.              CK or CK-MB test . These tests check for the amount of the different forms of creatine kinase in the blood.              Myoglobin test . This test checks for the presence of myoglobin in the blood. Myoglobin is released when the heart or other muscle is injured.                             Nuclear heart scan .  This test uses radioactive tracers (technetium or thallium) to outline  heart chambers and major blood vessels leading to and from the heart. A  nuclear heart scan shows any damage to your heart muscle.          Cardiac catheterisation .  A thin flexible tube (catheter) is passed through an artery in the  groin or arm to reach the coronary arteries. Your doctor can determine  pressure and blood flow in the heart's chambers, collect blood samples  from the heart, and examine the arteries of the heart by x-ray.          Coronary angiography .  This test is usually performed along with cardiac catheterisation. A  dye that can be seen using x-ray is injected through the catheter into  the coronary arteries. Your doctor can see the flow of blood through  the heart and see where there are blockages.              How is a Heart Attack Treated?              A heart attack is a medical emergency. Delaying treatment can  mean lasting damage to your heart or even death. The sooner treatment  begins, the better your chances of recovering. Your treatment may begin  in the ambulance or in the emergency room and continue in a special  area called a coronary care unit or CCU.              In the Hospital               If you are having a heart attack, doctors will:              Work quickly to restore blood flow to the heart          Continuously monitor your vital signs to detect and treat complications             Restoring blood flow to the heart is vital to prevent or limit damage  to the heart muscle and to prevent another heart attack. The main  treatments are the use of thrombolytic (""clot-busting"") drugs and  procedures such as angioplasty.              Thrombolytic drugs (""clot-busters"") are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking blood flow to the  heart. When given soon after a heart attack begins, these drugs can  limit or prevent permanent damage to the heart.  To be most effective, they need to be given within 1 hour after of the start of heart attack symptoms.            Angioplasty procedures are used to open blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A  stent, which is a tiny metal mesh tube, may be placed in the artery to  help keep it open.          Coronary artery bypass surgery uses arteries or veins from other areas in your body to bypass your blocked coronary arteries.             The CCU is specially equipped with monitors that continuously  measure your vital signs. Those that can show signs of complications  include:              EKG, which detects any heart rhythm (arrhythmia) or functional problems          Blood pressure           Pulse oximetry, which measures the amount of oxygen in the  blood and provides an early warning sign of a low level of oxygen in  the blood.              Medications  used in treating heart attacks include:              Beta blockers to decrease the workload on your heart by slowing your heart rate. This  makes your heart beat with less force and lowers your blood pressure.  Some beta blockers are also used to relieve angina (chest pain) and in  heart attack patients to help prevent additional heart attacks. They  are also used to correct irregular heartbeat.          Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to lower blood pressure and reduce the strain on your heart. They are  used in some patients after a heart attack to increase survival rate  and help slow down further weakening of the heart.          Nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, to relax blood vessels and stop chest pain.           Anticoagulants  to thin the blood and prevent clots from forming in your arteries.          Antiplatelet  medications (such as aspirin and clopidigrel)  to stop platelets from clumping together to form clots. These  medications are given to people who have had a heart attack, have  angina, or who experience angina after angioplasty.          Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors, which are potent  antiplatelet medicines given intravenously to prevent clots from  forming in your arteries.          Medicines to relieve pain and anxiety.          Medicines to treat arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), which often occur during a heart attack.          Oxygen therapy.              The length of your hospital stay after a heart attack depends on your  condition and response to treatment. Most people spend several days in  the hospital after a heart attack. While in the hospital, your heart  will be monitored, and you will receive needed medications. You will  probably have further testing, and you will be treated for any  complications that arise.             While you are still in the hospital or after you go home after your heart attack, your doctor may order other tests, such as:              Echocardiogram .  In this test, ultrasound is used to make an image of your heart that  can be seen on a video monitor. It shows how well the heart is filling  with blood and pumping it to the rest of the body.          Exercise stress test .  This test shows how well your heart pumps at higher workloads when it  needs more oxygen. EKG and blood pressure readings are taken before,  during, and after exercise to see how your heart responds to exercise.  The first EKG and blood pressure reading are done to get a baseline.  Readings are then taken while you walk on an exercise treadmill or  pedal a stationary bicycle. The test continues until you reach a heart  rate set by your doctor. The exercise part is stopped if chest pain or  a very sharp rise in blood pressure occurs. Monitoring continues for 10  to 15 minutes after exercise or until your heart rate returns to  baseline.               Cardiac Rehabilitation (Rehab)              Your doctor may prescribe cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) to  help you recover from a heart attack and help prevent another heart  attack. Almost everyone who has survived a heart attack can benefit  from rehab.             The cardiac rehab team may include:               Doctors                      Your family doctor              A heart specialist              A surgeon                            Nurses           Exercise specialists          Physical therapists and occupational therapists          Dietitians          Psychologists or other behaviour therapists.             Rehab has two parts:               Exercise training  to help you learn how to exercise safely,  strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan  will be based on your individual ability, needs, and interests.          Education, counselling, and training  to help you  understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk of  future heart problems. The cardiac rehab team will help you learn how  to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and to deal  with your fears about the future.              After You Leave the Hospital               After a heart attack, your treatment may include cardiac rehab  in the first weeks or months, checkups and tests, lifestyle changes,  and medications. You will need to see your doctor for checkups and  tests to see how your heart is doing. Your doctor will most likely  recommend lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, losing weight,  changing your diet, or increasing your physical activity.             After a heart attack, most people take daily medications. These may include:              Aspirin          Medicines that lower your cholesterol or your blood pressure          Other medicines to help reduce your heart's workload.              Always take medications as your doctor directs.              How Can I Prevent a Heart Attack?              Most heart attacks are caused by coronary artery disease (CAD).  You can help prevent a heart attack by knowing about your risk factors  for CAD and heart attack and taking action to lower your risks.              You can lower your risk of having a heart attack, even if  you have already had a heart attack or are told that your chances of  having a heart attack are high.             To prevent a heart attack, you will most likely need to make  lifestyle changes. You may also need to get treatment for conditions  that raise your risk.              Make Lifestyle Changes              You can lower your risk for CAD and a heart attack by making healthy lifestyle choices:               Eat a healthy diet to prevent or reduce high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, and maintain a healthy weight          If you smoke, quit          Exercise as directed by your doctor          Lose weight if you are overweight or obese              Treat Related Conditions               In addition to making lifestyle changes, you can help prevent heart  attacks by treating conditions you have that make a heart attack more  likely:              High blood cholesterol . If you have high cholesterol, follow your doctor's advice about lowering your cholesterol. Take medications to lower your cholesterol as directed.          High blood pressure . If you have high blood pressure, follow your doctor's advice about keeping your blood pressure under control. Take blood pressure medications as directed.          High blood sugar (diabetes) .  If you have diabetes, follow your doctor's advice about keeping your  blood sugar levels under control. Take medications as directed.               Prevent a Second Heart Attack               If you have already had a heart attack, it is very important to follow your doctor's advice to prevent a second heart attack:              Make lifestyle changes as directed          Take your medications as directed           Follow any other treatment recommended by your doctor, such as cardiac rehabilitation.             By taking these steps, you can prevent or reduce the chance  of another heart attack and related complications, such as heart  failure.             Make sure that you have an emergency action plan in case you have signs of a second heart attack. Talk to your doctor  about making your plan, and talk with your family about it. The plan  should include:              The signs and symptoms of a heart attack          Instructions for the prompt use of aspirin and nitroglycerin           How to access emergency medical services in your community (most people dial the emergency services)          The location of the nearest hospital that offers 24-hour emergency heart care.             Remember, the symptoms of a second heart attack may not be the same as those of a first heart attack. If in doubt, call the emergency services.              Life after a Heart Attack               There are millions of people who have survived a heart attack. Many recover fully and are able to lead normal lives.             If you have already had a heart attack, your goals are to:              Recover and resume normal activities as much as possible          Prevent another heart attack          Prevent complications, such as heart failure or cardiac arrest.              After a heart attack, you will need to see your doctor  regularly for checkups and tests to see how your heart is doing. Your  doctor will also most likely recommend:              Lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, changing your diet, or increasing your physical activity          Medications such as aspirin, nitroglycerin tablets for angina,  medicines to lower your cholesterol or blood pressure, and medicines to  help reduce your heart's workload          That you participate in a cardiac rehabilitation programme.             Exercise is good for your heart muscle and overall health. It  can help you lose weight, keep your cholesterol and blood pressure  under control, reduce stress, and lift your mood. If you have angina after your heart attack, you will need to learn when to rest and when and how to take medicine for angina.               Returning to Usual Activities              After a heart attack, most people are able to return to their normal activities.  Ask your doctor when you should go back to :              Driving          Physical activity           Work          Sexual activity          Strenuous activities (running, heavy lifting, etc.)          Air travel.             Most people without chest pain following an uncomplicated heart attack  can safely return to most of their usual activities within a few weeks.  Most can begin walking immediately. Sexual activity with the usual  partner can also begin within a few weeks for most patients  without chest pain or other complications .              Driving can usually begin within a week for most patients  without chest pain or other complications  if allowed by state law. Each state has rules for driving a motor  vehicle following a serious illness. Patients with complications or  chest pain should not drive until their symptoms have been stable for a  few weeks.              Your doctor will tell you when you should return to each of these activities .              Anxiety and Depression After a Heart Attack               After a heart attack, many people worry about having another  heart attack. They often feel depressed and may have trouble adjusting  to a new lifestyle. You should discuss your feelings of anxiety or  depression with your doctor. Your doctor can give you medicine for  anxiety or depression, if needed. Spend time with family, friends, and  even pets. Affection can make you feel better and less lonely. Most  people do not continue to feel depressed after they have fully  recovered.              Know How and When to Seek Medical Attention              Having a heart attack increases your chances of having another  one. Therefore, it is very important that you and your family know how  and when to seek medical attention. Talk to your doctor about making an  emergency action plan , and talk with your family about it. The plan should include:               The signs and symptoms of a heart attack          Instructions for the prompt use of aspirin and nitroglycerin          How to access emergency medical services in your community          The location of the nearest hospital that offers 24-hour emergency heart care.             Many heart attack survivors also have  chest pain or angina .  The pain usually occurs after exertion and goes away in a few minutes  when you rest or take your angina medicine (nitroglycerin) as directed.  In a heart attack, the pain is usually more severe than angina, and it  does not go away when you rest or take your angina medicine.  If in doubt whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call the emergency services .              Unfortunately, most heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms begin before they seek medical help.  This delay can result in death or lasting heart damage .              Summary                        A heart attack occurs when the supply of blood and oxygen to an  area of heart muscle is blocked, usually by a blood clot. This may  cause the heart to stop beating and pumping blood effectively  (arrhythmia) and lead to death or permanent damage to the heart.          Each year, over a million people in the U.S. have a heart attack and about half of them die.  About one-half of those who die do so within 1 hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital .  Most of these sudden deaths (within 1 hour) are due to arrhythmias that  cause a severe decrease in the pumping function of the heart.          Signs of a heart attack include chest pain that may also  spread to the back, shoulders, arms, neck, or jaw. You may have other  symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or dizziness.  Symptoms vary, and some people have no symptoms.  Know the signs of a heart attack so you can act fast to get treatment .          Unfortunately, many heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more  after their symptoms begin before they seek medical help. This delay  can result in death or lasting heart damage.          The amount of damage from a heart attack depends on how much  of the heart is affected, how soon treatment begins, and other factors.           Both men and women have heart attacks.          Risk factors for heart disease and heart attack include those  that you cannot change, such as your age and a family history of early  heart disease. But there are also many things you can do to lower your  risk, such as not smoking, eating a diet low in fat and cholesterol,  and exercising regularly. It is also important to keep your weight,  cholesterol levels, and blood pressure under control.          Diagnosis and treatment of a heart attack can begin when  emergency medical personnel arrive after you call the emergency services. At the  hospital emergency room, doctors will work fast to find out if you are  having or have had a heart attack and give you treatment.          If you are having a heart attack, doctors will work quickly  to restore blood flow to the heart and continuously monitor vital signs  to detect and treat complications.          Long-term treatment after a heart attack may include cardiac  rehabilitation, checkups and tests, lifestyle changes, and medications.          After a heart attack, most people are able to return to their  normal activities. Ask your doctor when you should go back to driving,  physical activity, work, sexual activity, strenuous activities, and air  travel.           If you have had a heart attack, it is very important to have  an emergency action plan in case of another heart attack. Talk to your  doctor about your plan and make sure that your family members  understand it.          Remember, a heart attack is an emergency. Call the emergency services if  you think you (or someone else) may be having a heart attack.

[ 1 ]  In most cases it is painful, and thus is often referred to as a  sore throat . Inflammation of the tonsils ( tonsillitis ) and/or larynx ( laryngitis ) occur simultaneously, which can make eating difficult or painful. It can result in very large tonsils which cause trouble swallowing and breathing. Some are accompanied by a cough or fever.   Most cases are caused by  viral   infections  (40%-60%), with the remainder caused by  bacterial  infections,  fungal  infections, or irritants such as  pollutants  or  chemical substances . [ 2 ]   Treatment of viral causes are mainly symptomatic while bacterial or fungal causes may be amenable to antibiotics and antifungals respectively.

This is because viruses and bacteria often settle in this part of the body after a person inhales dust or water vapour containing the microorganism. Infection can also arise when a person touches their nose or mouth after having touched an object shared with another person with the disease. The foreign invader reproduces rapidly after settling on the body tissue.     [ edit ]   Viral pharyngitis   These comprise about 40-60% of all infectious cases and can be a feature of many different types of viral infections.     Adenovirus  - the most common of the viral causes. Typically the degree of neck  lymph node  enlargement is modest and the throat often does not appear red, although is very painful.   Orthomyxoviridae  which cause  influenza  - present with rapid onset high temperature, headache and generalised ache. A sore throat may be associated.   Infectious mononucleosis  (""glandular fever"") caused by the  Epstein-Barr virus . This may cause significant lymph gland swelling and an  exudative  tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The  heterophile test  can be used if this is suspected.   Herpes simplex virus  can cause multiple  mouth ulcers .   Measles   Common cold virus :  rhinovirus ,  coronavirus ,  respiratory syncytial virus ,  parainfluenza virus  can cause infection of the throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often extreme pain.   Primary  HIV       [ edit ]   Bacterial pharyngitis   A number of different bacteria can infect the human throat. The most common is  Group A streptococcus , however others include,  Corynebacterium diphtheriae ,  Neisseria gonorrhoeae ,  Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and  Mycoplasma pneumoniae . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Streptococcal pharyngitis   Main article:  Streptococcal pharyngitis   The most common bacterial agent is  streptococcus . It causes about 15-30% of cases of pharyngitis. [ 3 ]  Unlike adenovirus, there tends to be greater generalized symptoms and more signs to find. Typically enlarged and tender lymph glands, with bright red, inflamed, and swollen throat of sudden onset with severe pain (often the patient finds it painful to talk or swallow), the patient may have a high temperature, headache, and aching muscles ( myalgia ) and joints ( arthralgia ). White or yellow spots on the back of the throat may be present on exam. These spots may also appear on the tonsils when those glands are involved.   It may be impossible to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of sore throat. [ 4 ]   Coughing is usually absent in strep throat though a dry, nonproductive cough (similar to how a person clears his or her voice) may appear in some patients; in addition coughing may appear when there is co-infection with a virus. A stuffy nose is also considered uncommon and is more likely due to a virus instead of the strep bacteria.   Some immune-system meditated complications may occur:     Scarlet fever  with its vivid  rash , although the milder disease seen after the 1950s suggests that the bacteria may have mutated to less virulent illness and some doctors now call this  scarlatina  (literally a ""little scarlet fever"") [ citations needed ]   Historically the most important complication was of the generalized inflammatory disorder of  rheumatic fever  which could later result in  Rheumatic heart disease  affecting the valves of the heart. Antibiotics may reduce the incidence of this complication to under one-third.     [ 5 ] However the incidence of rheumatic fever in developed-regions of the world remains low even though the use of antibiotics has been declining. [ 6 ]   [ 7 ] This may be a result of a change in the prevalence of various strains of bacteria. In underdeveloped regions, untreated streptococcal infection can still give rise to rheumatic heart disease and may be due to environmental factors, or reflect a genetic predisposition of the patient to the disease.     Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis  is an inflammation of the kidney. It is disputed whether antibiotics might reduce [ 8 ]  the small risk of this or not. [ 5 ]   Very rarely there may occur a secondary infection behind the tonsils which may cause a life-threatening  septicaemia  ( Lemierre's syndrome ) [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Diphtheria   Diphtheria  is a potentially life threatening upper respiratory infection caused by  Corynebacterium diphtheriae  which has been largely eradicated in developed nations since the introduction of childhood  vaccination  programs, but is still reported in the  Third World  and increasingly in some areas in  Eastern Europe . Antibiotics are effective in the early stages, but recovery is generally slow.     [ edit ]   Other causes     [ edit ]   Candida albicans   Some cases of pharyngitis are caused by fungal infection such as Candida albicans causing  oral thrush .     [ edit ]   Fusobacterium necrophorum   Fusobacteria  are normal inhabitants of the oropharyngeal flora. After a strep sore throat has created a peritonsillar abscess, a crater filled with pus and bacteria near the tonsils,  Lemierre syndrome  can develop.     [ edit ]   Treatment   Treatment can be divided into symptomatic and remedial. Symptomatic treatments attempt to reduce pain and discomfort. Remedial treatments attempt to cure pharyngitis.   Remedial treatments are effective for bacterial infections and fungal infection. No specific treatment for viral infections have been found to be effective and most cases will settle within a few days.     [ edit ]   Symptomatic treatments     Analgesics such as  NSAIDs  and  acetaminophen  can help reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. [ 9 ]   Steroids: A single dose of  dexamethasone  reduces symptoms. This can either be given by mouth or intra-muscularly. [ 10 ]   Viscous lidocaine relieves pain by numbing the mucus membranes of the throat. [ 11 ]       [ edit ]   Remedial treatments     Antibiotics  are useful if a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For viral sore throats, antibiotics have no effect. These infections are treated by controlling or relieving symptoms until the virus runs its course. [ 5 ]   Antiviral drugs  do not decrease the length of illness and are not used except in cases when the patient's immune system is compromised. [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Alternative treatments   Many alternative treatments are promoted and used in sore throats. They are however poorly supported by evidence and  Uptodate  recommends that they not be used to treat pharyngitis. [ 12 ]  Some include  gargling  with a warm  salt  solution,  eucalyptus , and  chamomile .

The  oropharynx  is swollen and red.       ICD - 10   J 02. ,  J 31.2       ICD - 9   462 ,  472.1       DiseasesDB   24580       MedlinePlus   000655       eMedicine   emerg/419         MeSH   D010612       Pharyngitis  ( IPA :  [farndts] ) is an inflammation of the throat or  pharynx . [ 1 ]  In most cases it is painful, and thus is often referred to as a  sore throat . Inflammation of the tonsils ( tonsillitis ) and/or larynx ( laryngitis ) occur simultaneously, which can make eating difficult or painful. It can result in very large tonsils which cause trouble swallowing and breathing. Some are accompanied by a cough or fever.   Most cases are caused by  viral   infections  (40%-60%), with the remainder caused by  bacterial  infections,  fungal  infections, or irritants such as  pollutants  or  chemical substances . [ 2 ]   Treatment of viral causes are mainly symptomatic while bacterial or fungal causes may be amenable to antibiotics and antifungals respectively.

This is because viruses and bacteria often settle in this part of the body after a person inhales dust or water vapour containing the microorganism. Infection can also arise when a person touches their nose or mouth after having touched an object shared with another person with the disease. The foreign invader reproduces rapidly after settling on the body tissue.     [ edit ]   Viral pharyngitis   These comprise about 40-60% of all infectious cases and can be a feature of many different types of viral infections.     Adenovirus  - the most common of the viral causes. Typically the degree of neck  lymph node  enlargement is modest and the throat often does not appear red, although is very painful.   Orthomyxoviridae  which cause  influenza  - present with rapid onset high temperature, headache and generalised ache. A sore throat may be associated.   Infectious mononucleosis  (""glandular fever"") caused by the  Epstein-Barr virus . This may cause significant lymph gland swelling and an  exudative  tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The  heterophile test  can be used if this is suspected.   Herpes simplex virus  can cause multiple  mouth ulcers .   Measles   Common cold virus :  rhinovirus ,  coronavirus ,  respiratory syncytial virus ,  parainfluenza virus  can cause infection of the throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often extreme pain.   Primary  HIV       [ edit ]   Bacterial pharyngitis   A number of different bacteria can infect the human throat. The most common is  Group A streptococcus , however others include,  Corynebacterium diphtheriae ,  Neisseria gonorrhoeae ,  Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and  Mycoplasma pneumoniae . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Streptococcal pharyngitis   Main article:  Streptococcal pharyngitis   The most common bacterial agent is  streptococcus . It causes about 15-30% of cases of pharyngitis. [ 3 ]  Unlike adenovirus, there tends to be greater generalized symptoms and more signs to find. Typically enlarged and tender lymph glands, with bright red, inflamed, and swollen throat of sudden onset with severe pain (often the patient finds it painful to talk or swallow), the patient may have a high temperature, headache, and aching muscles ( myalgia ) and joints ( arthralgia ). White or yellow spots on the back of the throat may be present on exam. These spots may also appear on the tonsils when those glands are involved.   It may be impossible to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of sore throat. [ 4 ]   Coughing is usually absent in strep throat though a dry, nonproductive cough (similar to how a person clears his or her voice) may appear in some patients; in addition coughing may appear when there is co-infection with a virus. A stuffy nose is also considered uncommon and is more likely due to a virus instead of the strep bacteria.   Some immune-system meditated complications may occur:     Scarlet fever  with its vivid  rash , although the milder disease seen after the 1950s suggests that the bacteria may have mutated to less virulent illness and some doctors now call this  scarlatina  (literally a ""little scarlet fever"") [ citations needed ]   Historically the most important complication was of the generalized inflammatory disorder of  rheumatic fever  which could later result in  Rheumatic heart disease  affecting the valves of the heart. Antibiotics may reduce the incidence of this complication to under one-third.     [ 5 ] However the incidence of rheumatic fever in developed-regions of the world remains low even though the use of antibiotics has been declining. [ 6 ]   [ 7 ] This may be a result of a change in the prevalence of various strains of bacteria. In underdeveloped regions, untreated streptococcal infection can still give rise to rheumatic heart disease and may be due to environmental factors, or reflect a genetic predisposition of the patient to the disease.     Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis  is an inflammation of the kidney. It is disputed whether antibiotics might reduce [ 8 ]  the small risk of this or not. [ 5 ]   Very rarely there may occur a secondary infection behind the tonsils which may cause a life-threatening  septicaemia  ( Lemierre's syndrome ) [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Diphtheria   Diphtheria  is a potentially life threatening upper respiratory infection caused by  Corynebacterium diphtheriae  which has been largely eradicated in developed nations since the introduction of childhood  vaccination  programs, but is still reported in the  Third World  and increasingly in some areas in  Eastern Europe . Antibiotics are effective in the early stages, but recovery is generally slow.     [ edit ]   Other causes     [ edit ]   Candida albicans   Some cases of pharyngitis are caused by fungal infection such as Candida albicans causing  oral thrush .     [ edit ]   Fusobacterium necrophorum   Fusobacteria  are normal inhabitants of the oropharyngeal flora. After a strep sore throat has created a peritonsillar abscess, a crater filled with pus and bacteria near the tonsils,  Lemierre syndrome  can develop.     [ edit ]   Treatment   Treatment can be divided into symptomatic and remedial. Symptomatic treatments attempt to reduce pain and discomfort. Remedial treatments attempt to cure pharyngitis.   Remedial treatments are effective for bacterial infections and fungal infection. No specific treatment for viral infections have been found to be effective and most cases will settle within a few days.     [ edit ]   Symptomatic treatments     Analgesics such as  NSAIDs  and  acetaminophen  can help reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. [ 9 ]   Steroids: A single dose of  dexamethasone  reduces symptoms. This can either be given by mouth or intra-muscularly. [ 10 ]   Viscous lidocaine relieves pain by numbing the mucus membranes of the throat. [ 11 ]       [ edit ]   Remedial treatments     Antibiotics  are useful if a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For viral sore throats, antibiotics have no effect. These infections are treated by controlling or relieving symptoms until the virus runs its course. [ 5 ]   Antiviral drugs  do not decrease the length of illness and are not used except in cases when the patient's immune system is compromised. [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Alternative treatments   Many alternative treatments are promoted and used in sore throats. They are however poorly supported by evidence and  Uptodate  recommends that they not be used to treat pharyngitis. [ 12 ]  Some include  gargling  with a warm  salt  solution,  eucalyptus , and  chamomile .

Contents       1   Signs and symptoms   2   Diagnosis   3   Transmission   4   Treatment     4.1   Symptomatic therapies   4.2   Antibiotics       5   Complications   6   See also   7   References   8   External links               [ edit ]   Signs and symptoms   Streptococcal pharyngitis usually appears suddenly with a severe sore throat that may make talking or swallowing painful. In severe cases, breathing may be impaired.   Signs and symptoms may include:     Sudden and severe  sore throat   Inflamed  tonsils   Yellow and white patches in the throat   Difficulty swallowing   Tender  cervical   lymphadenopathy   Fever   Headache  (often prior to other symptoms)   General discomfort, feeling ill or uneasy   Halitosis   Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting   Rash [ 2 ]   Hives   Chills   Loss of appetite   Ear pain   Peeling of skin on hands and feet     Additional symptoms such as  sinusitis ,  vaginitis  or  impetigo  be present if the strep bacteria infects both the throat and a secondary location. For additional information on non-pharynx symptoms, see  Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Infection .     [ edit ]   Diagnosis   There are several causes for  pharyngitis , not just streptococcus bacteria. Productive coughing, nasal discharge, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat, though a co-infection with a virus is possible and may explain the presence of these additional symptoms. A  Rapid Strep Test  or a throat culture may be undertaken to help clarify diagnosis.   The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in  infectious mononucleosis  (glandular fever). [ 3 ]   A study of 729 patients with pharyngitis, in which 17% had a positive throat culture for group A streptococcus, identified the following four best predictors of streptococcus, also called the  Centor criteria : [ 4 ]     Lack of cough   Swollen and tender anterior  cervical lymph nodes   (Marked) tonsillar  exudates [ 5 ]   Fever             Number of symptoms   Probability of Strep       0   2.5%       1   6.0 - 6.9%       2   14.1  16.6%       3   30.1  34.1%       4   55.7%           Another study on 621 patients, assigned one point for each of the following symptoms: [ 6 ]     Temperature greater than 38 C   Absence of cough   Tender anterior cervical adenopathy   Tonsillar swelling or exudate   Age younger than 15   Subtracting a point for age older than 45.             Points   Probability of Strep   Management       1 or less   0%   Negative: No antibiotic       2   17%   Indeterminate: antibiotic based on throat culture       3   35%       4 or 5   51%   Positive: for throat culture and antibiotics            Finally, patients usually experience swelling of the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck, but swelling can also be located in the soft palate in the top of the mouth. The absence of tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar or pharyngeal exudates has been suggested as being the most useful finding in ruling out strep throat, with a negative likelihood of 0.74. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Transmission   Strep throat is caused by  Group A streptococcal infection  (GAS), [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  specifically the bacterium  Streptococcus pyogenes . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  It is spread by direct, close contact with an infected person via air-based germs. [ 16 ]  In addition, it may be spread through contamination of pillow cases, toys, toothbrushes and other often-used materials. [ 10 ]  Rarely, contaminated food, especially milk and milk products, can result in outbreaks. [ 17 ]   The  incubation period  for strep throat is thought to be between two to five days, but has been reported as long as eight days. [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment     [ edit ]   Symptomatic therapies   Nonprescription  over the counter drugs  of  ibuprofen  and  paracetamol  (acetaminophen) both help relieve throat pain and reduce fever by an average of 2.2F or 2.3F in children. [ 19 ]  Aspirin is not recommended for children due to the risk of  Reye's syndrome . In adults aspirin, paracetamol, or ibuprofen help reduce back pain by 48% and sore throat by 31%. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Antibiotics   Antibiotics will reduce symptoms slightly, as was the case in one study of 11 adult patients with sore throat and confirmed GAS infection. They were evaluated daily after the start of antibiotic treatment to register symptoms and signs and to measure body temperature. The mean reduction rate was great, but the greatest reduction was after 3 days. Out of all symptoms, reduction scores for muscle or joint pain was the most at 86%, and the lowest for sore throat at 67%. [ 21 ]  Treatment, which consists of penicillin (orally for 10 days or a single intramuscular injection of penicillin G), will also minimize transmission. This is why  GAS  positive children should not go back to school or day care until they have taken antibiotics for at least 48 hours. In one study the potential risk of transmission to close school contact was assessed by taking 47 children with positive throat cultures and randomly selecting them to receive penicillin V, penicillin G, or erythromycin. Throat cultures were then taken the morning after start of antibiotics and 17 (36.2%) had positive throat cultures. Cultures were taken again 24 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy, and only 12 (17%) of the patients still had positive throat cultures. [ 22 ]   Cephalosporins  (such as cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone) are recommended for penicillin-allergic patients. In another study, 41 patients with confirmed penicillin allergy were evaluated with cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxoneall cephalosporinsto see the allergic reaction. Skin tests with cephalosporins were clearly negative in 39 patients and all 41 patients tolerated the three cephalosporins administered. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]  Second-line antibiotics included amoxicillin, [ 25 ]  clindamycin, [ 26 ]  and oral cephalosporins which have a significantly better cure rate than penicillin. [ 27 ]   Studies have also shown that the broader-spectrum of antibiotics offer more effective short treatment courses than the traditional 10 days of Penicillin V, [ 28 ]  but noted that ""widespread use of broad-spectrum agents for a common infection is a significant concern in an age of increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance"". [ 29 ]  It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent rheumatic fever or an abscess on the tonsils. In one report of 500 patients, 30% had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, 0.2% had rheumatic fever and 0.2% had peritonsillar abscess (an abscess on the tonsils). [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Complications   The symptoms of strep throat usually improve even without treatment in five days, but the patient is contagious for several weeks. Lack of treatment or incomplete treatment of strep throat can lead to various complications. Some of them may pose serious health risks. Therefore, streptococcal tonsillitis is important to recognize and treat early. The patient is considered to be contagious up to three days after being treated with antibiotics. [ 30 ]   List of Complications arising from disseminated Streptococcal infection (originating in the throat) [ 31 ]     Scarlet Fever  : a red, raised skin rash caused by  toxins  released by the bacteria   Acute Rheumatic Fever  :  sore joints ,  heart disease ,  involuntary movements  and skin manifestations may occur   Streptococcal Toxic shock syndrome  : septic shock and multi-organ failure   Glomerulonephritis  : a form of  kidney failure  in which antibodies directed against the Streptococcus bacteria become lodged in the kidney, causing damage to the kidney itself   PANDAS Syndrome  : a neurological disorder which can result in permanent injury. Symptoms include  Obsessive-Compulsive  Type disorders and  involuntary movements   Herpes  may be aggravated post-infection     A skin disease known as  necrotizing fasciitis  may occur if Streptococcus bacteria infect a wound on the body, but this is not a complication of strep throat per se.

Signs and symptoms of a heart attack need to be            recognized. These help in quick medical attention, as well as saving            lives.             A common sign of an impending heart            attack is discomfort or slight pain. The discomfort occurs mostly in            the  chest  area. It is mild to start with and recurs at long intervals.            The feeling of discomfort can be a sense of pressure, dizziness,            squeezing of the chest and so on. Often this discomfort radiates to            other parts of the upper body, like the arms, neck, and back.                                                                                              This discomfort is typically combined            with breathlessness or difficulty breathing. Other symptoms of a heart            attack are headache, dizziness, nausea and excessive sweating.                                                                                                                                                                                         Tip!               Pending heart attack symptoms mask themselves as indigestion, being              overworked and tired all the time, and taking naps several times a              day.             On the other hand, there are forms of             heart attacks  that are silent. These project no symptoms whatsoever.            These happen to be even more dangerous and life-threatening than            painful heart attacks. It is common among diabetics to suffer from            silent heart attacks.             Sometimes, these symptoms are            mistaken and ignored as indigestion, heartburn, stress and so on. In            the best interests of health, it is better to pay attention to any            such feeling and consult doctors.             Symptoms are different in each            instance of a heart attack. However, the common  symptoms , if paid            attention to, will save many a life through early diagnosis and            treatment.             Annually, approximately 1 million            people in the United States suffer a heart attack. It is noteworthy            that more than half of these people die within an hour of the onset of            symptoms. Hence, the timely recognition of signs and emergency            hospitalization is necessary.

The  oropharynx  is swollen and red.

[ 1 ]  In most cases it is painful, and thus is often referred to as a  sore throat . Inflammation of the tonsils ( tonsillitis ) and/or larynx ( laryngitis ) occur simultaneously, which can make eating difficult or painful. It can result in very large tonsils which cause trouble swallowing and breathing. Some are accompanied by a cough or fever.   Most cases are caused by  viral   infections  (40%-60%), with the remainder caused by  bacterial  infections,  fungal  infections, or irritants such as  pollutants  or  chemical substances . [ 2 ]   Treatment of viral causes are mainly symptomatic while bacterial or fungal causes may be amenable to antibiotics and antifungals respectively.

This is because viruses and bacteria often settle in this part of the body after a person inhales dust or water vapour containing the microorganism. Infection can also arise when a person touches their nose or mouth after having touched an object shared with another person with the disease. The foreign invader reproduces rapidly after settling on the body tissue.     [ edit ]   Viral pharyngitis   These comprise about 40-60% of all infectious cases and can be a feature of many different types of viral infections.     Adenovirus  - the most common of the viral causes. Typically the degree of neck  lymph node  enlargement is modest and the throat often does not appear red, although is very painful.   Orthomyxoviridae  which cause  influenza  - present with rapid onset high temperature, headache and generalised ache. A sore throat may be associated.   Infectious mononucleosis  (""glandular fever"") caused by the  Epstein-Barr virus . This may cause significant lymph gland swelling and an  exudative  tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The  heterophile test  can be used if this is suspected.   Herpes simplex virus  can cause multiple  mouth ulcers .   Measles   Common cold virus :  rhinovirus ,  coronavirus ,  respiratory syncytial virus ,  parainfluenza virus  can cause infection of the throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often extreme pain.   Primary  HIV       [ edit ]   Bacterial pharyngitis   A number of different bacteria can infect the human throat. The most common is  Group A streptococcus , however others include,  Corynebacterium diphtheriae ,  Neisseria gonorrhoeae ,  Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and  Mycoplasma pneumoniae . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Streptococcal pharyngitis   Main article:  Streptococcal pharyngitis   The most common bacterial agent is  streptococcus . It causes about 15-30% of cases of pharyngitis. [ 3 ]  Unlike adenovirus, there tends to be greater generalized symptoms and more signs to find. Typically enlarged and tender lymph glands, with bright red, inflamed, and swollen throat of sudden onset with severe pain (often the patient finds it painful to talk or swallow), the patient may have a high temperature, headache, and aching muscles ( myalgia ) and joints ( arthralgia ). White or yellow spots on the back of the throat may be present on exam. These spots may also appear on the tonsils when those glands are involved.   It may be impossible to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of sore throat. [ 4 ]   Coughing is usually absent in strep throat though a dry, nonproductive cough (similar to how a person clears his or her voice) may appear in some patients; in addition coughing may appear when there is co-infection with a virus. A stuffy nose is also considered uncommon and is more likely due to a virus instead of the strep bacteria.   Some immune-system meditated complications may occur:     Scarlet fever  with its vivid  rash , although the milder disease seen after the 1950s suggests that the bacteria may have mutated to less virulent illness and some doctors now call this  scarlatina  (literally a ""little scarlet fever"") [ citations needed ]   Historically the most important complication was of the generalized inflammatory disorder of  rheumatic fever  which could later result in  Rheumatic heart disease  affecting the valves of the heart. Antibiotics may reduce the incidence of this complication to under one-third.     [ 5 ] However the incidence of rheumatic fever in developed-regions of the world remains low even though the use of antibiotics has been declining. [ 6 ]   [ 7 ] This may be a result of a change in the prevalence of various strains of bacteria. In underdeveloped regions, untreated streptococcal infection can still give rise to rheumatic heart disease and may be due to environmental factors, or reflect a genetic predisposition of the patient to the disease.     Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis  is an inflammation of the kidney. It is disputed whether antibiotics might reduce [ 8 ]  the small risk of this or not. [ 5 ]   Very rarely there may occur a secondary infection behind the tonsils which may cause a life-threatening  septicaemia  ( Lemierre's syndrome ) [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Diphtheria   Diphtheria  is a potentially life threatening upper respiratory infection caused by  Corynebacterium diphtheriae  which has been largely eradicated in developed nations since the introduction of childhood  vaccination  programs, but is still reported in the  Third World  and increasingly in some areas in  Eastern Europe . Antibiotics are effective in the early stages, but recovery is generally slow.     [ edit ]   Other causes     [ edit ]   Candida albicans   Some cases of pharyngitis are caused by fungal infection such as Candida albicans causing  oral thrush .     [ edit ]   Fusobacterium necrophorum   Fusobacteria  are normal inhabitants of the oropharyngeal flora. After a strep sore throat has created a peritonsillar abscess, a crater filled with pus and bacteria near the tonsils,  Lemierre syndrome  can develop.     [ edit ]   Treatment   Treatment can be divided into symptomatic and remedial. Symptomatic treatments attempt to reduce pain and discomfort. Remedial treatments attempt to cure pharyngitis.   Remedial treatments are effective for bacterial infections and fungal infection. No specific treatment for viral infections have been found to be effective and most cases will settle within a few days.     [ edit ]   Symptomatic treatments     Analgesics such as  NSAIDs  and  acetaminophen  can help reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. [ 9 ]   Steroids: A single dose of  dexamethasone  reduces symptoms. This can either be given by mouth or intra-muscularly. [ 10 ]   Viscous lidocaine relieves pain by numbing the mucus membranes of the throat. [ 11 ]       [ edit ]   Remedial treatments     Antibiotics  are useful if a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For viral sore throats, antibiotics have no effect. These infections are treated by controlling or relieving symptoms until the virus runs its course. [ 5 ]   Antiviral drugs  do not decrease the length of illness and are not used except in cases when the patient's immune system is compromised. [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Alternative treatments   Many alternative treatments are promoted and used in sore throats. They are however poorly supported by evidence and  Uptodate  recommends that they not be used to treat pharyngitis. [ 12 ]  Some include  gargling  with a warm  salt  solution,  eucalyptus , and  chamomile .

Contents       1   Signs and symptoms   2   Diagnosis   3   Transmission   4   Treatment     4.1   Symptomatic therapies   4.2   Antibiotics       5   Complications   6   See also   7   References   8   External links               [ edit ]   Signs and symptoms   Streptococcal pharyngitis usually appears suddenly with a severe sore throat that may make talking or swallowing painful. In severe cases, breathing may be impaired.   Signs and symptoms may include:     Sudden and severe  sore throat   Inflamed  tonsils   Yellow and white patches in the throat   Difficulty swallowing   Tender  cervical   lymphadenopathy   Fever   Headache  (often prior to other symptoms)   Malaise , general discomfort, feeling ill or uneasy   Halitosis   Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting   Rash [ 2 ]   Hives   Chills   Loss of appetite   Ear pain   Peeling of skin on hands and feet     Additional symptoms such as  sinusitis ,  vaginitis , or  impetigo  be present if the strep bacteria infects both the throat and a secondary location. For additional information on non-pharynx symptoms, see  Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Infection .     [ edit ]   Diagnosis   There are several causes for  pharyngitis , not just streptococcus bacteria. Productive coughing, nasal discharge, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat, though a co-infection with a virus is possible and may explain the presence of these additional symptoms. A  Rapid Strep Test  or a throat culture may be undertaken to help clarify diagnosis.   The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in  infectious mononucleosis  (glandular fever). [ 3 ]   A study of 729 patients with pharyngitis, in which 17% had a positive throat culture for group A streptococcus, identified the following four best predictors of streptococcus, also called the  Centor criteria : [ 4 ]     Lack of cough   Swollen and tender anterior  cervical lymph nodes   (Marked) tonsillar  exudates [ 5 ]   Fever             Number of symptoms   Probability of Strep       0   2.5%       1   6.0 - 6.9%       2   14.1  16.6%       3   30.1  34.1%       4   55.7%           Another study on 621 patients, assigned one point for each of the following symptoms: [ 6 ]     Temperature greater than 38C (100.4F)   Absence of cough   Tender anterior cervical adenopathy   Tonsillar swelling or exudate   Age younger than 15   Subtracting a point for age older than 45.             Points   Probability of Strep   Management       1 or less   0%   Negative: No antibiotic       2   17%   Indeterminate: antibiotic based on throat culture       3   35%       4 or 5   51%   Positive: for throat culture and antibiotics            Finally, patients usually experience swelling of the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck, but swelling can also be located in the soft palate in the top of the mouth. The absence of tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar or pharyngeal exudates has been suggested as being the most useful finding in ruling out strep throat, with a negative likelihood of 0.74. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Transmission   Strep throat is caused by  Group A streptococcal infection  (GAS), [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  specifically the bacterium  Streptococcus pyogenes . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  It is spread by direct, close contact with an infected person via air-borne germs. [ 16 ]  In addition, it may be spread through contamination of pillow cases, toys, toothbrushes and other often-used materials. [ 10 ]  Rarely, contaminated food, especially milk and milk products, can result in outbreaks. [ 17 ]   The  incubation period  for strep throat is thought to be between two to five days, but has been reported as long as eight days. [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment     [ edit ]   Symptomatic therapies   Nonprescription  over the counter drugs  of  ibuprofen  and  paracetamol  (acetaminophen) both help relieve throat pain and reduce fever by an average of 2.2F or 2.3F in children. [ 19 ]  Aspirin is not recommended for children due to the risk of  Reye's syndrome . In adults aspirin, paracetamol, or ibuprofen help reduce back pain by 48% and sore throat by 31%. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Antibiotics   Antibiotics will reduce symptoms slightly, as was the case in one study of 11 adult patients with sore throat and confirmed GAS infection. They were evaluated daily after the start of antibiotic treatment to register symptoms and signs and to measure body temperature. The mean reduction rate was great, but the greatest reduction was after 3 days. Out of all symptoms, reduction scores for muscle or joint pain was the most at 86%, and the lowest for sore throat at 67%. [ 21 ]  Treatment, which consists of penicillin (orally for 10 days or a single intramuscular injection of penicillin G), will also minimize transmission. This is why  GAS  positive children should not go back to school or day care until they have taken antibiotics for at least 48 hours. In one study the potential risk of transmission to close school contact was assessed by taking 47 children with positive throat cultures and randomly selecting them to receive penicillin V, penicillin G, or erythromycin. Throat cultures were then taken the morning after start of antibiotics and 17 (36.2%) had positive throat cultures. Cultures were taken again 24 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy, and only 12 (17%) of the patients still had positive throat cultures. [ 22 ]   Cephalosporins  (such as cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone) are recommended for penicillin-allergic patients. In another study, 41 patients with confirmed penicillin allergy were evaluated with cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxoneall cephalosporinsto see the allergic reaction. Skin tests with cephalosporins were clearly negative in 39 patients and all 41 patients tolerated the three cephalosporins administered. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]  Second-line antibiotics included amoxicillin, [ 25 ]  clindamycin, [ 26 ]  and oral cephalosporins which have a significantly better cure rate than penicillin. [ 27 ]   Studies have also shown that the broader-spectrum of antibiotics offer more effective short treatment courses than the traditional 10 days of Penicillin V, [ 28 ]  but noted that ""widespread use of broad-spectrum agents for a common infection is a significant concern in an age of increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance"". [ 29 ]  It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent rheumatic fever or an abscess on the tonsils. In one report of 500 patients, 30% had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, 0.2% had rheumatic fever and 0.2% had peritonsillar abscess (an abscess on the tonsils). [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Complications   The symptoms of strep throat usually improve even without treatment in five days, but the patient is contagious for several weeks. Lack of treatment or incomplete treatment of strep throat can lead to various complications. Some of them may pose serious health risks. Therefore, streptococcal tonsillitis is important to recognize and treat early. The patient is considered to be contagious up to three days after being treated with antibiotics.

The  oropharynx  is swollen and red.

[ 1 ]  In most cases it is painful, and thus is often referred to as a  sore throat . Inflammation of the tonsils ( tonsillitis ) and/or larynx ( laryngitis ) occur simultaneously, which can make eating difficult or painful. It can result in very large tonsils which cause trouble swallowing and breathing. Some are accompanied by a cough or fever.   Most cases are caused by  viral   infections  (40%-60%), with the remainder caused by  bacterial  infections,  fungal  infections, or irritants such as  pollutants  or  chemical substances . [ 2 ]   Treatment of viral causes are mainly symptomatic while bacterial or fungal causes may be amenable to antibiotics and antifungals respectively.

This is because viruses and bacteria often settle in this part of the body after a person inhales dust or water vapour containing the microorganism. Infection can also arise when a person touches their nose or mouth after having touched an object shared with another person with the disease. The foreign invader reproduces rapidly after settling on the body tissue.     [ edit ]   Viral pharyngitis   These comprise about 40-60% of all infectious cases and can be a feature of many different types of viral infections.     Adenovirus  - the most common of the viral causes. Typically the degree of neck  lymph node  enlargement is modest and the throat often does not appear red, although is very painful.   Orthomyxoviridae  which cause  influenza  - present with rapid onset high temperature, headache and generalised ache. A sore throat may be associated.   Infectious mononucleosis  (""glandular fever"") caused by the  Epstein-Barr virus . This may cause significant lymph gland swelling and an  exudative  tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The  heterophile test  can be used if this is suspected.   Herpes simplex virus  can cause multiple  mouth ulcers .   Measles   Common cold virus :  rhinovirus ,  coronavirus ,  respiratory syncytial virus ,  parainfluenza virus  can cause infection of the throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often extreme pain.   Primary  HIV       [ edit ]   Bacterial pharyngitis   A number of different bacteria can infect the human throat. The most common is  Group A streptococcus , however others include,  Corynebacterium diphtheriae ,  Neisseria gonorrhoeae ,  Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and  Mycoplasma pneumoniae . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Streptococcal pharyngitis   Main article:  Streptococcal pharyngitis   The most common bacterial agent is  streptococcus . It causes about 15-30% of cases of pharyngitis. [ 3 ]  Unlike adenovirus, there tends to be greater generalized symptoms and more signs to find. Typically enlarged and tender lymph glands, with bright red, inflamed, and swollen throat of sudden onset with severe pain (often the patient finds it painful to talk or swallow), the patient may have a high temperature, headache, and aching muscles ( myalgia ) and joints ( arthralgia ). White or yellow spots on the back of the throat may be present on exam. These spots may also appear on the tonsils when those glands are involved.   It may be impossible to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of sore throat. [ 4 ]   Coughing is usually absent in strep throat though a dry, nonproductive cough (similar to how a person clears his or her voice) may appear in some patients; in addition coughing may appear when there is co-infection with a virus. A stuffy nose is also considered uncommon and is more likely due to a virus instead of the strep bacteria.   Some immune-system meditated complications may occur:     Scarlet fever  with its vivid  rash , although the milder disease seen after the 1950s suggests that the bacteria may have mutated to less virulent illness and some doctors now call this  scarlatina  (literally a ""little scarlet fever"") [ citations needed ]   Historically the most important complication was of the generalized inflammatory disorder of  rheumatic fever  which could later result in  Rheumatic heart disease  affecting the valves of the heart. Antibiotics may reduce the incidence of this complication to under one-third.     [ 5 ] However the incidence of rheumatic fever in developed-regions of the world remains low even though the use of antibiotics has been declining. [ 6 ]   [ 7 ] This may be a result of a change in the prevalence of various strains of bacteria. In underdeveloped regions, untreated streptococcal infection can still give rise to rheumatic heart disease and may be due to environmental factors, or reflect a genetic predisposition of the patient to the disease.     Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis  is an inflammation of the kidney. It is disputed whether antibiotics might reduce [ 8 ]  the small risk of this or not. [ 5 ]   Very rarely there may occur a secondary infection behind the tonsils which may cause a life-threatening  septicaemia  ( Lemierre's syndrome ) [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Diphtheria   Diphtheria  is a potentially life threatening upper respiratory infection caused by  Corynebacterium diphtheriae  which has been largely eradicated in developed nations since the introduction of childhood  vaccination  programs, but is still reported in the  Third World  and increasingly in some areas in  Eastern Europe . Antibiotics are effective in the early stages, but recovery is generally slow.     [ edit ]   Other causes     [ edit ]   Candida albicans   Some cases of pharyngitis are caused by fungal infection such as Candida albicans causing  oral thrush .     [ edit ]   Fusobacterium necrophorum   Fusobacteria  are normal inhabitants of the oropharyngeal flora. After a strep sore throat has created a peritonsillar abscess, a crater filled with pus and bacteria near the tonsils,  Lemierre syndrome  can develop.     [ edit ]   Treatment   Treatment can be divided into symptomatic and remedial. Symptomatic treatments attempt to reduce pain and discomfort. Remedial treatments attempt to cure pharyngitis.   Remedial treatments are effective for bacterial infections and fungal infection. No specific treatment for viral infections have been found to be effective and most cases will settle within a few days.     [ edit ]   Symptomatic treatments     Analgesics such as  NSAIDs  and  acetaminophen  can help reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. [ 9 ]   Steroids: A single dose of  dexamethasone  reduces symptoms. This can either be given by mouth or intra-muscularly. [ 10 ]   Viscous lidocaine relieves pain by numbing the mucus membranes of the throat. [ 11 ]       [ edit ]   Remedial treatments     Antibiotics  are useful if a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For viral sore throats, antibiotics have no effect. These infections are treated by controlling or relieving symptoms until the virus runs its course. [ 5 ]   Antiviral drugs  do not decrease the length of illness and are not used except in cases when the patient's immune system is compromised. [ citation needed ]       [ edit ]   Alternative treatments   Many alternative treatments are promoted and used in sore throats. They are however poorly supported by evidence and  Uptodate  recommends that they not be used to treat pharyngitis. [ 12 ]  Some include  gargling  with a warm  salt  solution,  eucalyptus , and  chamomile .

It slowly grows under the skin in the subcutaneous tissue. A person may have a single lipoma or may have many lipomas. They are the most common benign mesenchymal tumor. Lipomas are found in the subcutaneous tissues and, less commonly, in internal organs. They usually present with little difficulty in diagnosis or morbidity. Lipomas typically develop as discrete rubbery masses in the subcutaneous tissues of the trunk and proximal extremity. They usually are a few centimeters in size and can be removed by surgical excision or liposuction. Lipoma is commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age but can also be found in children. 1/1000 of the general population has a lipoma. Lipomas are found most often on the torso, neck, upper thighs, upper arms, and armpits, but can occur almost anywhere in the body. One or more lipomas may be present at the same time. Lipomas are the most common noncancerous soft tissue growth. Types of lipomas include the superficial subcutaneous lipoma, the intramuscular lipoma, the spindle cell lipoma, the angiolipoma, the benign lipoblastoma, and the lipomas of tendon sheaths, nerves, synovium, periosteum, and the lumbosacral area.          Lipoma is a common soft-tissue tumor found under the skin but also can appear in deeper tissues and even in various body organs, such as the heart, brain, and lung. Lipomas range in firmness, some feeling rather hard. The skin over the lipoma has a normal appearance. Lipomas rarely grow more than 2 or 3 inches across. They can develop anywhere on the body but are particularly common on the forearms, torso, and back of the neck. Some people have only one, whereas others develop many lipomas. Lipomas rarely cause problems, although they may occasionally be painful if they grow against a nerve .Usually, a doctor can easily recognize lipomas, and no tests are required for diagnosis. Lipomas are not a form of cancer, and they rarely become cancerous. If a lipoma begins to change in any way, a doctor may perform a biopsy. Treatment usually is not required, but bothersome lipomas may be removed by surgery or by liposuction.          Causes of Lipomas          The cause of lipomas is unknown. Sometimes lipomas are detected after an injury. But it's uncertain whether they're caused by the trauma or whether their detection was just incidental. Lipomas also tend to run in families, so genetic factors likely play a role in their development.                    Surgery involving the urethra          Lipomas also tend to run in families, so genetic factors likely play a role in their development          It is possible there may be genetic involvement as many patients with lipomas come from a family with a history of these tumours.          Side effect of certain medications, including some psychiatric drugs and medications used to treat high blood pressure and prostate enlargement                  Symptoms of Lipomas          Signs and symptoms of Lipomas may include :                    Lump under the skin.          Arm lump.          Skin lump.          Soft painless lump.                  Treatment of Lipomas                    Medical therapy includes endoscopic excision of tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract (ie, esophagus, stomach, duodenum) or the colon.          Treatment for lipomas may not be required, however in most cases they can be surgically removed if they are very large, painful, or cosmetically unattractive.          This treatment shrinks the lipoma but usually doesn't completely eliminate the tumor. Steroid injections are typically used with smaller tumors those less than 2.5 centimeters in diameter .          Larger lipomas are best removed by surgically cutting them out. Recurrences after removal are uncommon.                                                                                                                                          Our Most Popular Section                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Venous Angioma   Homemade pH Balancer   Cellulite   Eyebrow Trimming   Forever Free Wrinkle   Seasonal Skin Care   Shiny Hair   Pimples Blackhead Treatment                                                                                                                                    Malignant Melanoma   Koilonychia   Kid Hairstyle   Treating Lentigines   Onychorrhexis   Congenital Nevi   Nail Patella Syndrome   Nads Hair Removal                                                                                                                                    Hodgkins Disease   Chalazion   Fennel Essential Oil   Cellulite   Fight Cellulite   Greying Hair   Electrolysis Treatment   Onychorrhexis                                                                                                                                    Hair Styles Tips   Dermoid Cyst   Choosing a Hair Colour   Mask Application Tips   Hair Washing Tips   Colored Lip Gloss   Homemade Hand Lotion   Fashion Mistakes                                                                                                                                                                                              Home  |  Skin Care  |  Hair Care  |  Home Remedies  |  Skin Disorders  |  Aromatherapy  |  MakeUp  |  Body Care   |  Health Care  |  Eye Care  |  Fitness  |  Eyebrows  |  Beauty Articles  |  Celebrity Hair Styles  |  Hair Loss  |  Cellulite  |  Rosacea  |  Skin Infection  |  Skin Tumour  |  Hair Styles Tips  |  Aloe Vera  |  Plastic Surgery  |  Contact Us  |  About Us  |  Site Map  |  Resourses  |  Disclaimer  |  Advertise with us  |  Beauty Blog                 Copyright ©2004, CosmeticsDiary.com (All Rights Reserved)   Acne - Acne information, picture, symptom, cause of Acne

Not all heart attacks begin with sudden, crushing chest            pain, the way they are so often shown in the movies and on TV.            Instead, the most common warning signal are:                                                                                     KNOW THE SYMPTOMS OF            HEART DISEASE.                                                           Pain of discomfort in the center of            the  chest  that lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes            back.               Pain that spreads from the chest to the              arm , neck, or jaw.                            Chest discomfort with sweating, shortness of breath, tiredness, or              upset stomach. These last three symptoms are particularly common in              women.                              Immediate Self-Help             If you experience             heart attack            symptoms  and are taking nitroglycerin medication, take one            nitroglycerin tablet as soon as you feel discomfort, a second tablet            if the discomfort does not go away in 5 minutes, and a third tablet            after 5 more minutes if you are still experiencing symptoms.            FLU SYMPTOMS             |              VASECTOMY REVERSAL             In addition, you should chew one            adult-strength (325 mg) uncoated aspirin. Whether or not you have been            prescribed nitroglycerin, you should take one aspirin. If the symptoms            stop, call your doctor immediately for further advice. If symptoms            continue, dial 9-1-1.             Getting Emergency Care -- A Must             If the above medications do not            relieve your discomfort within 15 minutes, get to the hospital fast.            Be sure you know the phone number to call for emergency            transportation. This is the best way to get to the hospital if you            could be having a heart attack. In many areas, the emergency number            will be 9-1-1; in other areas, it will be a 7-digit emergency number.            (For more information on what to do in case of a heart attack, see            ""Steps for Survival"")             Medical science now offers treatments            that can stop heart attacks in their tracks if the treatments are            given very quickly after the attack begins. These new treatments            include ""clot-dissolving"" drugs or coronary angioplasty (aslo called            balloon angioplasty) to reopen the clogged blood vessel that has cut            off the oxygen supply to the  heart . These treatments save lives and            reduce damage to the heart muscle -- but only if they are given            immediately.             New research shows that            clot-dissolving medicine also can be used to treat a stroke. But once            again, it must be used quickly in order to be effective. That means if            you have stroke symptoms, you should get emergency help immediately.                        W arning signs for stroke include weakness or numbness in the face,            arm, hand, leg, or foot; sudden blurred vision; difficulty speaking;            and sudden dizziness or loss of coordination.
