Located in the heart of Bluegrass Country the Churchill Downs is home to the world renowned Kentucky Derby. The late Barbaro is the defending champion of the Kentucky Derby. Louisville Kentucky is a who’s who in May during the Derby. The likes of Kid Rock, Pamela Anderson, Michael Jordan and many other celebrities can be seen in premier seating. Because of standing room only admissions during the Kentucky Derby, crowds bypass the 51,000 seating capacity to a whopping 140,000 spectators.     The Churchill Downs hosted the Breeder’s Cup on six occasions. Invasor took the victory in the most recent running of the Breeder’s Cup at Churchill Downs in 2006. Indulge in one of five fine dining areas near every seat throughout Churchill Downs. Great seating is also attainable during other premier events throughout the year. When you catch sight of the twin spires atop the grandstand seats you know you are about to witness the best that thoroughbred racing has to offer. If you are lucky enough to attend the Derby, take a seat and a deep breath and you may actually witness the next Triple Crown winner.

The Derby is on Saturday May 2, 2009! Where is the Kentucky Derby?  The Derby is raced at Churchill Downs Racecourse in Louisville, Kentucky Where can I watch the Kentucky Derby?  Watch the Kentucky Derby live on TV with NBC at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time The Kentucky Derby is a stakes race for three-year-old thoroughbred horses, staged yearly in Louisville, Kentucky on the first Saturday in May, capping the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival. The race currently covers one and one-quarter miles (2.012 km) at Churchill Downs ; colts and geldings carry 126 pounds (57 kg), fillies 121 pounds (55 kg). The race, known as ""The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports"" for its approximate time length, is the first leg of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing in the United States. It typically draws around 155,000 fans.The Kentucky Derby is one of the crown jewels of the elusive Triple Crown which includes the Belmont Stakes and the Preakness Stakes . Horse racing in Kentucky is rich in history, dating back to 1789 when the first race course was laid out in Lexington. However, it was almost 100 years later, in 1875, that Churchill Downs officially opened and began its tradition as ""Home of the Kentucky Derby.""  In 1787, The Commons, a park-like block near Lexington's Race Street was used by horsemen for racing. By 1789, complaints by ""safety minded"" citizens led to the formal development of a race meet at The Commons. The men who organized this race meet, including Kentucky Statesman Henry Clay, also formed the Commonwealth's first Jockey Club. The organization later was named the Kentucky Jockey Club in 1809.  Racing in Louisville dates back to 1783 when local sources reported that races were held on Market Street in the downtown area. To alleviate the problems associated with racing on the busy city thoroughfare, a course was developed at the now abandoned Shippingport Island in 1805. Racing was conducted on the island in the Ohio River at what was called the Elm Tree Gardens. By 1827, a new track, known as the Hope Distillery Course, was laid out on what is presently Main and 16th Streets. Racing was also held on a number of private tracks located on farms throughout the local area. One of the more prominent of these was Peter Funk's Beargrass Track which was located in an area now bordered by Hurstbourne Lane and Taylorsville Road.  The Oakland Race Course was opened in the fall of 1833 and brought racing back to a formal site with the track, complete with clubhouse, located at what is now Seventh and Magnolia Streets in ""Old Louisville"". This was followed in 1858 by the opening of the Woodlawn Course on the Louisville and Lexington railroad lines just outside of today's St. Matthews, east of Louisville. The site closed in 1870, but the Woodlawn Vase, the track's premier trophy, has been used in the presentation to the winner of the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico since 1917.  Harness racing was also a significant part of Louisville's early racing history with a number of tracks in existence. One of the most prominent was Greeneland, a racecourse for trotters was built just east of Churchill Downs in 1868.

Mint Juleps  The Kentucky Oaks  - The 134rd running Kentucky Derby  -A great resource for Derby Information The Founding of Churchill Downs  While traveling in England and France in 1872-1873, 26-year-old Col. M. Lewis Clark, devised the idea of a Louisville Jockey Club for conducting race meets. Clark toured and visited with a number of prominent racing leaders, including England's Admiral Rous and France's Vicompte Darn, vice president of the French Jockey Club. Upon his return from Europe, Clark began development of his racetrack which would serve to showcase the Kentucky breeding industry. The track would eventually become known as ""Churchill Downs."" The first reference of the name Churchill Downs came in an 1883 Kentucky Derby article reported by the former Louisville Commercial.  ""The crowd in the grand stand sent out a volume of voice, and the crowd in the field took it up and carried it from boundary to boundary of Churchill Downs.""  The track was incorporated as Churchill Downs in 1937.  The first public notice of establishment of the track was reported in the May 27, 1874 edition of the Courier-Journal. The notice was met with some objections because another track had already been proposed by the Falls City Racing Association for a site near the river just east of downtown Louisville. Clark and a group of prominent Louisville gentlemen met at the Galt House on June 18, 1874 to prepare articles of incorporation with the actual filing for the Louisville Jockey Club and Driving Park Association taking place on June 20.  To fund the construction of the track, Clark raised $32,000 by selling 320 membership subscriptions to the track at $100 each. Eighty acres of land, approximately three miles south of downtown were leased from Clark's uncles, John and Henry Churchill. A clubhouse, grandstand, porter's lodge and six stables were all eventually constructed on the site for the opening of the track.  For his inaugural race meet, Clark designed his three major stakes races, the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Oaks and Clark Handicap, after the three premier races in England, the Epsom Derby, Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes, respectively. These events have each been held continuously at Churchill since their debut in 1875. However, in 1953, the Clark was moved from the spring to the fall meet. The Falls City was also offered during the inaugural meet and after four interruptions, the race continues to be held.  The track formally opened May 17, 1875 with four races scheduled. The winner of the first race was Bonaventure, however the winner of the day's featured race, the Kentucky Derby, was a three-year-old chestnut colt, Aristides. Owned by H.P. McGrath, Aristides was trained by and ridden by two African-Americans, Ansel Williamson and Oliver Lewis, respectively.  Despite the success of the first Kentucky Derby, the track was not financially successful and on November 24, 1894 the New Louisville Jockey Club was incorporated. William F. Schulte was appointed president and Clark was retained as presiding judge for the track.  Under Schulte, a new grandstand was constructed during fall 1894 - spring 1895 on the opposite side of the track for a reported cost of $100,000. The grandstand was complemented by two spires constructed atop the roof. The twin spires, a simple architectural element, would become the symbol of Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Derby.  1874 -- Col. M. Lewis Clark begins rescue of Kentucky's declining stock farm. Develops Louisville Jockey Club on land secured from his uncles John and Henry Churchill.  At the turn of the century, financial problems plagued the racetrack. On October 1, 1902 a group headed by former Louisville Mayor Charles Grainger, Charlie Price and Matt J. Winn agreed to takeover the operation. The takeover was done by amending the track's articles of incorporation with no transfer in the form of a deed. Grainger was named president, Price racing secretary and Winn vice president.  Under this administration, the track finally showed its first profit in 1903, 28 years after its founding. As the Kentucky Derby grew in popularity so did the racetrack. In 1907 the owners of Churchill Downs, who were officials of the New Louisville Jockey Club, joined with nearby Douglas Park to form the Louisville Racing Association. The purpose of the new Association was to establish race dates and policies for racing in the City. This relationship led to the formation of the Kentucky Jockey Club in February 1919 as a holding company for Churchill and three other tracks in the State: Latonia in the north, Lexington in the bluegrass region, and Douglas Park and Churchill Downs in Louisville.  Under the powerful Kentucky Jockey Club, the track's domain grew between 1919-1929. During this time the company acquired possession of the newly built Fairmount Park in East St. Louis, IL in 1925 and also constructed Lincoln Fields in Crete, IL in 1926. With five tracks under its control, the Kentucky Jockey Club began the process of dissolving the organization in December 1927 for the purpose of reorganizing as a separate holding corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware. According to a Louisville Times article dated December 29, 1927 . . .""incorporated under the laws of Delaware, provides for a capitalization of $6,000,000, an increase of $2,600,000 over the present capitalization.""  The process was finalized on January 16, 1928 with the American Turf Association serving as the new holding company for Churchill Downs, Douglas Park, Lexington, and Latonia in Kentucky and Fairmount Park, Lincoln Fields and Washington Park in Illinois. Washington Park was purchased by the association during this period.  The Fairmount Park track was sold in 1929, and in 1935, the association began to dramatically trim its holdings with the sale of Washington Park, the closing and eventual sale of Lexington, and the end of racing at Douglas Park. The reduction left the association with three tracks: Churchill Downs, Latonia and Lincoln Fields. Due to economic reasons Churchill Downs and Latonia formed a separate operating corporation titled, Churchill Downs-Latonia Incorporated on January 28, 1937. Lincoln Fields was operated by Lincoln Fields Jockey Club, Inc., but all three tracks were still owned by the parent corporation, American Turf Association.  On January 13, 1942, officials of Churchill Downs-Latonia Inc. sold the Latonia track and abandoned racing at the site. Later that year on April 24, the Churchill Downs-Latonia Incorporated's name was officially changed to Churchill Downs Incorporated. The American Turf Association continued its affiliation with Churchill, but sold its last out-of-state holding, Lincoln Fields, in March 1947.  The corporate direction of Churchill Downs became a key topic in November 1948. Backed by track President Matt Winn (1938-49) and other board members, a committee was created to study the feasibility of the creation of a foundation to purchase Churchill and operate the track as a nonprofit entity with its earnings donated to the University of Louisville School of Medicine.  The proposal was founded upon the experience of the Churchill Downs Foundation, a charitable organization led by J. Graham Brown. Each fall, several days of racing were held for charitable purposes. During a 10-year period 1940-50s, the foundation donated approximately $1.5 million to charity.  The proposal was considered up until the death of Winn on October 6, 1949. Following the naming of William Veeneman as chairman and chief executive officer of both Churchill Downs and the American Turf Association on Oct. 10, and the selection of Bill Corum as track president, the proposal was permanently shelved December 30, 1949.  The end of the once mighty American Turf Association came April 3, 1950 as stockholders voted to dissolve the association. Shareholders of the association exchanged their shares on a one for one basis for Churchill Downs Incorporated stock.  Under the direction of Bill Corum, a former New York Times and New York Journal-American sports columnist, Churchill Downs and the famed Kentucky Derby continued to grow and modernize: the first national telecast of the Kentucky Derby aired May 3, 1952 the first barns constructed of concrete firewalls were built in 1952 more seating boxes were added to the second floor of the grandstand and clubhouse in 1953 with 400 additional third-floor boxes in the clubhouse film patrol was installed in 1954 to provide replays to the racing officials in 1955 a $300,000 automatic sprinkler system was installed in the entire grandstand and clubhouse.  Following Corum's death in December 1958, Wathen Knebelkamp was selected as his successor on March 3, 1959. Under his direction an aggressive building and renovation program was initiated. During Knebelkamp's tenure improvements rose from $128,000 in 1959 to $1,016,000 in 1966. Renovations ranged from the installation of 1,000 seats on the north end of the grandstand (and construction of a museum in 1960) to the addition of the fourth and fifth floors of the Skye Terrace ""Millionaire's Row"" in 1965-66.  The success of the track continued under Knebelkamp, but Churchill's eighth president was faced with speculation that the track was a prime target for a hostile takeover. In January,1960 a proposal was made to have the City of Louisville issue revenue bonds to purchase Churchill Downs. However, the proposal, which was made in an effort to secure the Derby and prevent outside ownership of the track, was turned down by aldermen. In December 1963, the Kentucky Racing Commission set forth a proposal to establish a new organization to purchase Churchill and Lexington's Keeneland Race Course and to modernize both tracks through revenue bonds.  Finally, in March 1969, as a counter to a stock takeover attempt by National Industries, a group of Churchill board members, headed by John Galbreath, Warner L. Jones, Jr. and Arthur ""Bull"" Hancock formed what was called the ""Derby Protection Group."" They successfully outbid National Industries for control of the Company, moving the stock from $22 a share to $35.  Lynn Stone became Churchill Downs ninth president as he replaced the retiring Knebelkamp in December 1969. Stone had come to Churchill in 1961 as resident manager and was appointed vice president and general manager in 1966.  Under Stone's leadership: the Derby celebrated its 100th running in 1974, with a record 163,628 on hand; added the Skye Terrace's sixth floor in 1977 for $1.8 million; computerized the pari-mutuel system in 1982; and began development of a $7 million Kentucky Derby Museum.  As president, Lynn Stone headed the efforts that ended two separate takeover attempts by Brownell Combs II of Spendthrift Farm and Irwin L. Jacobs, respectively in 1984. In August 1984, Stone resigned, following huge financial losses that resulted from two years of failed summer racing. Stone was replaced by acting President Thomas H. Meeker, a former general counsel to Churchill Downs while with the law firm of Wyatt, Tarrant and Combs. In September 1984, Meeker was named permanently to the position.  At 40, Meeker became the youngest president since Meriwether Lewis Clark organized the track at age 29. Meeker immediately began a five-year, $25 million renovation renaissance, headed by: (dollar figures in millions) $2.5 core renovations (1984) $3.2 Matt Winn Turf Course (1985) $2.5 paddock construction (1986) $5 clubhouse improvements (1987) $3.7 Skye Terrace updating (1988) $1.2 barn area improvements (1989).  These renovations led to a resurgence of the track and helped attract the Breeders' Cup Championship. Churchill Downs has responded by successfully hosting four of the top five attendance totals for the event: a record 80,452 in 1998; 71,671 in 1994, second; 71,237 in 1988, third; and 66,204 in 1991, fifth.  Under Meeker's leadership, and through the direction of former Chairman Warner L. Jones, Jr., 1984 to 1992, and current Chairman William S. Farish, the track has experienced impressive growth in all areas.  Combined Kentucky Derby Day wagering, on-track and national, has increased from $26,805,205 in 1985 to $88,941,006 in 1998. Churchill Downs has become a leader in simulcast wagering as both a host site and receiver. As a receiver, the $15 million Sports Spectrum, a state-of-the-art wagering center located seven miles from the track and constructed in 1992, has proved a national leader. The success in these areas has helped fuel Churchill Downs horsemen's purses, which have risen from a daily average of $187,363 during the 1990 Spring Meet to a record $469,643 during the 1999 season. Fall Meet purses have also grown to a daily average of $378,058.  A key to the future success of Churchill Downs Incorporated rests upon the Company's potential for development and expansion. Headed by its most aggressive development effort since the days of the American Turf Association in the 1920s-1930s, the Churchill Downs Management Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Churchill Downs Incorporated, opened Hoosier Park at Anderson in September 1994. The dual Standardbred and Thoroughbred track, located in Anderson, Ind., approximately 40 miles northeast of Indianapolis, serves as Indiana's first pari-mutuel racetrack and Churchill's first out-of-state racing site since 1937. Under the Hoosier Park license, the Company also operates off-track betting facilities in Merrillville, Fort Wayne and Indianapolis, Ind.  In December 1997, Churchill Downs Incorporated formed the wholly owned subsidiary Churchill Downs Investment Company (CDIC), which oversees the Company's industry-related investments. In recent years, the Company has continued its aggressive growth cycle. In April 1998, the Company finalized the purchase of Ellis Park in Henderson, Ky., and Kentucky Horse Center in Lexington, Ky., for $22 million. In January 1999, the Company purchased a majority interest in Charlson Broadcast Technologies, LLC. The venture was developed as a means to provide simulcast graphic software and video services to racetracks and off-track betting facilities.  In April 1999, the Company completed a $86 million purchase of Calder Race Course in Miami. The acquisition of Hollywood Park followed in September 1999. In 2000, Churchill Downs Incorporated completed the acquisition of Arlington International outside of Chicago, adding another entity to the Churchill Downs Incorporated network of racetracks.  Churchill Downs Incorporated's success has been achieved through a corporate strategy based on strengthening its racing program and the Kentucky Derby, increasing the track's share of the national simulcast market, and the geographic expansion of its racing operations. This commitment to quality racing has made the Company one of the premier racing centers in North America.

It was founded by  Scott Rasmussen  and his father Bill Rasmussen and launched on September 7, 1979, under the direction of Chet Simmons, who was the network's first President and CEO (and later became the  United States Football League 's first commissioner). Getty Oil Company provided the funding to begin the new venture.  George Bodenheimer  is ESPN's current president, a position he has held since November 19, 1998; since March 3, 2003, he has been the head of ABC Sports as well, which has since been rebranded as  ESPN on ABC  (though ABC Sports still legally has a separate existence).   ESPN's signature telecast,  SportsCenter , debuted with the network and aired its 30,000th episode on February 11, 2007. ESPN broadcasts primarily out of its studios in  Bristol, Connecticut ; it also operates offices out of  New York City ;  Seattle, Washington ;  Charlotte, North Carolina  and  Los Angeles, California ; the Los Angeles office is scheduled to open at  L.A. Live  in 2009. The name of the sport company was lengthened to ""ESPN Inc."" in February 1985.   ESPN markets itself as ""The Worldwide Leader in Sports"", a slogan that appears on nearly all company media but whose origin is unknown.   Most programming on ESPN and its affiliated networks is composed of live or tape-delayed sporting events and sports-related news programming (such as  SportsCenter ) with the remainder filled by sports-related talk shows (such as  Around the Horn ,  Jim Rome is Burning ,  Outside the Lines , and  PTI ) and sports-related documentaries.

In the mid-1970s, Rasmussen worked for the  World Hockey Association 's  New England Whalers , selling commercial time for their broadcasts. His son Scott, a former high school goaltender, was the team's  public-address announcer . Both were fired in 1977 and Rasmussen sought a new business venture. His original idea was a  cable television  network (then a fairly new medium) that focused on covering sports events in the state of  Connecticut  (for example, the  Hartford Whalers , Bristol Red Sox, and the  Connecticut Huskies ). When Rasmussen was told that buying a continuous 24-hour satellite feed was less expensive than buying several blocks of only a few hours a night, he expanded to a 24-hour nationwide network. The channel's original name was ESP, for Entertainment and Sports Programming, but it was changed prior to launch. [ 1 ]   ESPN started with the debut of  SportsCenter  hosted by  Lee Leonard  and  George Grande  on September 7, 1979. Afterwards was a pro slow pitch softball game. The first score on  SportsCenter  was from women's  tennis  on the final weekend of the  US Open .   To help fill 24 hours a day of air time, ESPN aired a wide variety of sports events that broadcast networks did not show on weekends, including  Australian Rules Football ,  Davis Cup tennis ,  professional wrestling ,  boxing , and additional  college football  and  basketball  games. The U.S. Olympic Festival, the now-defunct competition that was organized as a training tool by the  United States Olympic Committee , was also an ESPN staple during this time.     [ edit ]   Professional sports arrive   ESPN (along with the  USA Network ) was among the earliest cable-based broadcast partners for the  National Basketball Association  (NBA). Lasting from 198284, the network's relationship with the association marked its initial foray into the American professional sports sector. After an eighteen-year hiatus, ESPN (by then, under the auspices of the  ABC  network), secured a $2.4 billion/six-year broadcast contract with the NBA, thereby revitalizing its historic compact with U.S.  professional basketball .   In 1983, The  United States Football League  (USFL) made its debut on ESPN and ABC. The league (which lasted for three seasons) enjoyed ephemeral success, some portion of which was a byproduct of the exposure afforded through ESPN's coverage.   In  1987 , ESPN gained partial rights to the  National Football League . The league agreed to the deal as long as ESPN agreed to  simulcast  the games on local  television stations  in the participating  markets .  ESPN Sunday Night Football  would last for 19 years and spur ESPN's rise to legitimacy. In the 2006 NFL season, ESPN began airing  Monday Night Football , formerly seen on its sister network ABC. ( NBC  took over the Sunday night game, which replaced the Monday night contest as the league's weekly centerpiece game.) Former Commissioner  Paul Tagliabue  credits ESPN for revolutinizing the NFL, ""ESPN was able to take the draft, the pregame and highlight shows, and other NFL programming to a new level."" [ 2 ]   In 1990, ESPN added  Major League Baseball  to its lineup with a $400 million contract. [ 3 ] ; the contract has been renewed and will continue through at least 2011.  Jon Miller  and  Joe Morgan  are the longtime voices of the network's centerpiece  Sunday Night Baseball .   ESPN broadcast each of the four  major professional sports leagues  in North America from 2002 until 2004, when it cut ties with the  National Hockey League [ 4 ] ; the network had aired NHL games from 1983-86 and again since 1993.   ESPN has been broadcasting  Major League Soccer  games about once a week on ESPN2 since that league's inception in 1996. In most years, the annual  All-Star Game  and  MLS Cup  championship game, and in some years the Opening Night game, are shown on ABC broadcast stations.   ESPN broadcasts 65 sports, 24 hours a day in 15 languages in more than 150 countries. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Expansion   What set ESPN apart from the rest of the competition is that they got the top reporters for each of their respective sports by the early 1990's. Some examples included:  Peter Gammons  (baseball),  Chris Mortensen  (football),  Al Morganti  (hockey), and  David Aldridge  (basketball), and  Mel Kiper Jr.  (NFL Draft). They later added top-notch reporters including  Andrea Kremer ,  Ed Werder ,  Mark Schwartz , and  Greg Garber .   The 1990s and early 2000s saw considerable growth within the company. In 1993,  ESPN2  was founded, with  Keith Olbermann  and  Suzy Kolber  launching the network with SportsNite.  Three years later ,  ESPNEWS  was born, with  Mike Tirico  as the first  anchor . In 1997, ESPN purchased Classic Sports Network and renamed it  ESPN Classic . The latest ESPN network in the U.S.,  ESPNU , began on March 4, 2005.   ESPN International  began in the early 1990s to take advantage of the growing satellite markets in  Asia ,  Africa , and  Latin America . In  Canada , ESPN, Inc. purchased a minority share of  TSN  and  RDS  (in fact, the current corporate logo of both looks similar to that of ESPN). In 2004, ESPN finally entered the  European  market by launching a version of  ESPN Classic , and in December 2006, it agreed to purchase  North American Sports Network . On February 1st 2009, NASN was re-branded as ESPN America.  SportsCenter' s primary three broadcasts each day are at 1 a.m.  ET  (which re-airs usually until 9 AM  ET ), 6 p.m.  ET , and 11 p.m.  ET .   In 1994, ESPN set the standard for understanding the role of sports in America with the creation of  The ESPN Sports Poll  by Dr.  Richard Luker . The Sports Poll was the first ongoing national daily study of sports fan activities and interests in the United States.  Sporting News  acknowledged the accomplishments of The ESPN Sports Poll and Dr. Luker in 1996. [ 6 ]   With the increasing costs of live sports entertainment, such as the U.S.$8.8 billion costs for NFL football broadcasts rights for eight years, ""scripted entertainment has become a luxury item for ESPN,"" said David Carter, director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. [ 7 ]   From 1996 onward, ESPN was closely integrated with ABC Sports. That year,  Steve Bornstein , president of ESPN since 1990, was made president of ABC Sports as well. This integration culminated in the 2006 decision to merge ABC Sports' operations with ESPN. As a result, all of ABC's sports programming now uses  ESPN on ABC . However, ABC Sports is still legally separate from ESPN (see below).   ESPN is currently building a full-fledged broadcast production facility in downtown Los Angeles, as a part of the  L.A. Live  complex across from the  Staples Center . The five-story facility will house an ESPN Zone restaurant on the first two floors and two television production studios with digital control rooms on upper floors. It is scheduled to open in spring 2009. One of the studios will host late-night editions of  SportsCenter . [ 8 ]   In 2007, ESPN signed an agreement with the  Arena Football League  to broadcast at least one game every weekend, usually on Monday nights.   As of January 15, 2008, ESPN has signed a multi-million dollar contract with professional gaming circuit  Major League Gaming  or MLG for short. Although some have argued that professional gaming is not a physical sport, ESPN has gone ahead with this collaboration.     [ edit ]   War Force   www.myspace.com/warforce66 (of destuction)     [ edit ]   Ownership history   As mentioned, William Rasmussen founded the show. Just before ESPN launched,  Getty Oil  Company (later purchased by  Texaco , which in turn was acquired by  Chevron ) agreed to buy a majority stake in the network.   In 1984,  ABC  made a deal with Getty Oil to acquire ESPN. ABC retained an 80% share, and sold 20% to  Nabisco . The Nabisco shares were later sold to  Hearst Corporation , which still holds a 20% stake today. In 1986, ABC was purchased for $3.5 billion by  Capital Cities Communications . In 1995,  The Walt Disney Company  purchased Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion and picked up an 80% stake in ESPN at that time. According to an analysis published by  Barron's  magazine in February 2008, ESPN ""is probably worth more than 40% of Disney's entire value... based on prevailing cash-flow multiples in the industry.""   Although ESPN has been operated as a Disney subsidiary since 1996, it is still technically a  joint venture  between Disney and Hearst. ESPN will take a relation with Disney's new channel, Disney XD, which is replacing Toon Disney     [ edit ]   ESPNHD   ESPNHD , launched March 30, 2003, is a  720p   high-definition   simulcast  of the cable television network  ESPN , both owned by  Disney  that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ESPNHD along with sister network ABCHD use the  720p  HD line standard because the  ABC  executives proposed a progressive 'p' signal resolves fluid and high speed motion in sports better, particularly during slow motion replays. [ 9 ]   All Bristol studio shows and most live events on ESPN are produced high definition. ESPN is one of the few networks with an all-digital infrastructure. Shows that are recorded elsewhere  such as  Jim Rome Is Burning  ( Los Angeles );  Pardon the Interruption  and  Around the Horn  ( Washington, D.C. ) are presented in a standard definition, 4:3 format with stylized  pillar boxes . ESPN, however maintains a policy that any video that originates in  high definition  must remain in HD when aired on ESPNHD. Unlike all other sports programming networks, ESPN charges for its HD channel.   Recently the network has come under considerable scrutiny from industry technicians and early adopters of HD due to a recent noticeable degradation in picture quality, specifically during live events. It is unclear whether this is the result of over-compression, rate shaping or bit starving from cable and satellite providers or something amiss in the ESPN distribution chain.

[ edit ]   Former Programs   ESPN and its family of networks ( ESPN on ABC ,  ESPN2 ,  ESPNU ,  ESPN Plus  and to a lesser extent  ESPN Classic ) have rights to the following sports and events:   Champ Car World Series on ESPN     1992-2001   2007 (series merged with IRL, beginning with the 2008 season)     The IRL on ESPN     19962009     LPGA Tour on ESPN     19792009   Selected majors through deals with their respective sanctioning bodies     ESPN National Hockey Night     19851988 (National television deal, agreements with individual clubs as early as 1979)   19922004   Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest : 20032008     Major Indoor Soccer League     19851987   20052006 (championship games only)     The IRL on ESPN     19962009       [ edit ]   ESPN in popular culture   ESPN has become a part of popular culture since its inception. Many movies with a general sports theme will include ESPN announcers and programming into their storylines (such as in  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story , which gently lampoons the channel's multiple outlets by referencing the as-yet-nonexistent ESPN8, ""The Ocho"" [ 24 ] , a reference to a nickname sometimes used for ESPN2, ""the Deuce""). In the theatrical hit ""Waterboy"", Adam Sandler's character Bobby Boucher has his college football accomplishes tracked through several fictional ""SportsCenter"" new casts including the ""Bourbon Bowl."" Also, ESPN.com Page 2 columnist Bill Simmons often jokes that he is looking forward to running a future network in any given column;  SportsCenter  anchors appeared as themselves in  music videos  by Brad Paisley ("" I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song) "") and  Hootie and the Blowfish  (""Only Wanna Be With You""); and the short-lived 1998 TV series  Sports Night  (by  West Wing  creator  Aaron Sorkin ) was based around an ESPN-style network and its titular,  SportsCenter -analogue flagship sports results program.   Many jokes have been made by comedians about fake obscure sports that are shown on ESPN.  Dennis Miller  mentioned watching "" sumo   rodeo ,"" while  George Carlin  stated that ESPN showed ""Australian  dick   wrestling "". One of several  Saturday Night Live  skits poking fun at the network features ESPN2 airing a show called  Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly , which includes a fake advertisement for ""Senior Women's Beach Lacrosse."" In the early years of ESPN, ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" even featured a ""Top Ten List"" poking fun at some the obscure sports seen on ESPN at the time. One of the more memorable sports on the list was ""Amish Rake Fighting.""   There are at least 22 children named after the network.

Both ESPN and ESPN2 carried  ABC News  coverage of the  September 11, 2001 attacks . The only original program produced after the preemption was a shortened 6pm edition of  Sportscenter  which focused on covering the cancellations of sporting events in reaction to the terror attacks.   ESPN carried the first day of the  2003 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament  due to  CBS 's coverage of the  Invasion of Iraq . The games were still produced by CBS and distributed to the correct markets through cable companies. The only identifiers of ESPN was the bottomline graphic which ran throughout the entire telecast.

It was founded by  Scott Rasmussen  and his father Bill Rasmussen and launched on September 7, 1979, under the direction of Chet Simmons, who was the network's first President and CEO (and later became the  United States Football League 's first commissioner). Getty Oil Company provided the funding to begin the new venture.  George Bodenheimer  is ESPN's current president, a position he has held since November 19, 1998; since March 3, 2003, he has been the head of ABC Sports as well, which has since been rebranded as  ESPN on ABC  (though ABC Sports still legally has a separate existence).   ESPN's signature telecast,  SportsCenter , debuted with the network and aired its 30,000th episode on February 11, 2007. ESPN broadcasts primarily out of its studios in  Bristol, Connecticut ; it also operates offices out of  New York City ;  Seattle, Washington ;  Charlotte, North Carolina  and  Los Angeles, California ; the Los Angeles office is scheduled to open at  L.A. Live  in 2009. The name of the sport company was lengthened to ""ESPN Inc."" in February 1985.   ESPN markets itself as ""The Worldwide Leader in Sports"", a slogan that appears on nearly all company media but whose origin is unknown.   Most programming on ESPN and its affiliated networks is composed of live or tape-delayed sporting events and sports-related news programming (such as  SportsCenter ) with the remainder filled by sports-related talk shows (such as  Around the Horn ,  Jim Rome is Burning ,  Outside the Lines , and  PTI ) and sports-related documentaries.

In the mid-1970s, Rasmussen worked for the  World Hockey Association 's  New England Whalers , selling commercial time for their broadcasts. His son Scott, a former high school goaltender, was the team's  public-address announcer . Both were fired in 1977 and Rasmussen sought a new business venture. His original idea was a  cable television  network (then a fairly new medium) that focused on covering sports events in the state of  Connecticut  (for example, the  Hartford Whalers , Bristol Red Sox, and the  Connecticut Huskies ). When Rasmussen was told that buying a continuous 24-hour satellite feed was less expensive than buying several blocks of only a few hours a night, he expanded to a 24-hour nationwide network. The channel's original name was ESP, for Entertainment and Sports Programming, but it was changed prior to launch. [ 1 ]   ESPN started with the debut of  SportsCenter  hosted by  Lee Leonard  and  George Grande  on September 7, 1979. Afterwards was a pro slow pitch softball game. The first score on  SportsCenter  was from women's  tennis  on the final weekend of the  US Open .   To help fill 24 hours a day of air time, ESPN aired a wide variety of sports events that broadcast networks did not show on weekends, including  Australian Rules Football ,  Davis Cup tennis ,  professional wrestling ,  boxing , and additional  college football  and  basketball  games. The U.S. Olympic Festival, the now-defunct competition that was organized as a training tool by the  United States Olympic Committee , was also an ESPN staple during this time.     [ edit ]   Professional sports arrive   ESPN (along with the  USA Network ) was among the earliest cable-based broadcast partners for the  National Basketball Association  (NBA). Lasting from 198284, the network's relationship with the association marked its initial foray into the American professional sports sector. After an eighteen-year hiatus, ESPN (by then, under the auspices of the  ABC  network), secured a $2.4 billion/six-year broadcast contract with the NBA, thereby revitalizing its historic compact with U.S.  professional basketball .   In 1983, The  United States Football League  (USFL) made its debut on ESPN and ABC. The league (which lasted for three seasons) enjoyed ephemeral success, some portion of which was a byproduct of the exposure afforded through ESPN's coverage.   In  1987 , ESPN gained partial rights to the  National Football League . The league agreed to the deal as long as ESPN agreed to  simulcast  the games on local  television stations  in the participating  markets .  ESPN Sunday Night Football  would last for 19 years and spur ESPN's rise to legitimacy. In the 2006 NFL season, ESPN began airing  Monday Night Football , formerly seen on its sister network ABC. ( NBC  took over the Sunday night game, which replaced the Monday night contest as the league's weekly centerpiece game.) Former Commissioner  Paul Tagliabue  credits ESPN for revolutinizing the NFL, ""ESPN was able to take the draft, the pregame and highlight shows, and other NFL programming to a new level."" [ 2 ]   In 1990, ESPN added  Major League Baseball  to its lineup with a $400 million contract. [ 3 ] ; the contract has been renewed and will continue through at least 2011.  Jon Miller  and  Joe Morgan  are the longtime voices of the network's centerpiece  Sunday Night Baseball .   ESPN broadcast each of the four  major professional sports leagues  in North America from 2002 until 2004, when it cut ties with the  National Hockey League [ 4 ] ; the network had aired NHL games from 1983-86 and again since 1993.   ESPN has been broadcasting  Major League Soccer  games about once a week on ESPN2 since that league's inception in 1996. In most years, the annual  All-Star Game  and  MLS Cup  championship game, and in some years the Opening Night game, are shown on ABC broadcast stations.   ESPN broadcasts 65 sports, 24 hours a day in 15 languages in more than 150 countries. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Expansion   What set ESPN apart from the rest of the competition is that they got the top reporters for each of their respective sports by the early 1990's. Some examples included:  Peter Gammons  (baseball),  Chris Mortensen  (football),  Al Morganti  (hockey), and  David Aldridge  (basketball), and  Mel Kiper Jr.  (NFL Draft). They later added top-notch reporters including  Andrea Kremer ,  Ed Werder ,  Mark Schwartz , and  Greg Garber .   The 1990s and early 2000s saw considerable growth within the company. In 1993,  ESPN2  was founded, with  Keith Olbermann  and  Suzy Kolber  launching the network with SportsNite.  Three years later ,  ESPNEWS  was born, with  Mike Tirico  as the first  anchor . In 1997, ESPN purchased Classic Sports Network and renamed it  ESPN Classic . The latest ESPN network in the U.S.,  ESPNU , began on March 4, 2005.   ESPN International  began in the early 1990s to take advantage of the growing satellite markets in  Asia ,  Africa , and  Latin America . In  Canada , ESPN, Inc. purchased a minority share of  TSN  and  RDS  (in fact, the current corporate logo of both looks similar to that of ESPN). In 2004, ESPN finally entered the  European  market by launching a version of  ESPN Classic , and in December 2006, it agreed to purchase  North American Sports Network . On February 1st 2009, NASN was re-branded as ESPN America.  SportsCenter' s primary three broadcasts each day are at 1 a.m.  ET  (which re-airs usually until 9 AM  ET ), 6 p.m.  ET , and 11 p.m.  ET .   In 1994, ESPN set the standard for understanding the role of sports in America with the creation of  The ESPN Sports Poll  by Dr.  Richard Luker . The Sports Poll was the first ongoing national daily study of sports fan activities and interests in the United States.  Sporting News  acknowledged the accomplishments of The ESPN Sports Poll and Dr. Luker in 1996. [ 6 ]   With the increasing costs of live sports entertainment, such as the U.S.$8.8 billion costs for NFL football broadcasts rights for eight years, ""scripted entertainment has become a luxury item for ESPN,"" said David Carter, director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. [ 7 ]   From 1996 onward, ESPN was closely integrated with ABC Sports. That year,  Steve Bornstein , president of ESPN since 1990, was made president of ABC Sports as well. This integration culminated in the 2006 decision to merge ABC Sports' operations with ESPN. As a result, all of ABC's sports programming now uses  ESPN on ABC . However, ABC Sports is still legally separate from ESPN (see below).   ESPN is currently building a full-fledged broadcast production facility in downtown Los Angeles, as a part of the  L.A. Live  complex across from the  Staples Center . The five-story facility will house an ESPN Zone restaurant on the first two floors and two television production studios with digital control rooms on upper floors. It is scheduled to open in spring 2009. One of the studios will host late-night editions of  SportsCenter . [ 8 ]   In 2007, ESPN signed an agreement with the  Arena Football League  to broadcast at least one game every weekend, usually on Monday nights.   As of January 15, 2008, ESPN has signed a multi-million dollar contract with professional gaming circuit  Major League Gaming  or MLG for short. Although some have argued that professional gaming is not a physical sport, ESPN has gone ahead with this collaboration.     [ edit ]   Controversy     See also:  Criticism of ESPN       [ edit ]   Ownership history   As mentioned, William Rasmussen founded the show. Just before ESPN launched,  Getty Oil  Company (later purchased by  Texaco , which in turn was acquired by  Chevron ) agreed to buy a majority stake in the network.   In 1984,  ABC  made a deal with Getty Oil to acquire ESPN. ABC retained an 80% share, and sold 20% to  Nabisco . The Nabisco shares were later sold to  Hearst Corporation , which still holds a 20% stake today. In 1986, ABC was purchased for $3.5 billion by  Capital Cities Communications . In 1995,  The Walt Disney Company  purchased Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion and picked up an 80% stake in ESPN at that time. According to an analysis published by  Barron's  magazine in February 2008, ESPN ""is probably worth more than 40% of Disney's entire value... based on prevailing cash-flow multiples in the industry.""   Although ESPN has been operated as a Disney subsidiary since 1996, it is still technically a  joint venture  between Disney and Hearst. ESPN will take a relation with Disney's new channel, Disney XD, which is replacing Toon Disney     [ edit ]   ESPNHD   ESPNHD , launched March 30, 2003, is a  720p   high-definition   simulcast  of the cable television network  ESPN , both owned by  Disney  that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ESPNHD along with sister network ABCHD use the  720p  HD line standard because the  ABC  executives proposed a progressive 'p' signal resolves fluid and high speed motion in sports better, particularly during slow motion replays. [ 9 ]   All Bristol studio shows and most live events on ESPN are produced high definition. ESPN is one of the few networks with an all-digital infrastructure. Shows that are recorded elsewhere  such as  Jim Rome Is Burning  ( Los Angeles );  Pardon the Interruption  and  Around the Horn  ( Washington, D.C. ) are presented in a standard definition, 4:3 format with stylized  pillar boxes . ESPN, however maintains a policy that any video that originates in  high definition  must remain in HD when aired on ESPNHD. Unlike all other sports programming networks, ESPN charges for its HD channel.   Recently the network has come under considerable scrutiny from industry technicians and early adopters of HD due to a recent noticeable degradation in picture quality, specifically during live events. It is unclear whether this is the result of over-compression, rate shaping or bit starving from cable and satellite providers or something amiss in the ESPN distribution chain.

Many movies with a general sports theme will include ESPN announcers and programming into their storylines (such as in  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story , which gently lampoons the channel's multiple outlets by referencing the as-yet-nonexistent ESPN8, ""The Ocho"" [ 24 ] , a reference to a nickname sometimes used for ESPN2, ""the Deuce""). In the theatrical hit ""Waterboy"", Adam Sandler's character Bobby Boucher has his college football accomplishes tracked through several fictional ""SportsCenter"" newscasts including the ""Bourbon Bowl."" Also, ESPN.com Page 2 columnist Bill Simmons often jokes that he is looking forward to running a future network in any given column;  SportsCenter  anchors appeared as themselves in  music videos  by Brad Paisley ("" I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song) "") and  Hootie and the Blowfish  (""Only Wanna Be With You""); and the short-lived 1998 TV series  Sports Night  (by  West Wing  creator  Aaron Sorkin ) was based around an ESPN-style network and its titular,  SportsCenter -analogue flagship sports results program.   Many jokes have been made by comedians about fake obscure sports that are shown on ESPN.  Dennis Miller  mentioned watching "" sumo   rodeo ,"" while  George Carlin  stated that ESPN showed ""Australian  dick   wrestling "". One of several  Saturday Night Live  skits poking fun at the network features ESPN2 airing a show called  Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly , which includes a fake advertisement for ""Senior Women's Beach Lacrosse."" In the early years of ESPN, ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" even featured a ""Top Ten List"" poking fun at some the obscure sports seen on ESPN at the time. One of the more memorable sports on the list was ""Amish Rake Fighting.""   There are at least 22 children named after the network.

ESPN carried the first day of the  2003 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament  due to  CBS 's coverage of the  Invasion of Iraq . The games were still produced by CBS and distributed to the correct markets through cable companies.

It was founded by  Scott Rasmussen  and his father Bill Rasmussen and launched on September 7, 1979, under the direction of Chet Simmons, who was the network's first President and CEO (and later became the  United States Football League 's first commissioner). Getty Oil Company provided the funding to begin the new venture.  George Bodenheimer  is ESPN's current president, a position he has held since November 19, 1998; since March 3, 2003, he has been the head of ABC Sports as well, which has since been rebranded as  ESPN on ABC  (though ABC Sports still legally has a separate existence).   ESPN's signature telecast,  SportsCenter , debuted with the network and aired its 30,000th episode on February 11, 2007. ESPN broadcasts primarily out of its studios in  Bristol, Connecticut ; it also operates offices out of  New York City ;  Seattle, Washington ;  Charlotte, North Carolina  and  Los Angeles, California ; the Los Angeles office is scheduled to open at  L.A. Live  in 2009. The name of the sport company was lengthened to ""ESPN Inc."" in February 1985.   ESPN markets itself as ""The Worldwide Leader in Sports"", a slogan that appears on nearly all company media but whose origin is unknown.   Most programming on ESPN and its affiliated networks is composed of live or tape-delayed sporting events and sports-related news programming (such as  SportsCenter ) with the remainder filled by sports-related talk shows (such as  Around the Horn ,  Jim Rome is Burning ,  Outside the Lines , and  PTI ) and sports-related documentaries.

In the mid-1970s, Rasmussen worked for the  World Hockey Association 's  New England Whalers , selling commercial time for their broadcasts. His son Scott, a former high school goaltender, was the team's  public-address announcer . Both were fired in 1977 and Rasmussen sought a new business venture. His original idea was a  cable television  network (then a fairly new medium) that focused on covering sports events in the state of  Connecticut  (for example, the  Hartford Whalers , Bristol Red Sox, and the  Connecticut Huskies ). When Rasmussen was told that buying a continuous 24-hour satellite feed was less expensive than buying several blocks of only a few hours a night, he expanded to a 24-hour nationwide network. The channel's original name was ESP, for Entertainment and Sports Programming, but it was changed prior to launch. [ 1 ]   ESPN started with the debut of  SportsCenter  hosted by  Lee Leonard  and  George Grande  on September 7, 1979. Afterwards was a pro slow pitch softball game. The first score on  SportsCenter  was from women's  tennis  on the final weekend of the  US Open .   To help fill 24 hours a day of air time, ESPN aired a wide variety of sports events that broadcast networks did not show on weekends, including  Australian Rules Football ,  Davis Cup tennis ,  professional wrestling ,  boxing , and additional  college football  and  basketball  games. The U.S. Olympic Festival, the now-defunct competition that was organized as a training tool by the  United States Olympic Committee , was also an ESPN staple during this time.     [ edit ]   Professional sports arrive   ESPN (along with the  USA Network ) was among the earliest cable-based broadcast partners for the  National Basketball Association  (NBA). Lasting from 198284, the network's relationship with the association marked its initial foray into the American professional sports sector. After an eighteen-year hiatus, ESPN (by then, under the auspices of the  ABC  network), secured a $2.4 billion/six-year broadcast contract with the NBA, thereby revitalizing its historic compact with U.S.  professional basketball .   In 1983, The  United States Football League  (USFL) made its debut on ESPN and ABC. The league (which lasted for three seasons) enjoyed ephemeral success, some portion of which was a byproduct of the exposure afforded through ESPN's coverage.   In  1987 , ESPN gained partial rights to the  National Football League . The league agreed to the deal as long as ESPN agreed to  simulcast  the games on local  television stations  in the participating  markets .  ESPN Sunday Night Football  would last for 19 years and spur ESPN's rise to legitimacy. In the 2006 NFL season, ESPN began airing  Monday Night Football , formerly seen on its sister network ABC. ( NBC  took over the Sunday night game, which replaced the Monday night contest as the league's weekly centerpiece game.) Former Commissioner  Paul Tagliabue  credits ESPN for revolutinizing the NFL, ""ESPN was able to take the draft, the pregame and highlight shows, and other NFL programming to a new level."" [ 2 ]   In 1990, ESPN added  Major League Baseball  to its lineup with a $400 million contract. [ 3 ] ; the contract has been renewed and will continue through at least 2011.  Jon Miller  and  Joe Morgan  are the longtime voices of the network's centerpiece  Sunday Night Baseball .   ESPN broadcast each of the four  major professional sports leagues  in North America from 2002 until 2004, when it cut ties with the  National Hockey League [ 4 ] ; the network had aired NHL games from 1983-86 and again since 1993.   ESPN has been broadcasting  Major League Soccer  games about once a week on ESPN2 since that league's inception in 1996. In most years, the annual  All-Star Game  and  MLS Cup  championship game, and in some years the Opening Night game, are shown on ABC broadcast stations.   ESPN broadcasts 65 sports, 24 hours a day in 15 languages in more than 150 countries. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Expansion   What set ESPN apart from the rest of the competition is that they got the top reporters for each of their respective sports by the early 1990's. Some examples included:  Peter Gammons  (baseball),  Chris Mortensen  (football),  Al Morganti  (hockey), and  David Aldridge  (basketball), and  Mel Kiper Jr.  (NFL Draft). They later added top-notch reporters including  Andrea Kremer ,  Ed Werder ,  Mark Schwartz , and  Greg Garber .   The 1990s and early 2000s saw considerable growth within the company. In 1993,  ESPN2  was founded, with  Keith Olbermann  and  Suzy Kolber  launching the network with SportsNite.  Three years later ,  ESPNEWS  was born, with  Mike Tirico  as the first  anchor . In 1997, ESPN purchased Classic Sports Network and renamed it  ESPN Classic . The latest ESPN network in the U.S.,  ESPNU , began on March 4, 2005.   ESPN International  began in the early 1990s to take advantage of the growing satellite markets in  Asia ,  Africa , and  Latin America . In  Canada , ESPN, Inc. purchased a minority share of  TSN  and  RDS  (in fact, the current corporate logo of both looks similar to that of ESPN). In 2004, ESPN finally entered the  European  market by launching a version of  ESPN Classic , and in December 2006, it agreed to purchase  North American Sports Network . On February 1st 2009, NASN was re-branded as ESPN America.  SportsCenter' s primary three broadcasts each day are at 1 a.m.  ET  (which re-airs usually until 9 AM  ET ), 6 p.m.  ET , and 11 p.m.  ET .   In 1994, ESPN set the standard for understanding the role of sports in America with the creation of  The ESPN Sports Poll  by Dr.  Richard Luker . The Sports Poll was the first ongoing national daily study of sports fan activities and interests in the United States.  Sporting News  acknowledged the accomplishments of The ESPN Sports Poll and Dr. Luker in 1996. [ 6 ]   With the increasing costs of live sports entertainment, such as the U.S.$8.8 billion costs for NFL football broadcasts rights for eight years, ""scripted entertainment has become a luxury item for ESPN,"" said David Carter, director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. [ 7 ]   From 1996 onward, ESPN was closely integrated with ABC Sports. That year,  Steve Bornstein , president of ESPN since 1990, was made president of ABC Sports as well. This integration culminated in the 2006 decision to merge ABC Sports' operations with ESPN. As a result, all of ABC's sports programming now uses  ESPN on ABC . However, ABC Sports is still legally separate from ESPN (see below).   ESPN is currently building a full-fledged broadcast production facility in downtown Los Angeles, as a part of the  L.A. Live  complex across from the  Staples Center . The five-story facility will house an ESPN Zone restaurant on the first two floors and two television production studios with digital control rooms on upper floors. It is scheduled to open in spring 2009. One of the studios will host late-night editions of  SportsCenter . [ 8 ]   In 2007, ESPN signed an agreement with the  Arena Football League  to broadcast at least one game every weekend, usually on Monday nights.   As of January 15, 2008, ESPN has signed a multi-million dollar contract with professional gaming circuit  Major League Gaming  or MLG for short. Although some have argued that professional gaming is not a physical sport, ESPN has gone ahead with this collaboration.     [ edit ]   Controversy     See also:  Criticism of ESPN       [ edit ]   Ownership history   As mentioned, William Rasmussen founded the show. Just before ESPN launched,  Getty Oil  Company (later purchased by  Texaco , which in turn was acquired by  Chevron ) agreed to buy a majority stake in the network.   In 1984,  ABC  made a deal with Getty Oil to acquire ESPN. ABC retained an 80% share, and sold 20% to  Nabisco . The Nabisco shares were later sold to  Hearst Corporation , which still holds a 20% stake today. In 1986, ABC was purchased for $3.5 billion by  Capital Cities Communications . In 1995,  The Walt Disney Company  purchased Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion and picked up an 80% stake in ESPN at that time. According to an analysis published by  Barron's  magazine in February 2008, ESPN ""is probably worth more than 40% of Disney's entire value... based on prevailing cash-flow multiples in the industry.""   Although ESPN has been operated as a Disney subsidiary since 1996, it is still technically a  joint venture  between Disney and Hearst. ESPN will take a relation with Disney's new channel, Disney XD, which is replacing Toon Disney     [ edit ]   ESPNHD   ESPNHD , launched March 30, 2003, is a  720p   high-definition   simulcast  of the cable television network  ESPN , both owned by  Disney  that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ESPNHD along with sister network ABCHD use the  720p  HD line standard because the  ABC  executives proposed a progressive 'p' signal resolves fluid and high speed motion in sports better, particularly during slow motion replays. [ 9 ]   All Bristol studio shows and most live events on ESPN are produced high definition. ESPN is one of the few networks with an all-digital infrastructure. Shows that are recorded elsewhere  such as  Jim Rome Is Burning  ( Los Angeles );  Pardon the Interruption  and  Around the Horn  ( Washington, D.C. ) are presented in a standard definition, 4:3 format with stylized  pillar boxes . ESPN, however maintains a policy that any video that originates in  high definition  must remain in HD when aired on ESPNHD. Unlike all other sports programming networks, ESPN charges for its HD channel.   Recently the network has come under considerable scrutiny from industry technicians and early adopters of HD due to a recent noticeable degradation in picture quality, specifically during live events. It is unclear whether this is the result of over-compression, rate shaping or bit starving from cable and satellite providers or something amiss in the ESPN distribution chain.

Many movies with a general sports theme will include ESPN announcers and programming into their storylines (such as in  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story , which gently lampoons the channel's multiple outlets by referencing the as-yet-nonexistent ESPN8, ""The Ocho"" [ 24 ] , a reference to a nickname sometimes used for ESPN2, ""the Deuce""). In the theatrical hit ""Waterboy"", Adam Sandler's character Bobby Boucher has his college football accomplishes tracked through several fictional ""SportsCenter"" newscasts including the ""Bourbon Bowl."" Also, ESPN.com Page 2 columnist Bill Simmons often jokes that he is looking forward to running a future network in any given column;  SportsCenter  anchors appeared as themselves in  music videos  by Brad Paisley ("" I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song) "") and  Hootie and the Blowfish  (""Only Wanna Be With You""); and the short-lived 1998 TV series  Sports Night  (by  West Wing  creator  Aaron Sorkin ) was based around an ESPN-style network and its titular,  SportsCenter -analogue flagship sports results program.   Many jokes have been made by comedians about fake obscure sports that are shown on ESPN.  Dennis Miller  mentioned watching "" sumo   rodeo ,"" while  George Carlin  stated that ESPN showed ""Australian  dick   wrestling "". One of several  Saturday Night Live  skits poking fun at the network features ESPN2 airing a show called  Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly , which includes a fake advertisement for ""Senior Women's Beach Lacrosse."" In the early years of ESPN, ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" even featured a ""Top Ten List"" poking fun at some the obscure sports seen on ESPN at the time. One of the more memorable sports on the list was ""Amish Rake Fighting.""   There are at least 22 children named after the network.

ESPN The Magazine comes in a tabloid format; it covers most all of the American sports quite well. It usually has some sports celebrity profiles, columnists, and some great pictures of the last two weeks in sports. Beyond that by subscribing to the magazine you can also get access to the Insider columns at ESPN.com. This is one of the better sports magazines out there. I prefer it to most compared to the others ones on the market. Highly recommended!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              BETTER TOGETHER: Purchase  ESPN Magazine  plus:                                    +                                                                                      =        ESPN Magazine  and  Golf Digest : Cover Price: $151.62 Your Price: $27.92                                                 +                                                                                      =        ESPN Magazine  and  Field & Stream : Cover Price: $151.62 Your Price: $27.92                                                                                                                                                       CUSTOMER REVIEWS:                                                                                                                                                                                                    Submitted By:  angela leaney: ESPN  the Magazine is a great read, especially for the smallest room in the house. Like the TV network, the editorial is clearly created by knowledgeable and enthusiastic sports fans, but it's not just all vanity pieces - the interviews ask the questions that YOU would ask, political correctness and spin aside. The spread of sports is pretty broad, but female and international sports are not so well represented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Sam Bear: ESPN  the magazine provides an insiders look into the world of sports. The magazine allows for a more in depth look at today top sports stories, as well as details stories that you might not see on television.

Submitted By:  Matt Willis: As a long time subscriber to the other big sports magazine, I was more and more disappointed with the lack of coverage of sports.  ESPN  the magazine is an extension of the network I get all of my sports news from, I recommend it to all sports enthusiasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  tadakimi takashima: I love  ESPN  the magazine!! I've subscribed to it for a couple years already but I just like how they have great pictures and articles. Although they don't go too much into detail for the articles they write, they are still interesting and worth reading. I'd recommend this magazine if you are really just like to browse through many great pictures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Brenda Burrows: This is the second time my son has received the subscription of  ESPN  the magazine. I let the first subscription run out. Every time the magazine is due he wants to know that he has received it. He is really a sports fan of all teams (he is 16 and plays football, baseball, and basketball). He has learned so much from your magazine. Keep up the good work.

Submitted By:  Versailles Agee: I purchased  ESPN  the magazine and I feel it is the best sport magazine on the market. It is a very informative magazine that helps people who wouldn normally read sport magazines read them. I love the part of the magazine that asks athletes from different sports about every day thoughts of the average person.

It is very interesting to read up on all the athletes and sports organizations around the world.  ESPN  has the best TV show in SportsCenter and now they have the best sports magazine as well. As soon as the magazine comes out, I read it from cover to cover instantly and then cannot wait for the next month issue! Great Job!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  CURTIS NESBITT: Even my wife likes to read  ESPN  magazine. The content is geared towards the typical sports fan, but more than half of the stories in the magazine each week are biographical in nature and go into great details of the selected sports figures life. The stories revolve around sports, but are interesting on other levels as well. Like I said, my wife typically reads several articles in each issue, and she hates to watch Sportscenter. Great magazine - it comes once every two weeks, which actually works better with my schedule anyway because weekly magazines make me feel like I've wasted my money when I can't find the time to read them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Colin Duncan: ESPN  the Magazine is the perfect publication for every sports fan. Each issue dives into interesting stories involving the players you thought you knew.  ESPN  the Magazine also sets itself apart from other sports publications by bringing a certain comedic edge to articles, livening up any story from football to curling. I couldn imagine not being a subscriber to this magazine and I recommend it to any and every sports fan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Sherry Nichols: I ordered an  ESPN  magazine subscription for my high school students. It is one of the most highly requested magazines by the boys I teach. It beat out Sports Illustrated! I've kept old copies of  ESPN  from home in my classroom for years. Even students who don't normally enjoy reading line up to read this one!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  ed kush: I really like  ESPN  the magazine compared to other sports magazines. The writing is really objective and open minded. They also cover all major sports around the globe. I really like the piece they wrote last year about PSU's freshman wide receivers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Brian Kane: ESPN  the Magazine has taken over as the leading sports publication today. It covers all professional and college sports that are in the news; excellent photographs and insightful articles. Also includes fantasy and NASCAR coverage. It brings  ESPN  from the TV to a magazine. I would highly recommend  ESPN  the magazine and look forward to subscribing to  ESPN  the Magazine for years to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Kevin Roche: If you are a sports fan,  ESPN  Magazine is definitely a must have. With their in-depth coverage, and exciting photographs, this magazine satisfies my need for sports information. Also, its larger size allows me to really see the photos more clearly, which is a definite plus. While being the leader in sports entertainment on television, I now believe that  ESPN  is now the leader in print for sports entertainment also.

With articles and pictures on sports from around the country and world, you can't pass on  ESPN !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Scott Friedman: ESPN  the Magazine is a must have for any sports fan. The articles are well written and the photographs really bring the athletes to life. It really differentiates itself from other sports magazines by focusing more on upcoming sporting events rather than what already happened. They also devote a good amount of space to alternative sports. This magazine is a good addition to the  ESPN  TV network and  ESPN .com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Maury Rogoff: ESPN  Magazine is one of the most visually pleasing magazines I read. If there is an occasion when I am fatigued, and just can't bring myself to read another word of text of ANYTHING, I know that I can pick up this magazine still, and enjoy the experience of perusing each page for its photographs. This is not to say that  ESPN  doesn't have great articles. It does! There are in-depth pieces on topics of interest from the world of sport, plus shorter ""front-of-book"" things to read about athletes and experiences that are fun to read. I think that  ESPN  magazine's format is pleasing and the size and feel of the magazine's pages help make it one of my favorites.  ESPN  gives me the chance to read more in-depth about sports that I know and love, as well as introduce me to sports and athletes that I am unfamiliar with, all in a stimulating, visually exciting publication.

Fig. skating  Football  Other sports                  Sunday, February 4         Ferrari strong; Minardi still incomplete     Reuters      LONDON -- The Formula One countdown entered its final month on Sunday with Michael Schumacher and world champions Ferrari already showing their competitive edge in preseason tests.         Schumacher set a lap record at Ferrari's own Fiorano track in the new F2001 on Saturday while Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello set the fastest time yet at Barcelona's circuit in last year's car.         ""I think we can be very pleased by the times but we should be even more pleased by the reliability,"" the German said after earlier impressive times on Friday.         ""In all my career, I have never had a start with everything working so well from the outset,"" Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper quoted him as saying.         The first race of the season is in Melbourne on March 4 and Schumacher said he expected it to be a familiar story of Ferrari against McLaren, who unveil their new MP4/16 challenger in Valencia on Wednesday.          The two teams won every race between them last season and took the lion's share of the points.         ""But I think we will see more teams winning races,"" Schumacher said. ""I don't know which but others will have a chance of victory.         ""Maybe my brother Ralf will have a chance with the Williams. I see also Sauber and Prost are strong and they are to be mentioned along with Jordan.""         Sauber, with the youngest lineup in Formula One, have Ferrari 2000 specification engines as do Prost.    Benetton heads for Venice  Ferrari will continue testing in Italy next week, with Schumacher scheduled to test the new car at the Mugello circuit before being awarded the honorary citizenship of Ferrari's home city of Modena on Tuesday evening.         Barrichello is also due at Mugello.         McLaren will get down to serious business in Spain with their new car after giving some fresh faces a chance in the old car at Jerez last week.         Britons Darren Turner and Gary Paffett, last year's McLaren Autosport young driver of the year, both had outings as did Italian F3 driver Giorgio Pantano.         Benetton will be bucking a trend on Tuesday, going against the season's fashion for low-key launches with what promises to be a spectacular unveiling of their B201 on an island in the Venice lagoon.         The car will have a revolutionary new Renault V10 engine but Italian Giancarlo Fisichella warned last week that it was still too early to say how it would perform.         Benetton will be testing at Estoril in Portugal next week with other teams using Michelin tires. The Prost team will test its new AP04 chassis.         ""There's a lot to be done. In the first three races we will not be competitive but then there will be a big improvement,"" Fisichella told the Gazzetta last week.         One more piece of the jigsaw should be fitted into place in Italy on Tuesday -- the day the Minardi team says it intends to name one of its 2001 drivers following Australian Paul Stoddart's takeover.         He is expected to be young Spaniard Fernando Alonso, who tested at Vairano in Italy on Saturday, with the second driver to follow a week later.         Minardi is the only team yet to name its lineup.         If Alonso is confirmed, he will be the fifth Formula One newcomer on the grid in Melbourne, not including the returning French driver Olivier Panis at BAR.                            ESPN.com:    Help  |  PR Media Kit  |  Sales Media Kit  |      Contact Us  |  Tools  |  Jobs at ESPN  |  Supplier Information  |   Copyright ©2007 ESPN Internet Ventures.

For the Canadian  TSN  show, see  SportsCentre .

Originally airing once per day,  SportsCenter  is now shown up to twelve times a day, replaying the day's scores and highlights from major  sporting events , along with commentary, previews and feature stories. Due to its durability, it has been shown more times than any other show in American television, with over 30,000 unique episodes. It celebrated its 30,000th show on February 11, 2007. The show is taped in ESPN's  HDTV  studio facilities in  Bristol, Connecticut .

The 1:00 a.m. edition is repeated at 2:00 a.m. and again from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.   Saturday viewers see a new episode from 10:00 a.m. to noon, along with the evening airings as above. On Sundays, a half-hour episode airs at 9:00 a.m. and another edition of varying length airs at 10:30 a.m.; the 11:00 p.m. edition airs for 90 minutes on Sundays and is repeated through the night. In the event of live sports coverage on the network, the show is occasionally delayed or moved to another ESPN channel. The show also is known to start early and run long, if the preceding game ends ahead of schedule or if breaking news warrants.     [ edit ]   History     [ edit ]   Standard definition era   George Grande  introduced the country to ESPN when he co-anchored the first ever  SportsCenter  on September 7,  1979 . His fellow anchor was Lee Leonard, a longtime New York broadcaster. According to  Entertainment Weekly , Leonard spoke these words as the show opened: ""If you're a fan, what you will see in the next few minutes, hours, and days to follow may convince you that you've gone to sports heaven."" (Entertainment Weekly, 8 September 2000, p. 94) Grande spent ten more years with ESPN and  SportsCenter  until  1989 . Another early addition to the show was  Chris Berman , who joined ESPN a month after it was on the air, and became a fixture at SportsCenter until the early '90s, when his main efforts became focused on the network's  NFL coverage  and  Baseball Tonight ; however, Berman remains a frequent contributor to the Sunday night 11 p.m. edition.  Bob Ley  also began anchoring early in the show's history and still regularly appears on the Sunday morning  SportsCenter  in addition to hosting  Outside the Lines .   In 1988, the format was changed by executive editor John Walsh from individual sports or leagues to ""newspaper style."" Thus, it aired stories based on their importance regardless of the sport. [ 1 ]   Early graphics and music included various kinds of sports balls flying outward, featuring a rapid-fire electronic audio track that was a version of ""Pulstar,"" by  Vangelis . By the early 1990s, the first of several theme songs to incorporate ESPN's trademark ""duh-nuh-nuh, duh-nuh-nuh"" fanfare was in use. The current theme music was composed by  Annie Roboff , a composer who also co-wrote  Faith Hill 's  1998  hit "" This Kiss ."" [ 2 ]   Throughout the 1990s, SportsCenter's set saw many changes (see below). In  1994 , ESPN began the  This is SportsCenter  ad campaign to promote their show.  [ 3 ]   The 11 p.m. anchor team of  Dan Patrick  and  Keith Olbermann  achieved great popularity in the late '80s and the '90s (interrupted by Olbermann's brief move to ESPN2 at that channel's launch). After Olbermann left ESPN in 1997,  Kenny Mayne  became Patrick's co-host; when Patrick moved to the 6:00 p.m. edition,  Rich Eisen  and  Stuart Scott  became the top anchor team.   During the summer of 2001, after ESPN, Inc. acquired a share of  Canadian  sports network  TSN , that network's sports news program,  SportsDesk , was re-branded as  SportsCentre  (using  Canadian spelling ).     [ edit ]   September 11, 2001 and The show that nearly wasn't   On  September 11, 2001 , ESPN interrupted regular programming at 11:05 a.m.  Eastern Time  to cover the immediate aftermath of the  attacks on America  through a  simulcast  of  ABC News . The network considered not airing  SportsCenter  that night, and debated the topic for about an hour. Finally, a half-hour version aired which reported on the impact the attacks had on the sports world; announcing the cancellations of major U.S. sporting events that had been announced up to that time. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   High definition era   High definition  broadcasting started on June 7, 2004, and on the same day began broadcasting the show from studios inside the network's brand-new Digital Center, debuting a new set designed by  Walt Disney Imagineering  and featuring a robust graphics package entitled ""Revolution"" designed by  Troika Design Group . During that summer, ESPN celebrated their 25th anniversary,  ESPN25 , by counting down the top 100 moments of the past 25 years. They showed the countdown every day starting May 31, 2004, until the #1 moment, the  U.S. Olympic Men's Ice Hockey Team 's victory over the  USSR  during the  1980 Winter Olympics , was aired on September 7, 2004.   SportsCenter  premiered a segment called "" 50 States in 50 Days ,"" during the summer of 2005, where a different  SportsCenter  anchor traveled to a different state every day to discover the sports, sports history, and athletes of the state. [ 5 ]   On April 4, 2006,  SportsCenter  started showing highlights of  Major League Baseball  games in progress, which were previously an exclusive to another program,  Baseball Tonight . This is seen in the  Baseball Tonight Extra  segment. Prior to that date, highlights of the aforementioned Major League Baseball games weren't shown on  SportsCenter  until the games went final (as shown on the ticker at the bottom of the screen, known as the "" BottomLine "").   On February 11, 2007, after the  NBA  game between the  Chicago Bulls  and the  Phoenix Suns , the 30,000th  SportsCenter  show aired. In that milestone show,  Bob Ley  recapped the events (and not-so-great moments) during the first 10,000 shows,  Chris Berman  did the same during the middle 10,000, as did  Dan Patrick  during the remaining 10,000.  Steve Levy  and  Stuart Scott  were the anchors on that 30,000th show. They also began broadcasting  SportsCenter Minute , which is a web-streaming one-minute  SportsCenter  update seen exclusively on  ESPN.com .   The 11 p.m.  Eastern Time  edition on May 6, 2007 saw another major change, as  SportsCenter  introduced a ""rundown"" graphic across the right side of the screen. This feature appears only during reruns of the overnight show Monday through Saturday and on the main Sunday night program, and on ESPNHD, fills the right  pillarbox  where the ESPNHD logo would usually appear during standard definition footage.   The 6 p.m. ET edition of  SportsCenter  moved up to 5 p.m. ET on May 28, 2007, and -- for the first time ever -- it was extended to three hours. In that episode, ESPN aired live coverage of  Roger Clemens ' second start for the  New York Yankees ' minor league club in  Scranton, Pennsylvania .   The 11pm ET edition of  SportsCenter  on August 7, 2007, which was anchored by John Buccigross and  Cindy Brunson , showed live coverage of  Barry Bonds ' 756th career  home run , which broke the old  MLB  record set by  Hank Aaron .     [ edit ]   2008 daytime expansion   On August 11, 2008, during the opening week of the  Beijing Olympic Games ,  SportsCenter  began airing live from 9am to 3pm  ET . The original plan was to start the live block at 6am; however, the network decided to scale it back to start at 9am.   Former NBC Sports and  CBS Early Show  anchor  Hannah Storm  has joined ESPN to host the 9am to noon block. [ 6 ]  The new format now includes two teams of two anchors in three-hour shifts:     9am - Noon ET:  Josh Elliott , Hannah Storm (Mon-Thurs) or  Sage Steele  (Fri)   Noon - 3pm ET:  Robert Flores ,  Chris McKendry     Storm will also co-anchor the Sunday morning edition with  Bob Ley , replacing McKendry. Steele will provide updates every 20 minutes from 6 am until noon, Mondays through Thursdays.  [ 7 ]   This change also includes a new SportsCenter.com Web site to promote more interaction with viewers. [ 8 ]  The SportsCenter.com site was launched 8/11/08.   To promote these changes, ESPN held a casting of their employees to see who would be on almost 25 live and unscripted commercials a day. Steve Braband, an International Programmer, won, and can be seen about every half-hour (excluding from 1 to 4 CST) on ESPN. Additionally, the website  steveislive.com  was opened, with Steve's daily appearance schedule, blog, and video clips of past appearances and audition footage.

[ edit ]   Conditions to showing highlights   Some sports leagues and organizations, including the  NBA ,  NHL  and college sports conferences, allow for brief highlights to be shown while the game is in progress.  Major League Baseball  allows them only as part of the  Baseball Tonight  mini-programs, as mentioned above. The  NFL  does not allow in-progress highlights at all outside of its own live game broadcasts.   ESPN is traditionally unable to air highlights of  Olympic Games  events until after the events have aired on tape-delay on the broadcast network holding the rights. ESPN began to show more Olympics highlights on-air and online beginning with the  2006 Winter Olympics ; they received these extended rights from NBC as part of the deal that saw ABC release  Al Michaels  from his contract, so he could join  John Madden  and key production personnel for the new  NBC Sunday Night Football . [ 9 ]   In addition, there are many anecdotal reports of various TV networks (such as  CBS Sports  and  NBC Sports ) that will not release highlights of certain sporting events to ESPN unless its name is labeled across the screen for the entire length of the highlight (Courtesy NBC Sports, etc). (In some cases, the same stipulation is made to competing programs like  FSN Final Score , but not in all.)

ESPN The Magazine comes in a tabloid format; it covers most all of the American sports quite well. It usually has some sports celebrity profiles, columnists, and some great pictures of the last two weeks in sports. Beyond that by subscribing to the magazine you can also get access to the Insider columns at ESPN.com. This is one of the better sports magazines out there. I prefer it to most compared to the others ones on the market. Highly recommended!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              BETTER TOGETHER: Purchase  ESPN Magazine  plus:                                    +                                                                                      =        ESPN Magazine  and  Golf Digest : Cover Price: $151.62 Your Price: $27.92                                                 +                                                                                      =        ESPN Magazine  and  Field & Stream : Cover Price: $151.62 Your Price: $27.92                                                                                                                                                       CUSTOMER REVIEWS:                                                                                                                                                                                                    Submitted By:  angela leaney: ESPN  the Magazine is a great read, especially for the smallest room in the house. Like the TV network, the editorial is clearly created by knowledgeable and enthusiastic sports fans, but it's not just all vanity pieces - the interviews ask the questions that YOU would ask, political correctness and spin aside. The spread of sports is pretty broad, but female and international sports are not so well represented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Sam Bear: ESPN  the magazine provides an insiders look into the world of sports. The magazine allows for a more in depth look at today top sports stories, as well as details stories that you might not see on television.  An excellent choice for any sports fan.

What an awesome magazine. As a sports geek and  ESPN  junky myself, I couldn't be happier with my subscription!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Matt Willis: As a long time subscriber to the other big sports magazine, I was more and more disappointed with the lack of coverage of sports.  ESPN  the magazine is an extension of the network I get all of my sports news from, I recommend it to all sports enthusiasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  tadakimi takashima: I love  ESPN  the magazine!! I've subscribed to it for a couple years already but I just like how they have great pictures and articles. Although they don't go too much into detail for the articles they write, they are still interesting and worth reading. I'd recommend this magazine if you are really just like to browse through many great pictures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Brenda Burrows: This is the second time my son has received the subscription of  ESPN  the magazine. I let the first subscription run out. Every time the magazine is due he wants to know that he has received it. He is really a sports fan of all teams (he is 16 and plays football, baseball, and basketball). He has learned so much from your magazine. Keep up the good work.

Submitted By:  Versailles Agee: I purchased  ESPN  the magazine and I feel it is the best sport magazine on the market. It is a very informative magazine that helps people who wouldn normally read sport magazines read them. I love the part of the magazine that asks athletes from different sports about every day thoughts of the average person.

It is very interesting to read up on all the athletes and sports organizations around the world.  ESPN  has the best TV show in SportsCenter and now they have the best sports magazine as well. As soon as the magazine comes out, I read it from cover to cover instantly and then cannot wait for the next month issue!

Submitted By:  CURTIS NESBITT: Even my wife likes to read  ESPN  magazine. The content is geared towards the typical sports fan, but more than half of the stories in the magazine each week are biographical in nature and go into great details of the selected sports figures life. The stories revolve around sports, but are interesting on other levels as well. Like I said, my wife typically reads several articles in each issue, and she hates to watch Sportscenter. Great magazine - it comes once every two weeks, which actually works better with my schedule anyway because weekly magazines make me feel like I've wasted my money when I can't find the time to read them.

ESPN  the Magazine also sets itself apart from other sports publications by bringing a certain comedic edge to articles, livening up any story from football to curling.

With their in-depth coverage, and exciting photographs, this magazine satisfies my need for sports information. Also, its larger size allows me to really see the photos more clearly, which is a definite plus. While being the leader in sports entertainment on television, I now believe that  ESPN  is now the leader in print for sports entertainment also.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Gregory Marcin: ESPN  the Magazine has set a new standard in sports magazines. It is bigger and better than all the rest! With articles and pictures on sports from around the country and world, you can't pass on  ESPN !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Scott Friedman: ESPN  the Magazine is a must have for any sports fan. The articles are well written and the photographs really bring the athletes to life. It really differentiates itself from other sports magazines by focusing more on upcoming sporting events rather than what already happened. They also devote a good amount of space to alternative sports. This magazine is a good addition to the  ESPN  TV network and  ESPN .com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Maury Rogoff: ESPN  Magazine is one of the most visually pleasing magazines I read. If there is an occasion when I am fatigued, and just can't bring myself to read another word of text of ANYTHING, I know that I can pick up this magazine still, and enjoy the experience of perusing each page for its photographs. This is not to say that  ESPN  doesn't have great articles. It does! There are in-depth pieces on topics of interest from the world of sport, plus shorter ""front-of-book"" things to read about athletes and experiences that are fun to read. I think that  ESPN  magazine's format is pleasing and the size and feel of the magazine's pages help make it one of my favorites.  ESPN  gives me the chance to read more in-depth about sports that I know and love, as well as introduce me to sports and athletes that I am unfamiliar with, all in a stimulating, visually exciting publication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Steven Carse: ESPN  magazine is a great deal. Not only do you get an up beat product mailed to your doorstep, but you also get access to  ESPN  insider. The up to the minute analysis is always a plus. I can't imagine not having  ESPN  magazine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Submitted By:  Kenneth Smith: Unlike other sports magazines,  ESPN  the Magazine not only gives you statistics, scores and current head-to-head rivalries, it also gives you stories behind the players and teams and not just mainstream ball-driven sports but also sports like skateboarding, surfing and skiing.

The venture operates 17 ESPN and STAR Sports branded networks throughout Asia, transmitting in 5 languages ( English ,  Cantonese ,  Hindi ,  Korean  and  Mandarin ). The networks broadcast various local and international sporting events, and also local editions of  SportsCenter  for  China ,  Hong Kong ,  India ,  Taiwan ,  Malaysia  and  Southeast Asia . ESPN STAR Sports also operates a 24-hour  Cricket  channel,  STAR Cricket . STAR Sports launched STAR Sports Thailand on Monday August 4, 2008 exclusively for  Thai  viewers.   ESPN STAR Sports also has Asia's leading Event Management team that has been successfully staging large-scale sporting events across Asia. The Event Management team is a completely integrated events group that manages concept creation, sponsorship, marketing, PR, TV broadcast, operations, and logistics for clients. Events currently in their portfolio include the X Games Asia, 9 Ball Tour, KL World 5's Futsal, Cartier Polo, Formula Drift Singapore, Nations Cup Netball, Indian Hockey League, and the World Pool Championship.   One of the biggest successes for the Event Management team was the creation of the Premier Hockey League (PHL) in India. PHL is a professional league competition for field Hockey clubs in the top division of the Indian hockey system, though there has always been strong foreign representation among the players. PHL is a joint venture between ESPN STAR Sports and the erstwhile Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) but with the suspension of the IHF on April 28 2008, the future of PHL remains uncertain.

It was founded by  Scott Rasmussen  and his father Bill Rasmussen and launched on September 7, 1979, under the direction of Chet Simmons, who was the network's first President and CEO (and later became the  United States Football League 's first commissioner). Getty Oil Company provided the funding to begin the new venture.  George Bodenheimer  is ESPN's current president, a position he has held since November 19, 1998; since March 3, 2003, he has been the head of ABC Sports as well, which has since been rebranded as  ESPN on ABC  (though ABC Sports still legally has a separate existence).   ESPN's signature telecast,  SportsCenter , debuted with the network and aired its 30,000th episode on February 11, 2007. ESPN broadcasts primarily out of its studios in  Bristol, Connecticut ; it also operates offices out of  New York City ;  Seattle, Washington ;  Charlotte, North Carolina  and  Los Angeles, California ; the Los Angeles office is scheduled to open at  L.A. Live  in 2009. The name of the sport company was lengthened to ""ESPN Inc."" in February 1985.   ESPN markets itself as ""The Worldwide Leader in Sports"", a slogan that appears on nearly all company media but whose origin is unknown.   Most programming on ESPN and its affiliated networks is composed of live or tape-delayed sporting events and sports-related news programming (such as  SportsCenter ) with the remainder filled by sports-related talk shows (such as  Around the Horn ,  Jim Rome is Burning ,  Outside the Lines , and  PTI ) and sports-related documentaries.

In the mid-1970s, Rasmussen worked for the  World Hockey Association 's  New England Whalers , selling commercial time for their broadcasts. His son Scott, a former high school goaltender, was the team's  public-address announcer . Both were fired in 1977 and Rasmussen sought a new business venture. His original idea was a  cable television  network (then a fairly new medium) that focused on covering sports events in the state of  Connecticut  (for example, the  Hartford Whalers , Bristol Red Sox, and the  Connecticut Huskies ). When Rasmussen was told that buying a continuous 24-hour satellite feed was less expensive than buying several blocks of only a few hours a night, he expanded to a 24-hour nationwide network. The channel's original name was ESP, for Entertainment and Sports Programming, but it was changed prior to launch. [ 1 ]   ESPN started with the debut of  SportsCenter  hosted by  Lee Leonard  and  George Grande  on September 7, 1979. Afterwards was a pro slow pitch softball game. The first score on  SportsCenter  was from women's  tennis  on the final weekend of the  US Open .   To help fill 24 hours a day of air time, ESPN aired a wide variety of sports events that broadcast networks did not show on weekends, including  Australian Rules Football ,  Davis Cup tennis ,  professional wrestling ,  boxing , and additional  college football  and  basketball  games. The U.S. Olympic Festival, the now-defunct competition that was organized as a training tool by the  United States Olympic Committee , was also an ESPN staple during this time.     [ edit ]   Professional sports arrive   ESPN (along with the  USA Network ) was among the earliest cable-based broadcast partners for the  National Basketball Association  (NBA). Lasting from 198284, the network's relationship with the association marked its initial foray into the American professional sports sector. After an eighteen-year hiatus, ESPN (by then, under the auspices of the  ABC  network), secured a $2.4 billion/six-year broadcast contract with the NBA, thereby revitalizing its historic compact with U.S.  professional basketball .   In 1983, The  United States Football League  (USFL) made its debut on ESPN and ABC. The league (which lasted for three seasons) enjoyed ephemeral success, some portion of which was a byproduct of the exposure afforded through ESPN's coverage.   In  1987 , ESPN gained partial rights to the  National Football League . The league agreed to the deal as long as ESPN agreed to  simulcast  the games on local  television stations  in the participating  markets .  ESPN Sunday Night Football  would last for 19 years and spur ESPN's rise to legitimacy. In the 2006 NFL season, ESPN began airing  Monday Night Football , formerly seen on its sister network ABC. ( NBC  took over the Sunday night game, which replaced the Monday night contest as the league's weekly centerpiece game.) Former Commissioner  Paul Tagliabue  credits ESPN for revolutinizing the NFL, ""ESPN was able to take the draft, the pregame and highlight shows, and other NFL programming to a new level."" [ 2 ]   In 1990, ESPN added  Major League Baseball  to its lineup with a $400 million contract. [ 3 ] ; the contract has been renewed and will continue through at least 2011.  Jon Miller  and  Joe Morgan  are the longtime voices of the network's centerpiece  Sunday Night Baseball .   ESPN broadcast each of the four  major professional sports leagues  in North America from 2002 until 2004, when it cut ties with the  National Hockey League [ 4 ] ; the network had aired NHL games from 1983-86 and again since 1993.   ESPN has been broadcasting  Major League Soccer  games about once a week on ESPN2 since that league's inception in 1996. In most years, the annual  All-Star Game  and  MLS Cup  championship game, and in some years the Opening Night game, are shown on ABC broadcast stations.   ESPN broadcasts 65 sports, 24 hours a day in 15 languages in more than 150 countries. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Expansion   What set ESPN apart from the rest of the competition is that they got the top reporters for each of their respective sports by the early 1990's. Some examples included:  Peter Gammons  (baseball),  Chris Mortensen  (football),  Al Morganti  (hockey), and  David Aldridge  (basketball), and  Mel Kiper Jr.  (NFL Draft). They later added top-notch reporters including  Andrea Kremer ,  Ed Werder ,  Mark Schwartz , and  Greg Garber .   The 1990s and early 2000s saw considerable growth within the company. In 1993,  ESPN2  was founded, with  Keith Olbermann  and  Suzy Kolber  launching the network with SportsNite.  Three years later ,  ESPNEWS  was born, with  Mike Tirico  as the first  anchor . In 1997, ESPN purchased Classic Sports Network and renamed it  ESPN Classic . The latest ESPN network in the U.S.,  ESPNU , began on March 4, 2005.   ESPN International  began in the early 1990s to take advantage of the growing satellite markets in  Asia ,  Africa , and  Latin America . In  Canada , ESPN, Inc. purchased a minority share of  TSN  and  RDS  (in fact, the current corporate logo of both looks similar to that of ESPN). In 2004, ESPN finally entered the  European  market by launching a version of  ESPN Classic , and in December 2006, it agreed to purchase  North American Sports Network . On February 1st 2009, NASN was re-branded as ESPN America.  SportsCenter' s primary three broadcasts each day are at 1 a.m.  ET  (which re-airs usually until 9 AM  ET ), 6 p.m.  ET , and 11 p.m.  ET .   In 1994, ESPN set the standard for understanding the role of sports in America with the creation of  The ESPN Sports Poll  by Dr.  Richard Luker . The Sports Poll was the first ongoing national daily study of sports fan activities and interests in the United States.  Sporting News  acknowledged the accomplishments of The ESPN Sports Poll and Dr. Luker in 1996. [ 6 ]   With the increasing costs of live sports entertainment, such as the U.S.$8.8 billion costs for NFL football broadcasts rights for eight years, ""scripted entertainment has become a luxury item for ESPN,"" said David Carter, director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. [ 7 ]   From 1996 onward, ESPN was closely integrated with ABC Sports. That year,  Steve Bornstein , president of ESPN since 1990, was made president of ABC Sports as well. This integration culminated in the 2006 decision to merge ABC Sports' operations with ESPN. As a result, all of ABC's sports programming now uses  ESPN on ABC . However, ABC Sports is still legally separate from ESPN (see below).   ESPN is currently building a full-fledged broadcast production facility in downtown Los Angeles, as a part of the  L.A. Live  complex across from the  Staples Center . The five-story facility will house an ESPN Zone restaurant on the first two floors and two television production studios with digital control rooms on upper floors. It is scheduled to open in spring 2009. One of the studios will host late-night editions of  SportsCenter . [ 8 ]   In 2007, ESPN signed an agreement with the  Arena Football League  to broadcast at least one game every weekend, usually on Monday nights.   As of January 15, 2008, ESPN has signed a multi-million dollar contract with professional gaming circuit  Major League Gaming  or MLG for short. Although some have argued that professional gaming is not a physical sport, ESPN has gone ahead with this collaboration.     [ edit ]   Controversy     See also:  Criticism of ESPN       [ edit ]   Ownership history   As mentioned, William Rasmussen founded the show. Just before ESPN launched,  Getty Oil  Company (later purchased by  Texaco , which in turn was acquired by  Chevron ) agreed to buy a majority stake in the network.   In 1984,  ABC  made a deal with Getty Oil to acquire ESPN. ABC retained an 80% share, and sold 20% to  Nabisco . The Nabisco shares were later sold to  Hearst Corporation , which still holds a 20% stake today. In 1986, ABC was purchased for $3.5 billion by  Capital Cities Communications . In 1995,  The Walt Disney Company  purchased Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion and picked up an 80% stake in ESPN at that time. According to an analysis published by  Barron's  magazine in February 2008, ESPN ""is probably worth more than 40% of Disney's entire value... based on prevailing cash-flow multiples in the industry.""   Although ESPN has been operated as a Disney subsidiary since 1996, it is still technically a  joint venture  between Disney and Hearst. ESPN will take a relation with Disney's new channel, Disney XD, which is replacing Toon Disney     [ edit ]   ESPNHD   ESPNHD , launched March 30, 2003, is a  720p   high-definition   simulcast  of the cable television network  ESPN , both owned by  Disney  that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ESPNHD along with sister network ABCHD use the  720p  HD line standard because the  ABC  executives proposed a progressive 'p' signal resolves fluid and high speed motion in sports better, particularly during slow motion replays. [ 9 ]   All Bristol studio shows and most live events on ESPN are produced high definition. ESPN is one of the few networks with an all-digital infrastructure. Shows that are recorded elsewhere  such as  Jim Rome Is Burning  ( Los Angeles );  Pardon the Interruption  and  Around the Horn  ( Washington, D.C. ) are presented in a standard definition, 4:3 format with stylized  pillar boxes . ESPN, however maintains a policy that any video that originates in  high definition  must remain in HD when aired on ESPNHD. Unlike all other sports programming networks, ESPN charges for its HD channel.   Recently the network has come under considerable scrutiny from industry technicians and early adopters of HD due to a recent noticeable degradation in picture quality, specifically during live events. It is unclear whether this is the result of over-compression, rate shaping or bit starving from cable and satellite providers or something amiss in the ESPN distribution chain.

Many movies with a general sports theme will include ESPN announcers and programming into their storylines (such as in  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story , which gently lampoons the channel's multiple outlets by referencing the as-yet-nonexistent ESPN8, ""The Ocho"" [ 24 ] , a reference to a nickname sometimes used for ESPN2, ""the Deuce""). In the theatrical hit ""Waterboy"", Adam Sandler's character Bobby Boucher has his college football accomplishes tracked through several fictional ""SportsCenter"" new casts including the ""Bourbon Bowl."" Also, ESPN.com Page 2 columnist Bill Simmons often jokes that he is looking forward to running a future network in any given column;  SportsCenter  anchors appeared as themselves in  music videos  by Brad Paisley ("" I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song) "") and  Hootie and the Blowfish  (""Only Wanna Be With You""); and the short-lived 1998 TV series  Sports Night  (by  West Wing  creator  Aaron Sorkin ) was based around an ESPN-style network and its titular,  SportsCenter -analogue flagship sports results program.   Many jokes have been made by comedians about fake obscure sports that are shown on ESPN.  Dennis Miller  mentioned watching "" sumo   rodeo ,"" while  George Carlin  stated that ESPN showed ""Australian  dick   wrestling "". One of several  Saturday Night Live  skits poking fun at the network features ESPN2 airing a show called  Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly , which includes a fake advertisement for ""Senior Women's Beach Lacrosse."" In the early years of ESPN, ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" even featured a ""Top Ten List"" poking fun at some the obscure sports seen on ESPN at the time. One of the more memorable sports on the list was ""Amish Rake Fighting.""   There are at least 22 children named after the network.

It was founded by  Scott Rasmussen  and his father Bill Rasmussen and launched on September 7, 1979, under the direction of Chet Simmons, who was the network's first President and CEO (and later became the  United States Football League 's first commissioner). Getty Oil Company provided the funding to begin the new venture.  George Bodenheimer  is ESPN's current president, a position he has held since November 19, 1998; since March 3, 2003, he has been the head of ABC Sports as well, which has since been rebranded as  ESPN on ABC  (though ABC Sports still legally has a separate existence).   ESPN's signature telecast,  SportsCenter , debuted with the network and aired its 30,000th episode on February 11, 2007. ESPN broadcasts primarily out of its studios in  Bristol, Connecticut ; it also operates offices out of  New York City ;  Seattle, Washington ;  Charlotte, North Carolina  and  Los Angeles, California ; the Los Angeles office is scheduled to open at  L.A. Live  in 2009. The name of the sport company was lengthened to ""ESPN Inc."" in February 1985.   ESPN markets itself as ""The Worldwide Leader in Sports"", a slogan that appears on nearly all company media but whose origin is unknown.   Most programming on ESPN and its affiliated networks is composed of live or tape-delayed sporting events and sports-related news programming (such as  SportsCenter ) with the remainder filled by sports-related talk shows (such as  Around the Horn ,  Jim Rome is Burning ,  Outside the Lines , and  PTI ) and sports-related documentaries.

In the mid-1970s, Rasmussen worked for the  World Hockey Association 's  New England Whalers , selling commercial time for their broadcasts. His son Scott, a former high school goaltender, was the team's  public-address announcer . Both were fired in 1977 and Rasmussen sought a new business venture. His original idea was a  cable television  network (then a fairly new medium) that focused on covering sports events in the state of  Connecticut  (for example, the  Hartford Whalers , Bristol Red Sox, and the  Connecticut Huskies ). When Rasmussen was told that buying a continuous 24-hour satellite feed was less expensive than buying several blocks of only a few hours a night, he expanded to a 24-hour nationwide network. The channel's original name was ESP, for Entertainment and Sports Programming, but it was changed prior to launch. [ 1 ]   ESPN started with the debut of  SportsCenter  hosted by  Lee Leonard  and  George Grande  on September 7, 1979. Afterwards was a pro slow pitch softball game. The first score on  SportsCenter  was from women's  tennis  on the final weekend of the  US Open .   To help fill 24 hours a day of air time, ESPN aired a wide variety of sports events that broadcast networks did not show on weekends, including  Australian Rules Football ,  Davis Cup tennis ,  professional wrestling ,  boxing , and additional  college football  and  basketball  games. The U.S. Olympic Festival, the now-defunct competition that was organized as a training tool by the  United States Olympic Committee , was also an ESPN staple during this time.     [ edit ]   Professional sports arrive   ESPN (along with the  USA Network ) was among the earliest cable-based broadcast partners for the  National Basketball Association  (NBA). Lasting from 198284, the network's relationship with the association marked its initial foray into the American professional sports sector. After an eighteen-year hiatus, ESPN (by then, under the auspices of the  ABC  network), secured a $2.4 billion/six-year broadcast contract with the NBA, thereby revitalizing its historic compact with U.S.  professional basketball .   In 1983, The  United States Football League  (USFL) made its debut on ESPN and ABC. The league (which lasted for three seasons) enjoyed ephemeral success, some portion of which was a byproduct of the exposure afforded through ESPN's coverage.   In  1987 , ESPN gained partial rights to the  National Football League . The league agreed to the deal as long as ESPN agreed to  simulcast  the games on local  television stations  in the participating  markets .  ESPN Sunday Night Football  would last for 19 years and spur ESPN's rise to legitimacy. In the 2006 NFL season, ESPN began airing  Monday Night Football , formerly seen on its sister network ABC. ( NBC  took over the Sunday night game, which replaced the Monday night contest as the league's weekly centerpiece game.) Former Commissioner  Paul Tagliabue  credits ESPN for revolutinizing the NFL, ""ESPN was able to take the draft, the pregame and highlight shows, and other NFL programming to a new level."" [ 2 ]   In 1990, ESPN added  Major League Baseball  to its lineup with a $400 million contract. [ 3 ] ; the contract has been renewed and will continue through at least 2011.  Jon Miller  and  Joe Morgan  are the longtime voices of the network's centerpiece  Sunday Night Baseball .   ESPN broadcast each of the four  major professional sports leagues  in North America from 2002 until 2004, when it cut ties with the  National Hockey League [ 4 ] ; the network had aired NHL games from 1983-86 and again since 1993.   ESPN has been broadcasting  Major League Soccer  games about once a week on ESPN2 since that league's inception in 1996. In most years, the annual  All-Star Game  and  MLS Cup  championship game, and in some years the Opening Night game, are shown on ABC broadcast stations.   ESPN broadcasts 65 sports, 24 hours a day in 15 languages in more than 150 countries. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Expansion   What set ESPN apart from the rest of the competition is that they got the top reporters for each of their respective sports by the early 1990's. Some examples included:  Peter Gammons  (baseball),  Chris Mortensen  (football),  Al Morganti  (hockey), and  David Aldridge  (basketball), and  Mel Kiper Jr.  (NFL Draft). They later added top-notch reporters including  Andrea Kremer ,  Ed Werder ,  Mark Schwartz , and  Greg Garber .   The 1990s and early 2000s saw considerable growth within the company. In 1993,  ESPN2  was founded, with  Keith Olbermann  and  Suzy Kolber  launching the network with SportsNite.  Three years later ,  ESPNEWS  was born, with  Mike Tirico  as the first  anchor . In 1997, ESPN purchased Classic Sports Network and renamed it  ESPN Classic . The latest ESPN network in the U.S.,  ESPNU , began on March 4, 2005.   ESPN International  began in the early 1990s to take advantage of the growing satellite markets in  Asia ,  Africa , and  Latin America . In  Canada , ESPN, Inc. purchased a minority share of  TSN  and  RDS  (in fact, the current corporate logo of both looks similar to that of ESPN). In 2004, ESPN finally entered the  European  market by launching a version of  ESPN Classic , and in December 2006, it agreed to purchase  North American Sports Network . On February 1st 2009, NASN was re-branded as ESPN America.  SportsCenter' s primary three broadcasts each day are at 1 a.m.  ET  (which re-airs usually until 9 AM  ET ), 6 p.m.  ET , and 11 p.m.  ET .   In 1994, ESPN set the standard for understanding the role of sports in America with the creation of  The ESPN Sports Poll  by Dr.  Richard Luker . The Sports Poll was the first ongoing national daily study of sports fan activities and interests in the United States.  Sporting News  acknowledged the accomplishments of The ESPN Sports Poll and Dr. Luker in 1996. [ 6 ]   With the increasing costs of live sports entertainment, such as the U.S.$8.8 billion costs for NFL football broadcasts rights for eight years, ""scripted entertainment has become a luxury item for ESPN,"" said David Carter, director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. [ 7 ]   From 1996 onward, ESPN was closely integrated with ABC Sports. That year,  Steve Bornstein , president of ESPN since 1990, was made president of ABC Sports as well. This integration culminated in the 2006 decision to merge ABC Sports' operations with ESPN. As a result, all of ABC's sports programming now uses  ESPN on ABC . However, ABC Sports is still legally separate from ESPN (see below).   ESPN is currently building a full-fledged broadcast production facility in downtown Los Angeles, as a part of the  L.A. Live  complex across from the  Staples Center . The five-story facility will house an ESPN Zone restaurant on the first two floors and two television production studios with digital control rooms on upper floors. It is scheduled to open in spring 2009. One of the studios will host late-night editions of  SportsCenter . [ 8 ]   In 2007, ESPN signed an agreement with the  Arena Football League  to broadcast at least one game every weekend, usually on Monday nights.   As of January 15, 2008, ESPN has signed a multi-million dollar contract with professional gaming circuit  Major League Gaming  or MLG for short. Although some have argued that professional gaming is not a physical sport, ESPN has gone ahead with this collaboration.     [ edit ]   Controversy     See also:  Criticism of ESPN       [ edit ]   Ownership history   As mentioned, William Rasmussen founded the show. Just before ESPN launched,  Getty Oil  Company (later purchased by  Texaco , which in turn was acquired by  Chevron ) agreed to buy a majority stake in the network.   In 1984,  ABC  made a deal with Getty Oil to acquire ESPN. ABC retained an 80% share, and sold 20% to  Nabisco . The Nabisco shares were later sold to  Hearst Corporation , which still holds a 20% stake today. In 1986, ABC was purchased for $3.5 billion by  Capital Cities Communications . In 1995,  The Walt Disney Company  purchased Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion and picked up an 80% stake in ESPN at that time. According to an analysis published by  Barron's  magazine in February 2008, ESPN ""is probably worth more than 40% of Disney's entire value... based on prevailing cash-flow multiples in the industry.""   Although ESPN has been operated as a Disney subsidiary since 1996, it is still technically a  joint venture  between Disney and Hearst. ESPN will take a relation with Disney's new channel, Disney XD, which is replacing Toon Disney     [ edit ]   ESPNHD   ESPNHD , launched March 30, 2003, is a  720p   high-definition   simulcast  of the cable television network  ESPN , both owned by  Disney  that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ESPNHD along with sister network ABCHD use the  720p  HD line standard because the  ABC  executives proposed a progressive 'p' signal resolves fluid and high speed motion in sports better, particularly during slow motion replays. [ 9 ]   All Bristol studio shows and most live events on ESPN are produced high definition. ESPN is one of the few networks with an all-digital infrastructure. Shows that are recorded elsewhere  such as  Jim Rome Is Burning  ( Los Angeles );  Pardon the Interruption  and  Around the Horn  ( Washington, D.C. ) are presented in a standard definition, 4:3 format with stylized  pillar boxes . ESPN, however maintains a policy that any video that originates in  high definition  must remain in HD when aired on ESPNHD. Unlike all other sports programming networks, ESPN charges for its HD channel.   Recently the network has come under considerable scrutiny from industry technicians and early adopters of HD due to a recent noticeable degradation in picture quality, specifically during live events. It is unclear whether this is the result of over-compression, rate shaping or bit starving from cable and satellite providers or something amiss in the ESPN distribution chain.

Major advertisers such as  Apple Inc. ,  FedEx , and  United Parcel Service  are continually buying advertisements to reach the 15-35 year old male audience. ESPN's ad revenue averages $441.8 million with an ad rate of $9,446 per 30 second slot.

Many movies with a general sports theme will include ESPN announcers and programming into their storylines (such as in  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story , which gently lampoons the channel's multiple outlets by referencing the as-yet-nonexistent ESPN8, ""The Ocho"" [ 24 ] , a reference to a nickname sometimes used for ESPN2, ""the Deuce""). In the theatrical hit ""Waterboy"", Adam Sandler's character Bobby Boucher has his college football accomplishes tracked through several fictional ""SportsCenter"" newscasts including the ""Bourbon Bowl."" Also, ESPN.com Page 2 columnist Bill Simmons often jokes that he is looking forward to running a future network in any given column;  SportsCenter  anchors appeared as themselves in  music videos  by Brad Paisley ("" I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song) "") and  Hootie and the Blowfish  (""Only Wanna Be With You""); and the short-lived 1998 TV series  Sports Night  (by  West Wing  creator  Aaron Sorkin ) was based around an ESPN-style network and its titular,  SportsCenter -analogue flagship sports results program.   Many jokes have been made by comedians about fake obscure sports that are shown on ESPN.  Dennis Miller  mentioned watching "" sumo   rodeo ,"" while  George Carlin  stated that ESPN showed ""Australian  dick   wrestling "". One of several  Saturday Night Live  skits poking fun at the network features ESPN2 airing a show called  Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly , which includes a fake advertisement for ""Senior Women's Beach Lacrosse."" In the early years of ESPN, ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" even featured a ""Top Ten List"" poking fun at some the obscure sports seen on ESPN at the time. One of the more memorable sports on the list was ""Amish Rake Fighting.""   There are at least 22 children named after the network.

(May 2008) ESPN Launched September 7, 1979 Owned by The Walt Disney Company (80%) Hearst Corporation (20%) Picture format 480i (SDTV) 720p (HDTV) Slogan The Worldwide Leader in Sports Country  United States Language English Headquarters Bristol, Connecticut Formerly called Entertainment and Sports Programming Network ESP (never used on air) Website ESPN.com Availability Satellite DirecTV 206 Dish Network 140 (SD) 9424 (HD) Cable Available on most cable systems Check local listings for channels ESPN, formerly an initialism for Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, is an American cable television network dedicated to broadcasting and producing sports-related programming 24 hours a day. It was founded by Scott Rasmussen and his father Bill Rasmussen and launched on September 7, 1979, under the direction of Chet Simmons, who was the network's first President and CEO (and later became the United States Football League's first commissioner). George Bodenheimer is ESPN's current president, a position he has held since November 19, 1998; since March 3, 2003, he has been the head of ABC Sports as well, which has since been rebranded as ESPN on ABC (though ABC Sports still legally has a separate existence). ESPN's signature telecast, SportsCenter, debuted with the network and aired its 30,000th episode on February 11, 2007. ESPN broadcasts primarily out of its studios in Bristol, Connecticut; it also operates offices out of New York City, New York; Seattle, Washington; Charlotte, North Carolina and Los Angeles, California; the Los Angeles office is scheduled to open at L.A. Live in 2009. The name of the sport company was lengthened to ""ESPN Inc."" in February 1985. ESPN considers itself ""The Worldwide Leader in Sports"", a slogan that appears on nearly all company media but whose origin is unknown. Most programming on ESPN and its affiliated networks is composed of live or tape-delayed sporting events and sports-related news programming (such as 'SportsCenter') with the remainder filled by sports-related talk shows (such as 'Around the Horn' and 'PTI') and sports-related documentaries.

( The Walt Disney Company / Hearst Corporation )       Country     United States       Language   English       Website   www.espn.go.com/magazine/       ISSN   [http://www.worldcat.org/issn/1097-1998 1097-1998       ESPN The Magazine  is a bi-weekly sports  magazine  published by the  ESPN  sports network in  Bristol, CT  in the  United States . The first issue was published on  March 11 ,  1998 .   The main sports covered include  Major League Baseball ,  NBA ,  NFL ,  NHL ,  college basketball  and  college football . The magazine typically takes a more light-hearted and humorous approach to sporting news compared to competitors such as  Sports Illustrated  and  Sporting News . It often covers players whose careers have suffered as a result of incidents off the field.     [ edit ]   Departments   Here are some of the regular departments, in their magazine order:     Open Look :  Dan Le Batard  gives his opinion on  sport 's current controversies.   The Sports Guy :  Bill Simmons , who writes for  ESPN.com 's  Page2 , tries to give an alternative point of view on a sporting issue.   Two Way :  Stuart Scott  answers questions from readers, giving his own opinions.   The Biz :  Peter Keating  writes about the business side of sports and its effect on the sporting world.   The Post : Looking back at the previous edition of the magazine with some of the readers' comments and updates on past stories.   Zoom : Three or four large pictures of the week's games, taken by photographers from around the country.   The Jump : A mix of different regular features, offering an alternative and usually humorous take on the current sporting scene.   Outtakes : A transcript of an interview from  The Dan Patrick Show  with a sport star mostly talking about non sports issues. Interviews now done by  Kenny Mayne .   0:01 : The last page of the magazine, this is used for an irreverent look at a big sporting story via a single, altered photo. For example, in 2005 NFL veterans  Jerome Bettis ,  Brett Favre  and  Jerry Rice  were digitally edited to appear to be in the  Rolling Stones . A compilation of these has been released as a book.   The Life of Reilly : Former  Sports Illustrated  columnist  Rick Reilly  gives his opinions on the sports world, and reports upon various ""special interest"" stories in sports.   NEXT Athlete : Yearly award given out to young rising star athletes       [ edit ]   References     espnmag.com   http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/index       [ edit ]   External links     ESPN The Magazine   ESPN The Magazine Video on ESPN Video Archive                   v      d      e     ESPN Inc.                           ESPN executives               George Bodenheimer      Sean Bratches     Christine Driessen     Edwin Durso     Chuck Pagano     John Skipper     Norby Williamson      Russell Wolff                                   ESPN family of networks               ESPN      ESPN2      ESPN on ABC      ESPNEWS      ESPN Classic      ESPNU      ESPN Deportes      ESPNHD      ESPN2HD      ESPNEWSHD     ESPN Plus      ESPN PPV      ESPN360      ESPN Radio      ESPN Deportes Radio      ESPN Xtra      ESPN All Access                                   ESPN International               ESPN Australia      ESPN Brasil      ESPN Dos      ESPN Latin America      ESPN+      ESPN Star Sports      ESPN America                                   Current ESPN business ventures               ESPN.com      ESPN Original Entertainment      ESPN The Magazine      ESPN Deportes La Revista      ESPN Books      ESPN MVP      ESPN Zone      ESPY Awards      ESPN Integration                                   Defunct ESPN business ventures               ESPN Extra     ESPN Now     ESPN West                                   Sports properties               Arena Football League      College Football      Major League Baseball      Major League Soccer      ESPNsoccernet      National Football League      NASCAR      National Basketball Association      Women's National Basketball Association      Indy Racing League       List of Programming Rights                                   Canadian ventures with  CTVglobemedia               Animal Planet Canada      Discovery Channel Canada      Discovery Civilization Channel      Discovery HD Canada      ESPN Classic Canada      NHL Network Canada      RDS      RIS      TSN      TSN2      WTSN  (now defunct)     Viewers Choice                                   Other properties               Jayski's Silly Season Site      F1-Live.com      Racing-Live.com      TrueHoop      Cricinfo                                   Key programs               Around the Horn      Baseball Tonight      College GameDay  (football)      E:60      ESPN College Football Primetime      ESPN First Take      Friday Night Fights      Jim Rome Is Burning      Mike and Mike in the Morning      Monday Night Countdown      Monday Night Football      NBA Friday      NASCAR Countdown      NASCAR Now      NBA Shootaround      Outside the Lines      Pardon the Interruption      Saturday Primetime      College GameDay  (basketball)      SportsCenter      Sunday NFL Countdown      Sunday Night Baseball      MLS Primetime Thursday      The Herd with Colin Cowherd                                   Notable personalities               John Anderson      Erin Andrews      Skip Bayless      Chris Berman      Bonnie Bernstein      Michelle Bonner      Mike Breen      Hubie Brown      John Buccigross      John Clayton      Jonathan Coachman      Linda Cohn      Chris Connelly      Lee Corso      Colin Cowherd      Jay Crawford      Rece Davis      Chris Fowler      Ron Franklin      Peter Gammons      Mike Greenberg      Mike Golic      Jay Harris      Kirk Herbstreit      Lou Holtz      Brock Huard      Tom Jackson      Dana Jacobson      Brian Kenny      Shaun King      Suzy Kolber      Tony Kornheiser      Tim Legler      Bob Ley      Steve Levy      Jay Mariotti      Kenny Mayne      Sean McDonough      Chris McKendry      Barry Melrose      Jon Miller      Joe Morgan      Brent Musburger      Brad Nessler      Rachel Nichols      Woody Paige      Jesse Palmer      Mike Patrick      Steve Phillips      Derek Rae      Karl Ravech      Tony Reali      Jim Rome      Holly Rowe      John Saunders      Mark Schlereth      Stuart Scott      Howie Schwab      Dan Shulman      Michael Smith      Stephen A.

The Lions could save $4.6 million in cap space by  releasing Bodden before he is due a roster bonus in February, MLive.com reports. Fantasy Spin:  Bodden was wholly unspectacular in his first season in Detroit, and unless the team's new coaching staff envisions him as a major 2009 contributor, he's most likely going to be sent packing.   Daunte Culpepper The Lions would save $5 million in ... The Lions would save $5 million in cap space if they release Culpepper before he is due a roster bonus in February, according to MLive.com. Fantasy Spin:  Culpepper performed no better than a mediocre backup in his short stint with the Lions this season, so a $5 million price tag will probably be too expensive to keep him in the Motor City. On the other hand, Detroit could lose its top performer at quarterback, Dan Orlovsky, via free agency, and the team showed no confidence in Drew Stanton, so they may want to keep Culpepper around to man the ship until they can find a more long term solution.   Chris Ellis Ellis only played in seven games in ... Ellis only played in seven games in a rookie season that ended with him on injured reserve with an ankle injury. Fantasy Spin:  He was supposed to be a top depth guy for the defensive end spot but was slow to develop, finishing with only three tackles and no sacks before the injury. Given the slow start, he'll probably need a full season of getting his feet wet before we have a better hope of him becoming an NFL regular.   Jamaal Anderson Anderson (ankle) finished the 2008 regular season ... Anderson (ankle) finished the 2008 regular season with 27 tackles and two sacks in 15 games. Fantasy Spin:  While Anderson improved on his sack total -- which was 0 in the previous season -- we're not seeing the all-pro caliber talent he was supposed to be as a first-round pick in 2007. He split time often with Chauncey Davis, who proved to be the better pass rusher toward the end of the season. Anderson will have the inside track to retain the starting job, but his worth as an IDP selection is pretty bleak until we start seeing some better tackle and sack numbers.   Gary Russell Coach Mike Tomlin endorsed Russell as a ... Coach Mike Tomlin endorsed Russell as a viable short yardage runner during his press conference on Tuesday. Fantasy Spin:  ""He's a one trick pony,"" Tomlin said of Russell's penchant for running downhill. The Steelers back converted two third-and-short attempts in Week 11 against the Chargers after San Diego stopped Mewelde Moore earlier in the game on the goal-line. Russell ran for three short touchdowns in his last five games, increasing the chances gets the opportunity again on Sunday.

Workouts over the next month or two are likely to determine that. But regardless of draft status, Maualuga has become an outright celebrity while starring for USC, a status that may have ultimately been cemented by this, unwitting tango with ESPN sideline reporter extraordinaire Erin Andrews, which was dug up and sent our way by L.A. TIMES blogger Adam Rose.    Yes, that’s Maualuga who walks all the way from the sideline to inches behind Andrews and busts some serious ...

(Hat tip to Adam Rose at All Things Trojan.)               Rey Maualuga Gets Down With Erin Andrews    Published 5 days ago at  The Sporting Blog        The only reason to watch the Rose Bowl once USC took its 31-7 lead became the insane level of celebration the Trojans (and their coaches) enjoyed. L.A. hasn't seen that much boogie since Chris Kaman's last bout with the common cold. ABC's cameras didn't transmit the best jig of the game, though.

Rey Maualuga Dances With Erin Andrews    Published 5 days ago at  FanIQ Blog        Rey Maualuga is likely going to be one of the top linebackers taken in this year's NFL Draft, but I honestly think it'll be hard for him to ever have it better than he did while he was at USC. Maualuga is an absolute legend down in SoCal, yet he somehow managed to raise the bar another notch during USC's annual Rose Bowl rout by sneaking up behind Erin Andrews at some point and busting a dance move on her.     Not even Matt Leinart's that's smooth. Or that hilarious. And let's be honest, it's not like Maualuga had anything better to do during the game anyway.     By the way, ...

It looks like Erin Andrews had a little too much to report on on the sidelines at the Rose Bowl. Rey Maualuga from the USC Trojans saw an opportunity to dance, and he took it. She had no idea what in the world he was doing, and he might have gotten slapped for his hip movements, but she just fled like he was a huge man standing right behind her for no good reason. All in all, it seems like just a little fun at Erin’s Expense. The bottom vid is him in action on the field. ...

Erin Andrews gets Maualugad    Published 5 days ago by Reezy at  The Sports Culture        USC’s Rey Maualuga, best described as the Chuck Norris of college football, can do what he wants. Rules do not apply.   Maybe it’s because he punk fools like this and this. Either way, with such a level of badassness, Maualuga officially gets his name transformed into a verb. And who better to debut it on than Erin Andrews?   Surely, someday “getting Maualuga’d” will turn into a YouTube phenomenon, as did the stanky legg did. Until then, all we can do is provide video evidence of Miss Erin getting startled and moderately freaked out following the ...

Rey Maualuga Needs To Be Taught Some Manners [Erin Andrews]    Published 4 days ago by Dashiell Bennett at  Deadspin        Rey Maualuga may be an All-American, a Bednarik Award winner, and a Rose Bowl champion, but if he thinks that gives him the right to harass America's Sideline Princess—he's dead wrong.  Yes, we've seen the video and we are not amused. Rey must have thought he was pretty funny picking on Erin Andrews when she wasn't looking. This is more like school in the summertime—which as a player for the USC football team I'm sure he knows nothing about. It's good thing his college career is over, because I don't think Mr. Funnyman is getting any post-game interview love anytime soon. You don't mess with ...

The back and forth affair ended on a 22-yard run by Chargers backup running back Darren Sproles, who saw extended time as LaDainian Tomlinsons groin injury caused him to leave the game early.   While many  myself included  believed it would be the Colts nine-game winning streak that continued, Philip Rivers and the Bolts proved it was their four-game run that would carry over into next weeks game. ...

Rey Maualuga Makes Horny Male Sports Fans Insanely Jealous    Published 4 days ago by Matt Clapp (sharapovasthigh@gmail.com) at  Sharapova's Thigh        To a non-sports fan, Erin Andrews would probably be considered attractive, doable, etc. However, for us sports fans, she's so much more. When you mix attractiveness with the fact that she likes sports, and actually knows sports, it takes her from about a 7.5 to a 9 on the hotness scale. USC star linebacker Rey Maualuga gets that, and that's why when he saw her cute ass on the sidelines during the Rose Bowl, he had to get close, and give it some grindage. You've probably already seen this video on just about any other sports blog out there.

Deportes  means ""sports"" in Spanish. The channel broadcasts transmissions made in  Mexico City  and in  Bristol, Connecticut   In 2007, the network began a daily English segment on the late edition of its American parent's  SportsCenter , hosted by  Michele LaFountain  and several other personalities.

Cablevision  offers the channel to its digital cable subscribers.  Time Warner Cable  is expected to add ESPN Deportes sometime in 2007.   Other ESPN networks occasionally air commercials that ask viewers to call 1-800-DEPORTES or log on to the ESPN Deportes website (see below) to express their interest in adding the network to its lineup if it is not available to them.

This happened because two of the redundant high definition encoder sets lost power and eliminated the English video and audio feeds in  Houston , presumably due to a  thunderstorm  in the area. The only way a picture could be sent back to be transmitted from headquarters in  Bristol, Connecticut  through the satellite and to the viewers at home was to use the Deportes standard definition feed.   Despite the thunderstorm, the game continued because  Minute Maid Park  has a retractable roof and because power was never lost in the stadium.
