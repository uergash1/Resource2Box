Both are compulsory to pass the unit.     The mark ""PL"" on a subject means that you must have 30 minutes at that moment to hold a personal tutored hour with your teacher (30 minutes).

I’ll be there to talk about the work we  at  TSO  have been doing with  OPSI  to add semantic information to the  London Gazette  using RDFa. It’s really interesting and timely work on all sorts of levels; you can  read the abstract of the talk  to get a taster and of course it’ll be published afterwards.                            equality   xtech2008                          2 comments   Read more                      Girls and computers: just three things          Fri, 2007-10-05 22:04  Jeni              One:  My article  in the  Women in Technology  series came out about a month ago. It was actually inspired by  this comment  on the post I wrote a while ago on women in computing, which asked about encouraging your daughters to take up computing. I found it easier to write about that than my own experiences, which have been rather mundane.    Two: Read  OMG Girlz Don’t Exist on teh Intarweb!!!! . It’d be hilarious if it weren’t so dreadful.    Three: We’ve been looking at possible infant (ages 4-7) schools for our eldest. The two nearest both have interactive whiteboards in all the classrooms and regular IT lessons. In one school, the children are taught how to touch type; this at an age when they can hardly read and write. When I was in school, touch typing was on typewriters, for the girls who aspired to be secretaries. (I  Mavis Beacon ‘d myself during my year out of university; it’s the most frequently used skill I have next to the ability to read.)                            children   equality                          2 comments                      Unconscious assumptions based on gender          Wed, 2007-08-22 16:15  Jeni              I was reading the  Draft TAG Finding on Dereferencing HTTP URIs  the other day. It has a load of “Stories” in it: examples that illustrate the technical points of the document. In general, examples fall into three categories:      examples that illustrate an expert doing the right thing   examples that illustrate a beginner doing the right thing   examples that illustrate a beginner doing the wrong thing (and being corrected)      What I realised as I read the stories in this document was that the gender of the protagonist of the story changed how I read them. In particular, when the protagonist was female (as in the stories in this Finding), I assumed that they were a beginner, and probably doing something wrong.                            equality                          4 comments   Read more                      Programming robots the feminine way?          Sun, 2007-07-22 21:26  Jeni              I recently filled in a  questionnaire  that asked about the use of robots in teaching programming. (You can win a robot!) Some of the questions seemed to be particularly about attracting women into the field; I guess the thinking is that programming something that does something in the real world is more engaging (particularly for women?) than doing artificial exercises in linked list manipulation. Or something.    I like programming robots as much as the next geek, and am the proud owner of two regular  Lego Mindstorms  kits as well as a less complex, but more evil, Dark Side Developers Kit. Thinking around this, it struck me that there are two classes of projects you can do with robots:      a  directive  program, where you tell the robot exactly what to do (go forward for 5 seconds, turn, forward for 2 seconds etc.)   a  facilitative  program, where you define the feedback between sensors and motors, then just let the robot go                              coding   equality                          Add new comment   Read more                      Do we need more women in computing?          Thu, 2007-06-21 21:45  Jeni              Woah, so  Tim  took me seriously about  linking to women’s blog posts  from  his own , and suddenly I get readership!  Edd   phrases what I was trying to say  better than I did myself:        As Jeni brings her article to a close, it’s with some shock and shame that I get the punchline loud and clear: “this isn’t about you.”        It’s about empathy, inclusivity and selflessness. Human qualities that are unrestricted to either gender.      But I wanted to address some of the comments that question whether we should really care about this.  For example :        Why we need to have an equal number of men and women in every job field known to man is beyond me. Women freely choose not to be programmers. That is manifestly not a problem, and certainly not a problem that needs fixing. I try to respect peoples decisions about what they do with their lives, so I for one vow to do absolutly [sic] nothing about this.                              equality                          3 comments   Read more                      How to get women into computing          Sat, 2007-06-16 21:59  Jeni              I’ve been thinking about the low proportion of women in computing since reading  Tim Bray ’s post about  the lack of women at RailsConf :        Geeks, you know, theyre admittedly obsessive about computers, but once you get past that theyre on average a pretty eclectic, amusing, and warm-hearted bunch. And in recent years I havent met a single one who wasnt upset about the missing gender. If a booming female Voice From On High spoke out, saying, Do this and well rejoin your profession, well I bet a lot of us would do whatever it was. But failing that, in the meantime the problem isnt getting better.                              equality                          33 comments   Read more                                                        Jeni Tennison                                                         Recent posts      Working With Fragmented Overlapping Markup   1 week 4 days  ago   Representing Overlap in XML   3 weeks 14 hours  ago   Essential Hierarchy   4 weeks 2 days  ago   Overlap, Containment and Dominance   4 weeks 5 days  ago   rdfQuery: Progressive Enhancement with RDFa   7 weeks 5 days  ago   more            Recent comments      Re: Decision making evden eve nakliye (not verified) 5 days 4 hours  ago   Re: Mixed XML/LMNL John Cowan (not verified) 1 week 1 day  ago   Re: Pipelining in XSLT Jeni 1 week 2 days  ago   Re: Pipelining in XSLT Martin A (not verified) 1 week 2 days  ago   Re: 95% capacity nakliyat (not verified) 2 weeks 1 day  ago

This standardized exam is administered by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and is used to evaluate the skills and knowledge of prospective medical students. If you want to study medicine at a North American university or medical school you have to take the  MCAT . The  MCAT  is given twice a year, once in April and once in August. It is divided into four sections:   •  Verbal Reasoning  (VR)     •  Physical Sciences (PS) •  Biological Sciences  (BS)    •  Writing Sample  (WS)   The first three sections are multiple-choice tests. This means, you have to select the correct answer to each question. In the writing sample section you have to compose two short essays which are evaluated by AAMC examiners. Your scores for the three multiple-choice sections can range from 1 to 15. Your maximum combined score can be 45 but if your score is over 30 you already have a fair chance of being admitted to a medical school. In the verbal reasoning section you have to answer 60 multiple-choice questions that measure your comprehension, evaluation, and application of information gathered from written text passages. To prepare for this  section of the MCAT  you can take the 246 free interactive tests which contain 1230 unique  MCAT words .

Ju ...            Submitted by rodrigo on 25 January, 2008 - 19:14.           A multitude of discourses have emerged relative to the internationalism of Blacks worldwide and particularly in the Americas, but the prominence and impact of the Black presence in Europe has not been adequately explored. This seminar will examine the multiple constructions of the term Black Europe and the social, economic and political implications within.                         »  2 comments  |  Read more  |  1 attachment  |  send to friend                                       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 & next : last                                          ""all different - all equal""  is a campaign of the  Council of Europe                      "

He also runs  Seesmic , which is a startup that makes a variety of services and tools for what Loic calls ""the instant Web."" I call it the World Wide talk show and say that Loic is host. We discuss how the web is turning real time thanks to services like Twitter, FriendFeed, and Seesmic, and how Seesmic enables a new style of video conversation.

So...i try on Safari (on pc)...the fs is not available !!  really too bad. so i have to go on IE :-(((                                   Posted by  Henrik Ahlen  (not verified) on December 26, 2008 9:04 PM              Great conversation about important possibilities! I like the term ""instant web"", it signifies the shift into an ""always on"" net-based communication mode that has already changed the lives of some of us and will be an even bigger change for the masses than the switch from modems to broadband had.  I also agree that countries matter less and think that is a good thing. We will always be local patriots, but there will be less wars and much more understanding if we communicate every day with people from around the world.  And online video will be the key tool for this, both user-generated like in Seesmic and professionally produced content that the users can interact with.

That is true instant web                                   Posted by  francine hardwawy  (not verified) on December 25, 2008 2:37 AM              I love the idea of the real time web. It will take a while for it to spread everywhere, but it will. I'm like you guys, I don't mind putting it out there for everyone to see. The next generation will be more like us. But right now, private conversations would take care of the issues most people face. And yes, Seesmic is really a conversation (sometimes).  Thanks for this video. Your videos are getting better and better:-)                                   Posted by  Kelley  (not verified) on December 23, 2008 11:33 PM              I am new in the tech world and it seems a bit daunting at times.  I have learned a great deal from both of you gentlemen today.  The video makes me feel as though I am sitting there with you getting to really know you.  I want to introduce you to my family audience standing around me, listening to you.  In general, most people do not have 20 minutes to listen, but, they will always have the option to listen to pieces and parts of it.  My hope is that I can learn from your innovations and make it work for me in this current economy.  Thank you for your insight and may your future business ventures be greatly blessed!                                   Posted by  not convinced  (not verified) on December 23, 2008 11:16 PM              The problem with video comments is they generally make you sound really stup*d. It is the rare orator that can be convincing when they are being recorded by a static camera, under poor lighting, and are unscripted, and unedited. Look at most of Scoble's Qik or Skype videos for example. He is a profession with years of video experience. More often than not these Qik and Skype videos make him sound like an idi*t.                                   Posted by  Anonymous  (not verified) on December 23, 2008 10:01 PM              Hey Robert, nice video as usual.  Loic's interview was awesome; it provided a lot of insights.  By the way, interview more tech people man, like Max Levchin, folks at Yelp, etc.  Thanks!                                   Posted by  @sam_piroton  (not verified) on December 23, 2008 8:59 PM              Hey Robert & Loic, great video. But i have to say that i completely disagree with you on one thing: this vid shoud be on seesmic ! i don't care about length if it's worth, if it has value. And i think it has...so...and Robert, instead of having ""link to yur video comment"" why not have seesmic implemented on this site? :)   Thks guys for sharing your ideas & discussions                                   Posted by  @sam_piroton  (not verified) on December 23, 2008 8:55 PM              OOooops seems you don't like my seesmic vid :)   http://new.seesmic.com/videos/5MNJiI9eTP                                   Posted by  Chris  (not verified) on December 23, 2008 8:41 PM              Another great interview Robert. I think Seesmic is smart to have a three to five year strategy. I don't believe 2009 is the breakout year for their type of video communication. I know Twitter and FriendFeed geeks that do nothing with video at all. It's still a little too cumbersome for most (even tech savvy) people. Maybe 2010?                                   Posted by  Niall Harbison  (not verified) on December 23, 2008 7:35 PM              Really excellent post. I am a big fab of a longer video interview like this as unlike short super edited clips it gives you a real insight into what the people are really like. You both came accross very well and both knew your subject inside out. Excellent video and jealous about the weather :)                                   Posted by  @nicktalop  (not verified) on December 23, 2008 5:18 PM              Great conversation, and very inspiring. I like loic's humble approach on the future of the web and seesmic. Virtual goods? that sounds like something to invest in!

Scobleizer TV Exclusive: Seagate Introduces New HD Media Storage and Sharing Device Posted by Anonymous on Sunday, January 11, 2009 - 21:14 I suspect this will be semi-hobbled...  Most devices in this class are crippled depending on how afraid of RIAA the corporation making it is...  (the blockbuster box has all the user's own media blocked all-together).  Wish the gov't would stand up to RIAA  before we all have 500 diff boxes each with slightly different capabilities hanging off our snazzy new HDTVs...
